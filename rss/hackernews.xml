<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content uk-width-4-5@m uk-width-1-1@s&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week we filed a lawsuit in Arizona against Namecheap, a domain name registrar, as well as its&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;proxy service, Whoisguard, for registering domain names that aim to deceive people by pretending to be affiliated with Facebook apps. These domain names can trick people into believing they are legitimate and are often used for phishing, fraud and scams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We regularly scan for domain names and apps that infringe our trademarks to protect people from abuse. We found that Namecheap’s proxy service, Whoisguard, registered or used 45 domain names that impersonated Facebook and our services, such as instagrambusinesshelp.com, facebo0k-login.com and whatsappdownload.site. We sent notices to Whoisguard between October 2018 and February 2020, and despite their obligation to provide information about these infringing domain names, they declined to cooperate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t want people to be deceived by these web addresses, so we’ve taken legal action. We filed a similar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/fighting-domain-name-fraud/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;lawsuit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in October 2019 against OnlineNIC, another domain registrar, and its proxy service. Our goal is to create consequences for those who seek to do harm and we will continue to take legal action to protect people from domain name fraud and abuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software as a service—or SaaS—market is going gangbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s great news for SaaS companies, and in many cases for customers, who prefer to essentially rent their software and receive automatic updates rather than buy it outright and be responsible for its upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscription software usually requires less hardware and personnel to run. It’s updated and improved frequently—which means it often offers more features and functionality than software out of a box. And SaaS companies are known to be responsive with customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ibj-mugRight-Lg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;wheeler-brad-tech-expert.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/mugs-Large/W/wheeler-brad-tech-expert.jpg&quot;/&gt; Wheeler&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the initial cost—with SaaS companies offering myriad payment options and introductory offers—is often lower than buying and maintaining software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time, costs add up. In fact, the expense of software subscriptions—on a per-employee basis—is now rivaling the sky-high costs of providing employees and their families with health insurance. As a result, the proliferation of SaaS has become a big problem for the companies that use it and a giant headache for many information technology administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In some ways, this is like a runaway train,” said Brad Wheeler, vice president for information technology at Indiana University. Every chief information officer “has his hair on end about this. And we still don’t know where this is going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide SaaS market is on a trajectory that would make any Wall Street analyst salivate. It has grown from $5.6 billion in 2008 to a whopping $116.4 billion in 2018, according to research firm Statista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;software-charts.png&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/IBJ-Print2/2019/050319/software-charts.png&quot;/&gt;Numbers from another leading research firm, Gartner, are slightly lower but show the same dramatic growth curve. Both research firms project the SaaS market will continue to climb at an annual rate of 17% to 23% over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of companies that rely solely on subscription-based software is also rapidly rising. In 2016, that number was just 38%, according to Statista. This year, it is 58%, and Statista projects it will be 73% next year—and could reach 86% by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Oracle—which in 2016 announced that all of its software would soon be moved to the cloud and sold on a subscription basis—are pushing the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While software subscriptions have been around for decades, the SaaS explosion was triggered by several factors from 2012 to 2014, tech experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It came during a time when a lot of corporate computer technology got old and was being changed,” Wheeler said. “At the same time, cloud companies matured and there arose this fear that technology was changing so fast that companies’ software and hardware would quickly become outdated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to that, tech experts said, the ease of access to cloud technology made it relatively simple for an entrepreneur with a bit of technological savvy and vision to launch a SaaS company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, many niche SaaS products were born to solve specific problems. All those new software options turned corporate heads and other employees into kids in a proverbial candy store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business model is genius for SaaS companies. Subscriptions give them what tech investors covet most: annual recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big deal to get that total contract on the books and have a guaranteed source of income for a set number of years,” Wheeler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology business experts told IBJ that SaaS companies often run gross margins as high as 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely a high-margin business across the board,” an IT administrator told IBJ. “You’re essentially running one machine, but selling it to a lot of customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creeping costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To no surprise, annual software subscription costs have also gone up—way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent analysis of more than 30 million transactions, Zylo—a local firm that helps its customers track and manage software subscriptions—found enterprise companies are spending an average of more than $10,000 per employee per year on software. So, for every 100 employees, companies are spending $1 million on software subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ibj-mugRight-Lg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;christopher-eric-mug-tech-exec&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/mugs-Large/C/christopher-eric-mug-tech-exec.jpg&quot;/&gt; Christopher&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the average cost for a company to provide health care to an employee and his or her dependents is about $14,000 per year, according to the National Business Group on Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies are spending tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars a year on software” subscriptions, said Zylo CEO Eric Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Zylo data, companies with 1,000 employees have an average of 500 subscriptions. That can include basics like the Microsoft Office suite or specialty software like ADP’s payroll services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have more subscriptions than they do employees, Christopher said, and the phenomenon is not limited to big companies. Zylo, for instance, has 60 employees and nearly 80 software subscriptions, he said. He admits to having 12 subscriptions himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaaS companies make it easy to get started and often entice potential customers with introductory offers or payment options that make the programs look like a bargain compared with buying software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s this thought that you can subscribe to something for one year and see how it goes,” Christopher said. “In reality, though, subscriptions get locked in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can cause SaaS expenses to creep up almost unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ibj-mugRight-Lg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Konow&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/mugs-Large/K1/konow-chris-mug-tech-exec.jpg&quot;/&gt; Konow&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Little by little, each [subscription] decision seems like a modest step,” said IU’s Wheeler. “But at some point, it becomes real money—real big money. If you’re not careful, you find yourself renting it for $1,000 a month when you could buy it for $300 a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t necessarily the number of software subscriptions a company has or their cost, said Chris Konow, vice president of CleanSlate Technology Group, a Carmel consultancy with a practice devoted to software spend management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern is making sure a company is getting an appropriate return for the subscriptions and eliminating waste and duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We preach that you need to put people in place that have an ownership of this issue, and you need a formal road map or process in place to track these expenses,” Konow said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that, he said, a number of problems arise, not the least of which is that no one knows how much money is going out the door to pay for all the subscription software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT chiefs losing control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns for corporate IT administrators is software subscriptions acquired without the knowledge or control of the IT department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, administrators said, leads companies to pay for duplicative services and sign deals that don’t leverage the buying power of the entire organization—not to mention the security concerns that come with tying various software services into a company’s central system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to research firm IDC, 60% of U.S. technology spending occurs outside companies’ IT department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ibj-mugRight-Lg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fleming&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/mugs-Large/F/fleming-robin-mug-tech-exec.jpg&quot;/&gt; Fleming&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This can be a serious issue for the IT department. There’s a real sense of losing control over this,” said Robin Fleming, former chief technology officer for Angie’s List who is now CEO and co-founder of Anvl, a local cloud-based software firm that markets business-safety applications to reduce and prevent injuries for maintenance workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has to be a balance between letting team members innovate and determine what they need and being so locked down that it stifles the company,” Fleming added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you do have to have a method to monitor the spend. Having policies in place, doing formal audits and having someone or a firm dedicated to tracking the SaaS spend is really critical now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleming said managing SaaS spending is one of the top two concerns—along with cybersecurity—of any IT department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s how big of a deal this is,” she emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company can get subscription software for just about anything these days. There’s Microsoft Office 365 for backbone office needs; Workday for human resources and financial management; and collaboration software like Dropbox, WebEx, GoToMeeting and Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are loads of marketing software packages, including Salesforce’s extensive suite. There are subscriptions for financial functions such as Financial Force, QuickBooks and Expensify. There are also subscriptions for services like Google Ads and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual subscription costs, tech experts said, run from about $100 to millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many subscriptions, Christopher said, cost $8,000 or so a month—or about $100,000 a year. And it’s not uncommon, he added, for subscriptions costing $10,000 to $50,000 annually “to never be seen by the IT department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seismic shift in the way companies are handling computing needs is causing some to change their internal structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering 2017, only 30% of chief information officers had a cloud computing/SaaS strategy, according to Gartner. Just two years later, that number is 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy alone isn’t enough. IT administrators told IBJ that implementing a serious software subscriptions management plan can save a company as much as 30% on its SaaS bill. For a 200-employee company, that could be an annual savings of $600,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zylo’s Christopher isn’t convinced companies have a handle on SaaS spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They think they do, but they don’t,” he said. “Most companies don’t have anyone monitoring which subscriptions are being ordered and if they’re being used and what they’re being used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen companies buy the same subscription over and over again—even within the same department,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies have human resources managers looking over employee issues, health care professionals managing the insurance and benefits programs, but no dedicated software manager. It’s too big an expense to let go unchecked and not coordinated. And the problem is only getting bigger.”•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Intel x86 Root of Trust: Loss of Trust</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2020/03/intelx86-root-of-trust-loss-of-trust.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GL-knFVL1TI/Xl5-cNQqJ8I/AAAAAAAAICY/lefULeycnqYUzNZANjh-8YAi324cuRafgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/shutterstock_small.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fire-burning-blazing-computer-motherboard-cpugpu-1617430696&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;809&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1213&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GL-knFVL1TI/Xl5-cNQqJ8I/AAAAAAAAICY/lefULeycnqYUzNZANjh-8YAi324cuRafgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/shutterstock_small.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scenario that Intel system architects, engineers, and security specialists perhaps feared most is now a reality. A vulnerability has been found in the ROM of the Intel Converged Security and Management Engine (CSME). This vulnerability jeopardizes everything Intel has done to build the root of trust and lay a solid security foundation on the company's platforms. The problem is not only that it is impossible to fix firmware errors that are hard-coded in the Mask ROM of microprocessors and chipsets. The larger worry is that, because this vulnerability allows a compromise at the hardware level, it destroys the chain of trust for the platform as a whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive Technologies specialists have discovered an error in Intel hardware, as well as an error in Intel CSME firmware at the very early stages of the subsystem's operation, in its boot ROM. Intel CSME is responsible for initial authentication of Intel-based systems by loading and verifying all other firmware for modern platforms. For instance, Intel CSME interacts with CPU microcode to authenticate UEFI BIOS firmware using BootGuard. Intel CSME also loads and verifies the firmware of the Power Management Controller responsible for supplying power to Intel chipset components.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Even more importantly, Intel CSME is the cryptographic basis for hardware security technologies developed by Intel and used everywhere, such as DRM, fTPM, and Intel Identity Protection. In its firmware, Intel CSME implements EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID). EPID is a procedure for remote attestation of trusted systems that allows identifying individual computers unambiguously and anonymously, which has a number of uses: these include protecting digital content, securing financial transactions, and performing IoT attestation. Intel CSME firmware also implements the TPM software module, which allows storing encryption keys without needing an additional TPM chip—and many computers do not have such chips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Intel tried to make this root of trust as secure as possible. Intel's security is designed so that even arbitrary code execution in any Intel CSME firmware module would not jeopardize the root cryptographic key (Chipset Key), but only the specific functions of that particular module. Plus, as the thinking went, any risks could be easily mitigated by changing encryption keys via the security version number (SVN) mechanism. This was demonstrated in 2017, when an arbitrary code execution vulnerability was found in the BringUP (bup) firmware module, as described in Intel SA-00086. At that time, Intel simply generated new keys by incrementing the SVN, easily preventing any compromise of EPID-based technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, no security system is perfect. Like all security architectures, Intel's had a weakness: the boot ROM, in this case. An early-stage vulnerability in ROM enables control over reading of the Chipset Key and generation of all other encryption keys. One of these keys is for the Integrity Control Value Blob (ICVB). With this key, attackers can forge the code of any Intel CSME firmware module in a way that authenticity checks cannot detect. This is functionally equivalent to a breach of the private key for the Intel CSME firmware digital signature, but limited to a specific platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The EPID issue is not too bad for the time being because the Chipset Key is stored inside the platform in the One-Time Programmable (OTP) Memory, and is encrypted. To fully compromise EPID, hackers would need to extract the hardware key used to encrypt the Chipset Key, which resides in Secure Key Storage (SKS). However, this key is not platform-specific. A single key is used for an entire generation of Intel chipsets. And since the ROM vulnerability allows seizing control of code execution before the hardware key generation mechanism in the SKS is locked, and the ROM vulnerability cannot be fixed, we believe that extracting this key is only a matter of time. When this happens, utter chaos will reign. Hardware IDs will be forged, digital content will be extracted, and data from encrypted hard disks will be decrypted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The vulnerability discovered by Positive Technologies affects the Intel CSME boot ROM on all Intel chipsets and SoCs available today other than Ice Point (Generation 10). The vulnerability allows extracting the Chipset Key and manipulating part of the hardware key and the process of its generation. However, currently it is not possible to obtain that key's hardware component (which is hard-coded in the SKS) directly. The vulnerability also sets the stage for arbitrary code execution with zero-level privileges in Intel CSME.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We will provide more technical details in a full-length white paper to be published soon. We should point out that when our specialists contacted Intel PSIRT to report the vulnerability, Intel said the company was already aware of it (CVE-2019-0090). Intel understands they cannot fix the vulnerability in the ROM of existing hardware. So they are trying to block all possible exploitation vectors. The patch for CVE-2019-0090 addresses only one potential attack vector, involving the Integrated Sensors Hub (ISH). We think there might be many ways to exploit this vulnerability in ROM. Some of them might require local access; others need physical access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;As a sneak peek, here are a few words about the vulnerability itself:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The vulnerability is present in both hardware and the firmware of the boot ROM. Most of the IOMMU mechanisms of MISA (Minute IA System Agent) providing access to SRAM (static memory) of Intel CSME for external DMA agents &lt;strong&gt;are disabled by default&lt;/strong&gt;. We discovered this mistake by simply reading the documentation, as unimpressive as that may sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Intel CSME firmware in the boot ROM first initializes the page directory and starts page translation. IOMMU activates only later. Therefore, there is a period when SRAM is susceptible to external DMA writes (from DMA to CSME, not to the processor main memory), and initialized page tables for Intel CSME are already in the SRAM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;MISA IOMMU parameters are reset when Intel CSME is reset. After Intel CSME is reset, it again starts execution with the boot ROM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Therefore, any platform device capable of performing DMA to Intel CSME static memory and resetting Intel CSME (or simply waiting for Intel CSME to come out of sleep mode) can modify system tables for Intel CSME pages, thereby seizing execution flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Mark Ermolov, Positive Technologies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>BMW’s new flat logo is everything that’s wrong with modern logo design</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21163766/bmw-new-flat-logo-design-bad-transparent-background-cars</link>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;lKr4rN&quot;&gt;BMW has a new logo, marking the biggest change to the company’s branding since the iconic emblem was introduced in 1917. As with many modern redesigns of logos made to chase today’s trendy aesthetic of a super flat ultra-minimalist style, the new BMW logo sacrifices the company’s well-known identity in favor of presumed modernity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pZ5DPN&quot;&gt;There are two major changes to the updated logo. The first is largely positive: BMW is reverting back to a flatter design that ditches the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dated 3D effects and shading that were introduced in 1997 with a design that resembles the simpler logo the company has been using since 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oDoOVC&quot;&gt;The second change is the removal of the black outer ring in favor of a transparent background, which just looks plain bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;J9hopM&quot;&gt;I get that the transparent logo effect is &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to look cool and minimalist. Jens Thiemer, senior vice president of customer and brand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/bmw-logo-meaning-history1.html&quot;&gt;says it was designed to&lt;/a&gt; “radiate more openness and clarity,” but the effect is anything but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i1s40z&quot;&gt;Sure, it looks nice on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162530/bmw-i4-electric-sedan-concept-geneva-motor-show-2020&quot;&gt;BMW’s bronze-hued electric i4 sedan concept&lt;/a&gt;, but what about on a white BMW? Or a letterhead? Or on a sign for a BMW dealership on a highway? The effect is less “clarity” and more like someone on the creative team got sloppy and accidentally deleted the background on the Photoshop file before they exported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pMGr35&quot;&gt;There’s a reason why we don’t see many transparent backgrounds with white text on them from most companies: a lot of our screens and signs still have plain white backgrounds because that makes it easy to read things. Remove the black ring from the logo, and we’re left with a far less distinctive shape that doesn’t read as “BMW” in the way that the black / white / blue emblem has for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8iZb1E&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the transparent effect makes it harder to parse the logo as a whole from a distance: where you once might have registered the outer ring with the “BMW” lettering and the blue-and-white inner disc as a single unit, making the outside ring transparent means that the company is forced to rely on just that single inner element to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;602Qjq&quot;&gt;BMW is, of course, not the only company we’ve seen go down this route in the past few years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065443/godaddy-logo-redesign-rebrand-website-domain&quot;&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20879814/yahoo-new-logo-endless-slide-irrelevance-pentagram&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9239769/new-google-logo-announced&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947854/facebook-new-logo-design-change-parent-company-instagram-whatsapp&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motor1.com/news/369756/volkswagen-new-logo-unveiled/&quot;&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, and plenty of other companies have made similar changes that discarded well-known designs in favor of what I like to think of as the “Instagram startup” aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Zrl4Mo&quot;&gt;BMW hasn’t said when we should expect the new logo to show up on its production cars just yet. But given that it’s already made its way across BMW’s website and social media pages, it’ll only be a matter of time before it adorns the hood of your next sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Discovering the brain’s nightly “rinse cycle”</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posted on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-03-05T09:00:00-05:00&quot; pubdate=&quot;&quot;&gt;March 5th, 2020&lt;/time&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://directorsblog.nih.gov/author/collinsfs/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by Dr. Francis Collins&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Dr. Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eEszNmVFFm4?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting plenty of deep, restful sleep is essential for our physical and mental health. Now comes word of yet another way that sleep is good for us: it triggers rhythmic waves of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that appear to function much like a washing machine’s rinse cycle, which may help to clear the brain of toxic waste on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video above uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to take you inside a person’s brain to see this newly discovered rinse cycle in action. First, you see a wave of blood flow (red, yellow) that’s closely tied to an underlying slow-wave of electrical activity (not visible). As the blood recedes, CSF (blue) increases and then drops back again. Then, the cycle—lasting about 20 seconds—starts over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, are the first to suggest that the brain’s well-known ebb and flow of blood and electrical activity during sleep may also trigger cleansing waves of blood and CSF. While the experiments were conducted in healthy adults, further study of this phenomenon may help explain why &lt;a href=&quot;https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2019/02/05/sleep-loss-encourages-spread-of-toxic-alzheimers-protein/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;poor sleep or loss of sleep (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;poor sleep or loss of sleep&lt;/a&gt; has previously been associated with the spread of toxic proteins and worsening memory loss in people with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Laura Lewis, Boston University, MA, and her colleagues at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. recorded the electrical activity and took fMRI images of the brains of 13 young, healthy adults as they slept. The NIH-funded team also built a computer model to learn more about the fluid dynamics of what goes on in the brain during sleep. And, as it turns out, their sophisticated model predicted exactly what they observed in the brains of living humans: slow waves of electrical activity followed by alternating waves of blood and CSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis says her team is now working to come up with even better ways to capture CSF flow in the brain during sleep. Currently, people who volunteer for such experiments have to be able to fall asleep while wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap inside of a noisy MRI machine—no easy feat. The researchers are also recruiting older adults to begin exploring how age-related changes in brain activity during sleep may affect the associated fluid dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People kept working, became healthier while on basic income: report</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/basic-income-mcmaster-report-1.5485729</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/basic-income-mcmaster-report-1.5485729</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
This Hamilton man was one of the basic income pilot project recipients featured by photographer Jessie Golem in a photo essay about the damage done by the cancellation of the project. (Jessie Golem)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;142.80156220941&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants in Ontario's prematurely cancelled basic income pilot project were happier, healthier and continued working even though they were receiving money with no-strings attached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's according to a new report titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/southern-ontarios-basic-income-experience.pdf&quot;&gt;Southern Ontario's Basic Income Experience&lt;/a&gt;, which was compiled by researchers at McMaster and Ryerson University, in partnership with the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;inread-wrapper-id-5676257&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report shows nearly three-quarters of respondents who were working when the pilot project began kept at it despite receiving basic income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That finding appears to contradict the criticism some levelled at the project, saying it would sap people's motivation to stay in the workforce or seek employment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;They continued working,&quot; Wayne Lewchuk, an economics prof at McMaster University who was part of the research team told &lt;em&gt;As It Happens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Many of those who continued working were actually able to move to better jobs, jobs that had a higher hourly wage, that had in general better working conditions, that they felt were more secure.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The three-year, $150-million program was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lisa-macleod-announcement-1.4768626&quot;&gt;scrapped by Ontario's PC government in July&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, then-social services minister Lisa MacLeod, said the decision was made because the program was failing to help people become &quot;independent contributors to the economy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday a spokesperson for Todd Smith, the current minister of children, community and social services sent CBC a statement saying the government is focused on programs aimed at empowering &quot;unemployed or underemployed&quot; people across the province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A research project that included only 4,000 individuals was not an adequate solution for a province where almost two million people are living in poverty,&quot; wrote Christine Wood. &quot;We are focused on solutions for Ontario that are practical and sustainable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A 'low-cost way' to build a foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the report points to a wide range of positives after just one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its findings are the result of a 70-question, anonymous online survey made available to basic income recipients in Hamilton, Brantford and Brant County. A total of 217 former recipients participated, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty in-depth interviews with participants were also completed in July 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember one individual who said 'Look, I was on the edge of suicide. I just felt nobody cared about me. I didn't know how to make ends meet and now with basic income I feel like I can be part of society,'&quot; Lewchuk recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80 per cent of respondents reported better overall health while taking part in the program. More than half said they were using less tobacco and 48 per cent said they were drinking less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Wayne Lewchuk, professor emeritus of labour studies and economics at McMaster University, talks to As It Happens host Carol Off about Ontario's basic income pilot project that was scrapped by the Progressive Conservative government. 6:33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to mental health, 83 per cent of those surveyed described feeling stressed or anxious less often and 81 per cent said they felt more self-confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An improved diet, better housing security and less-frequent hospital visits were other outcomes respondents pointed to, along with 66 per cent who said they formed better relationships with family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What became clear is that as people moved to some stability their health improved, their mental health improved, their outlook on life improved,&quot; said Lewchuk. &quot;You have to believe that actually made them more employable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Wayne Lewchuk is one of the researchers behind the report that surveyed participants about the affect Ontario's basic income pilot project had on their lives. (McMaster Institute for Health Equity)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's in contrast to the situation for participants once the plug was pulled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Almost all survey respondents indicated that the pilot's cancellation forced them to place on hold or abandon certain life plans,&quot; reads the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project worked by recruiting low-income people and couples, offering them a fixed payment with no strings attached that worked out to approximately $17,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever income participants earned was deducted from their basic income at 50 per cent, meaning once someone hit $34,000 they wouldn't receive a payment anymore, Lewchuk explained while speaking with &lt;em&gt;As It Happens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A 'tragedy' pilot didn't run for 3 years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic income payments were about 15-20 per cent higher than ODSP, said the professor, but the benefits of people visiting the hospital less often and paying more taxes would offset that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In terms of the net cost to a province, it's not monumental.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewchuk added that while some people did stop working, about half of them headed back to school in hopes of coming back to a better job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged the report's findings are only based on short-term effects but, given the project has been shut down, it's all they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just don't have the data to understand what happened in the long run. This is the tragedy of the pilot not running for three years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;teaser&quot;&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc805.txt&quot;&gt;11th of January 1982&lt;/a&gt; twenty-two computer scientists met to discuss an issue with ‘computer mail’ (now known as email). Attendees included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy&quot;&gt;the guy who would create Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lebling&quot;&gt;the guy who made Zork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Mills&quot;&gt;the NTP guy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fabry&quot;&gt;the guy who convinced the government to pay for Unix&lt;/a&gt;. The problem was simple: there were 455 hosts on the ARPANET and the situation was getting out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/arpanet-1969.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ARPANET circa 1969&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue was occuring now because the ARPANET was on the verge of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc801.txt&quot;&gt;switching&lt;/a&gt; from its original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Program&quot;&gt;NCP protocol&lt;/a&gt;, to the TCP/IP protocol which powers what we now call the Internet. With that switch suddenly there would be a multitude of interconnected networks (an ‘Inter... net’) requiring a more ‘hierarchical’ domain system where ARPANET could resolve its own domains while the other networks resolved theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other networks at the time had great names like “COMSAT”, “CHAOSNET”, “UCLNET” and “INTELPOSTNET” and were maintained by groups of universities and companies all around the US who wanted to be able to communicate, and could afford to lease 56k lines from the phone company and buy the requisite &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11&quot;&gt;PDP-11s&lt;/a&gt; to handle routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saccade.com/writing/projects/PDP11/PDP-11.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/pdp11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PDP-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original ARPANET design, a central Network Information Center (NIC) was responsible for maintaining a file listing every host on the network. The file was known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HOSTS.TXT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file, similar to the &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file on a Linux or OS X system today. Every network change would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc952.txt&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; the NIC to FTP (a protocol invented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114&quot;&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;) to every host on the network, a significant load on their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single file list every host on the Internet would, of course, not scale indefinitely. The priority was email, however, as it was the predominant addressing challenge of the day. Their ultimate conclusion was to create a hierarchical system in which you could query an external system for just the domain or set of domains you needed. In their words: “The conclusion in this area was that the current ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a7d2d4c2d5e7cfc8d4d3&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;’ mailbox identifier should be extended to ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8afff9eff8cae2e5f9fea4eee5e7ebe3e4&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;’ where ‘domain’ could be a hierarchy of domains.” And the domain was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/cybergeography/atlas/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/arpanet.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ARPANET Map&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to dispel any illusion that these decisions were made with prescience for the future the domain name would have. In fact, their elected solution was primarily decided because it was the “one causing least difficulty for existing systems.” For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc799.txt&quot;&gt;one proposal&lt;/a&gt; was for email addresses to be of the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;domain&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If email usernames of the day hadn’t already had ‘.’ characters you might be emailing me at ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ef958e8c84c18c83809a8b89838e9d8aaf8c8082&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;’ today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uucpandthebangpath&quot;&gt;UUCP and the Bang Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.8987341772152&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been said that the principal function of an operating system is to define a number of different names for the same object, so that it can busy itself keeping track of the relationship between all of the different names. Network protocols seem to have somewhat the same characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— David D. Clark, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc814.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1982&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien116.txt&quot;&gt;failed proposal&lt;/a&gt; involved separating domain components with the exclamation mark (&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;). For example, to connect to the &lt;code&gt;ISIA&lt;/code&gt; host on &lt;code&gt;ARPANET&lt;/code&gt;, you would connect to &lt;code&gt;!ARPA!ISIA&lt;/code&gt;. You could then query for hosts using wildcards, so &lt;code&gt;!ARPA!*&lt;/code&gt; would return to you every &lt;code&gt;ARPANET&lt;/code&gt; host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of addressing wasn’t a crazy divergence from the standard, it was an attempt to maintain it. The system of exclamation separated hosts dates to a data transfer tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP&quot;&gt;UUCP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf&quot;&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. If you’re reading this on an OS X or Linux computer, &lt;code&gt;uucp&lt;/code&gt; is likely still installed and available at the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARPANET was introduced in 1969, and quickly became a powerful communication tool... among the handful of universities and government institutions which had access to it. The Internet as we know it wouldn’t become publically available outside of research institutions until &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cybertelecom.org/notes/nsfnet.htm&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, twenty one years later. But that didn’t mean computer users weren’t communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/coupler.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acoustic Coupler&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era before the Internet, the general method of communication between computers was with a direct point-to-point dial up connection. For example, if you wanted to send me a file, you would have your modem call my modem, and we would transfer the file. To craft this into a network of sorts, UUCP was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this system, each computer has a file which lists the hosts its aware of, their phone number, and a username and password on that host. You then craft a ‘path’, from your current machine to your destination, through hosts which each know how to connect to the next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sw-hosts!digital-lobby!zack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/uucp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Business card featuring UUCP address&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This address would form not just a method of sending me files or connecting with my computer directly, but also would be my email address. In this era before ‘mail servers’, if my computer was off you weren’t sending me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While use of ARPANET was restricted to top-tier universities, UUCP created a bootleg Internet for the rest of us. It formed the basis for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&quot;&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system&quot;&gt;BBS&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dns&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the DNS system we still use today would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc882.txt&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. If you run a DNS query today, for example using the &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; tool, you’ll likely see a response which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.   299 IN  A 172.217.4.206
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is informing us that google.com is reachable at &lt;code&gt;172.217.4.206&lt;/code&gt;. As you might know, the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is informing us that this is an ‘address’ record, mapping a domain to an IPv4 address. The &lt;code&gt;299&lt;/code&gt; is the ‘time to live’, letting us know how many more seconds this value will be valid for, before it should be queried again. But what does the &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; stands for ‘Internet’. Like so much of this, the field dates back to an era when there were several competing computer networks which needed to interoperate. Other potential values were &lt;code&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosnet&quot;&gt;CHAOSNET&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;code&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt; for Hesiod which was the name service of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena&quot;&gt;Athena system&lt;/a&gt;. CHAOSNET is long dead, but a much evolved version of Athena is still used by students at MIT to this day. You can find the list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml&quot;&gt;DNS classes&lt;/a&gt; on the IANA website, but it’s no surprise only one potential value is in common use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tlds&quot;&gt;TLDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.7590361445783&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely unlikely that any other TLDs will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— John Postel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1591&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;year&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was decided that domain names should be arranged hierarchically, it became necessary to decide what sits at the root of that hierarchy. That root is traditionally signified with a single ‘.’. In fact, ending all of your domain names with a ‘.’ is semantically correct, and will absolutely work in your web browser: &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com.&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;google.com.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first TLD was &lt;code&gt;.arpa&lt;/code&gt;. It allowed users to address their old traditional ARPANET hostnames during the transition. For example, if my machine was previously registered as &lt;code&gt;hfnet&lt;/code&gt;, my new address would be &lt;code&gt;hfnet.arpa&lt;/code&gt;. That was only temporary, during the transition, server administrators had a very important choice to make: which of the five TLDs would they assume? “.com”, “.gov”, “.org”, “.edu” or “.mil”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say DNS is hierarchical, what we mean is there is a set of root DNS servers which are responsible for, for example, turning &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; nameservers, who will in turn answer how to get to &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;. The root DNS zone of the internet is composed of thirteen DNS server clusters. There are only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internic.net/zones/named.cache&quot;&gt;13 server clusters&lt;/a&gt;, because that’s all we can fit in a single UDP packet. Historically, DNS has operated through UDP packets, meaning the response to a request can never be more than 512 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root DNS servers operate in safes, inside locked cages. A clock sits on the safe to ensure the camera feed hasn’t been looped. Particularily given how slow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions&quot;&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/a&gt; implementation has been, an attack on one of those servers could allow an attacker to redirect all of the Internet traffic for a portion of Internet users. This, of course, makes for the most fantastic heist movie to have never been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the nameservers for top-level TLDs don’t actually change all that often. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dns.measurement-factory.com/writings/wessels-pam2003-paper.pdf&quot;&gt;98%&lt;/a&gt; of the requests root DNS servers receive are in error, most often because of broken and toy clients which don’t properly cache their results. This became such a problem that several root DNS operators had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.as112.net/&quot;&gt;spin up&lt;/a&gt; special servers just to return ‘go away’ to all the people asking for reverse DNS lookups on their local IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TLD nameservers are administered by different companies and governments all around the world (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verisign.com/&quot;&gt;Verisign&lt;/a&gt; manages &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;). When you purchase a &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; domain, about $0.18 goes to the ICANN, and $7.85 &lt;a href=&quot;http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/61467/if-icann-only-charges-18%C2%A2-per-domain-name-why-am-i-paying-10&quot;&gt;goes to&lt;/a&gt; Verisign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;punycode&quot;&gt;Punycode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rare in this world that the silly name us developers think up for a new project makes it into the final, public, product. We might name the company database Delaware (because that’s where all the companies are registered), but you can be sure by the time it hits production it will be CompanyMetadataDatastore. But rarely, when all the stars align and the boss is on vacation, one slips through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punycode is the system we use to encode unicode into domain names. The problem it is solving is simple, how do you write 比薩.com when the entire internet system was built around using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII&quot;&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; alphabet whose most foreign character is the tilde?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a simple matter of switching domains to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode&quot;&gt;unicode&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035&quot;&gt;original documents&lt;/a&gt; which govern domains specify they are to be encoded in ASCII. Every piece of internet hardware from the last fourty years, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/crs-1-multishelf-system/model.html&quot;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/release-independent/junos/information-products/pathway-pages/t-series/t1600/&quot;&gt;Juniper&lt;/a&gt; routers used to deliver this page to you make that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web itself was &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1994q3/1085.html&quot;&gt;never ASCII-only&lt;/a&gt;. It was actually originally concieved to speak &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1&quot;&gt;ISO 8859-1&lt;/a&gt; which includes all of the ASCII characters, but adds an additional set of special characters like ¼ and letters with special marks like ä. It does not, however, contain any non-Latin characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restriction on HTML was ultimately removed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2070&quot;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; and that same year Unicode &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html&quot;&gt;became&lt;/a&gt; the most popular character set on the web. But domains were still confined to ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/ie-hebrew.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hebrew in IE 5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess, Punycode was not the first proposal to solve this problem. You most likely have heard of UTF-8, which is a popular way of encoding Unicode into bytes (the 8 is for the eight bits in a byte). In the year &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jseng-utf5-01&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; several members of the Internet Engineering Task Force came up with UTF-5. The idea was to encode Unicode into five bit chunks. You could then map each five bits into a character allowed (A-V &amp;amp; 0-9) in domain names. So if I had a website for Japanese language learning, my site 日本語.com would become the cryptic M5E5M72COA9E.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This encoding method has several disadvantages. For one, A-V and 0-9 are used in the output encoding, meaning if you wanted to actually include one of those characters in your doman, it had to be encoded like everything else. This made for some very long domains, which is a serious problem when each segment of a domain is restricted to 63 characters. A domain in the Myanmar language would be restricted to no more than 15 characters. The proposal does make the very interesting suggestion of using UTF-5 to allow Unicode to be transmitted by Morse code and telegram though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the question of how to let clients know that this domain was encoded so they could display them in the appropriate Unicode characters, rather than showing M5E5M72COA9E.com in my address bar. There were &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-compare-01&quot;&gt;several suggestions&lt;/a&gt;, one of which was to use an unused bit in the DNS response. It was the “last unused bit in the header”, and the DNS folks were “very hesitant to give it up” however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion was to start every domain using this encoding method with &lt;code&gt;ra--&lt;/code&gt;. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-race-00&quot;&gt;the time&lt;/a&gt; (mid-April 2000), there were no domains which happened to start with those particular characters. If I know anything about the Internet, someone registered an &lt;code&gt;ra--&lt;/code&gt; domain out of spite immediately after the proposal was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492&quot;&gt;ultimate conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, reached in 2003, was to adopt a format called Punycode which included a form of delta compression which could dramatically shorten encoded domain names. Delta compression is a particularily good idea because the odds are all of the characters in your domain are in the same general area within Unicode. For example, two characters in Farsi are going to be much closer together than a Farsi character and another in Hindi. To give an example of how this works, if we take the nonsense phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;يذؽ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an uncompressed format, that would be stored as the three characters &lt;code&gt;[1610, 1584, 1597]&lt;/code&gt; (based on their Unicode code points). To compress this we first sort it numerically (keeping track of where the original characters were): &lt;code&gt;[1584, 1597, 1610]&lt;/code&gt;. Then we can store the lowest value (&lt;code&gt;1584&lt;/code&gt;), and the delta between that value and the next character (&lt;code&gt;13&lt;/code&gt;), and again for the following character (&lt;code&gt;23&lt;/code&gt;), which is significantly less to transmit and store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punycode then (very) efficiently encodes those integers into characters allowed in domain names, and inserts an &lt;code&gt;xn--&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning to let consumers know this is an encoded domain. You’ll notice that all the Unicode characters end up together at the end of the domain. They don’t just encode their value, they also encode where they should be inserted into the ASCII portion of the domain. To provide an example, the website 熱狗sales.com becomes &lt;code&gt;xn--sales-r65lm0e.com&lt;/code&gt;. Anytime you type a Unicode-based domain name into your browser’s address bar, it is encoded in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transformation could be transparent, but that introduces a major security problem. All sorts of Unicode characters print identically to existing ASCII characters. For example, you likely can’t see the difference between Cyrillic small letter a (“а”) and Latin small letter a (“a”). If I register Cyrillic аmazon.com (xn--mazon-3ve.com), and manage to trick you into visiting it, it’s gonna be hard to know you’re on the wrong site. For that reason, when you visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://xn--vi8hiv.ws&quot;&gt;🍕💩.ws&lt;/a&gt;, your browser somewhat lamely shows you &lt;code&gt;xn--vi8hiv.ws&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;protocol&quot;&gt;Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first portion of the URL is the protocol which should be used to access it. The most common protocol is &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;, which is the simple document transfer protocol Tim Berners-Lee invented specifically to power the web. It was not the only option. &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0339.html&quot;&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; believed we should just use Gopher. Rather than being general-purpose, Gopher is specifically designed to send structured data similar to how a file tree is structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you request the &lt;code&gt;/Cars&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, it might return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;1Chevy Camaro             /Archives/cars/cc     gopher.cars.com     70
iThe Camero is a classic  fake                  (NULL)              0
iAmerican Muscle car      fake                  (NULL)              0
1Ferrari 451              /Factbook/ferrari/451  gopher.ferrari.net 70
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which identifies two cars, along with some metadata about them and where you can connect to for more information. The understanding was your client would parse this information into a usable form which linked the entries with the destination pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yale.edu/pclt/WINWORLD/GOPHER.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/gopher.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Gopher&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first popular protocol was FTP, which was created in 1971, as a way of listing and downloading files on remote computers. Gopher was a logical extension of this, in that it provided a similar listing, but included facilities for also reading the metadata about entries. This meant it could be used for more liberal purposes like a news feed or a simple database. It did not have, however, the freedom and simplicity which characterizes HTTP and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is a very simple protocol, particularily when compared to alternatives like FTP or even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/&quot;&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/a&gt; protocol which is rising in popularity today. First off, HTTP is entirely text based, rather than being composed of bespoke binary incantations (which would have made it significantly more efficient). Tim Berners-Lee correctly intuited that using a text-based format would make it easier for generations of programmers to develop and debug HTTP-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP also makes almost no assumptions about what you’re transmitting. Despite the fact that it was invented expliticly to accompany the HTML language, it allows you to specify that your content is of any type (using the MIME &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;, which was a new invention at the time). The protocol itself is rather simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-http&quot;&gt;GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might respond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-http&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
        Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.
    &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this in context, you can think of the networking system the Internet uses as starting with IP, the Internet Protocol. IP is responsible for getting a small packet of data (around 1500 bytes) from one computer to another. On top of that we have TCP, which is responsible for taking larger blocks of data like entire documents and files and sending them via many IP packets reliably. On top of that, we then implement a protocol like HTTP or FTP, which specifies what format should be used to make the data we send via TCP (or UDP, etc.) understandable and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, TCP/IP sends a whole bunch of bytes to another computer, the protocol says what those bytes should be and what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make your own protocol if you like, assemblying the bytes in your TCP messages however you like. The only requirement is that whoever you are talking to speaks the same language. For this reason, it’s common to standardize these protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, many less important protocols to play with. For example there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc865.txt&quot;&gt;Quote of The Day&lt;/a&gt; protocol (port 17), and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc864.txt&quot;&gt;Random Characters&lt;/a&gt; protocol (port 19). They may seem silly today, but they also showcase just how important that a general-purpose document transmission format like HTTP was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;port&quot;&gt;Port&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeline of Gopher and HTTP can be evidenced by their default port numbers. Gopher is 70, HTTP 80. The HTTP port was assigned (likely by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel&quot;&gt;Jon Postel&lt;/a&gt; at the IANA) at the request of Tim Berners-Lee sometime between &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1060&quot;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1340&quot;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept, of registering ‘port numbers’ predates even the Internet. In the original NCP protocol which powered the ARPANET remote addresses were identified by 40 bits. The first 32 identified the remote host, similar to how an IP address works today. The last eight were known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc433&quot;&gt;AEN&lt;/a&gt; (it stood for “Another Eight-bit Number”), and were used by the remote machine in the way we use a port number, to separate messages destined for different processes. In other words, the address specifies which machine the message should go to, and the AEN (or port number) tells that remote machine which application should get the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc322&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; that users register these ‘socket numbers’ to limit potential collisions. When port numbers were expanded to 16 bits by TCP/IP, that registration process was continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While protocols have a default port, it makes sense to allow ports to also be specified manually to allow for local development and the hosting of multiple services on the same machine. That same logic was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0335.html&quot;&gt;basis&lt;/a&gt; for prefixing websites with &lt;code&gt;www.&lt;/code&gt;. At the time, it was unlikely anyone was getting access to the root of their domain, just for hosting an ‘experimental’ website. But if you give users the hostname of your specific machine (&lt;code&gt;dx3.cern.ch&lt;/code&gt;), you’re in trouble when you need to replace that machine. By using a common subdomain (&lt;code&gt;www.cern.ch&lt;/code&gt;) you can change what it points to as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thebitinbetween&quot;&gt;The Bit In-between&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, the URL syntax places a double slash (&lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;) between the protocol and the rest of the URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://cloudflare.com
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That double slash was inherited from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo/Domain&quot;&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; computer system which was one of the first networked workstations. The Apollo team had a similar problem to Tim Berners-Lee: they needed a way to separate a path from the machine that path is on. Their solution was to create a special path format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;//computername/file/path/as/usual
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And TBL copied that scheme. Incidentally, he now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc&quot;&gt;regrets&lt;/a&gt; that decision, wishing the domain (in this case &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;) was the first portion of the path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http:com/example/foo/bar/baz
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLs were never intended to be what they’ve become: an arcane way for a user to identify a site on the Web. Unfortunately, we’ve never been able to standardize URNs, which would give us a more useful naming system. Arguing that the current URL system is sufficient is like praising the DOS command line, and stating that most people should simply learn to use command line syntax. The reason we have windowing systems is to make computers easier to use, and more widely used. The same thinking should lead us to a superior way of locating specific sites on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Dale Dougherty &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996JanFeb/0075.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;year&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several different ways to understand the ‘Internet’. One is as a system of computers connected using a computer network. That version of the Internet came into being in 1969 with the creation of the ARPANET. Mail, files and chat all moved over that network before the creation of HTTP, HTML, or the ‘web browser’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992 Tim Berners-Lee created three things, giving birth to what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; consider the Internet. The HTTP protocol, HTML, and the URL. His goal was to bring ‘Hypertext’ to life. Hypertext at its simplest is the ability to create documents which link to one another. At the time it was viewed more as a science fiction panacea, to be complimented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia&quot;&gt;Hypermedia&lt;/a&gt;, and any other word you could add ‘Hyper’ in front of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key requirement of Hypertext was the ability to link from one document to another. In TBL’s time though, these documents were hosted in a multitude of formats and accessed through protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)&quot;&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt; and FTP. He needed a consistent way to refer to a file which encoded its protocol, its host on the Internet, and where it existed on that host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Conferences/IETF92/WWX_BOF_mins.html&quot;&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt; World-Wide Web presentation in March of 1992 TBL described it as a ‘Universal Document Identifier’ (UDI). Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/old/osi-ds-29-00.txt&quot;&gt;different formats&lt;/a&gt; were considered for this identifier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;protocol: aftp host: xxx.yyy.edu path: /pub/doc/README
 
PR=aftp; H=xx.yy.edu; PA=/pub/doc/README;
 
PR:aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README
 
/aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document also explains why spaces must be encoded in URLs (%20):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of white space characters has been avoided in UDIs: spaces &amp;gt; are not legal characters. This was done because of the frequent &amp;gt; introduction of extraneous white space when lines are wrapped by &amp;gt; systems such as mail, or sheer necessity of narrow column width, and &amp;gt; because of the inter-conversion of various forms of white space &amp;gt; which occurs during character code conversion and the transfer of &amp;gt; text between applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s most important to understand is that the URL was fundamentally just an abbreviated way of refering to the combination of scheme, domain, port, credentials and path which previously had to be understood contextually for each different communication system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first officially defined in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt&quot;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt; published in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system made it possible to refer to different systems from within Hypertext, but now that virtually all content is hosted over HTTP, may not be as necessary anymore. As early as &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996JanFeb/0075.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt; browsers were already inserting the &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;www.&lt;/code&gt; for users automatically (rendering any advertisement which still contains them truly ridiculous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think the question is whether people can learn the meaning of the URL, I just find it it morally abhorrent to force grandma or grandpa to understand what, in the end, are UNIX file system conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slash separated path component of a URL should be familiar to any user of any computer built in the last fifty years. The hierarchal filesystem itself was introduced by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multicians.org/&quot;&gt;MULTICS&lt;/a&gt; system. Its creator, in turn, attributes it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/&quot;&gt;a two hour conversation with Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt; he had in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MULTICS used the greater than symbol (&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to separated file path components. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;usr&amp;gt;bin&amp;gt;local&amp;gt;awk
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was perfectly logical, but unfortunately the Unix folks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to represent redirection, delegating path separation to the forward slash (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a person I reserve the right to use different criteria for different purposes. I want to be able to give names to generic works, AND to particular translations AND to particular versions. I want a richer world than you propose. I don’t want to be constrained by your two-level system of “documents” and “variants”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Tim Berners-Lee &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/1003.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;year&quot;&gt;1993&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;amp;aid=9282809&amp;amp;fileId=S1472669614000255&quot;&gt;One half&lt;/a&gt; of the URLs referenced by US Supreme Court opinions point to pages which no longer exist. If you were reading an academic paper in 2011, written in 2001, you have better than even odds that any given URL won’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-S14-S5&quot;&gt;be valid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0234.html&quot;&gt;a fervent belief&lt;/a&gt; in 1993 that the URL would die, in favor of the ‘URN’. The Uniform Resource Name is a permanent reference to a given piece of content which, unlike a URL, will never change or break. Tim Berners-Lee first described the “urgent need” for them as early as &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1991/0018.html&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to craft a URN might be to simply use a cryptographic hash of the contents of the page, for example: &lt;code&gt;urn:791f0de3cfffc6ec7a0aacda2b147839&lt;/code&gt;. This method doesn’t meet the criteria of the web community though, as it wasn’t really possible to figure out who to ask to turn that hash into a piece of real content. It also didn’t account for the format changes which often happen to files (compressed vs uncompressed for example) which nevertheless represent the same content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/10/12859_2013_Article_6083_Fig2_HTML.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reliability of URLs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996 Keith Shafer and several others proposed a solution to the problem of broken URLs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://purl.oclc.org/OCLC/PURL/INET96&quot;&gt;The link&lt;/a&gt; to this solution is now broken. Roy Fielding posted an implementation suggestion in July of 1995. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-ietf-uri-roy-urn-urc-00.txt&quot;&gt;That link&lt;/a&gt; is now broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find these pages through Google, which has functionally made page titles the URN of today. The URN format was ultimately finalized in 1997, and has essentially never been used since. The implementation is itself interesting. Each URN is composed of two components, an &lt;code&gt;authority&lt;/code&gt; who can resolve a given type of URN, and the specific ID of this document in whichever format the &lt;code&gt;authority&lt;/code&gt; understands. For example, &lt;code&gt;urn:isbn:0131103628&lt;/code&gt; will identify a book, forming a permanent link which can (hopefully) be turned into a set of URLs by your local &lt;code&gt;isbn&lt;/code&gt; resolver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the power of search engines, it’s possible the best URN format today would be a simple way for files to point to their former URLs. We could allow the search engines to index this information, and link us as appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- On http://zack.is/history --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;past-url&quot; href=&quot;http://zackbloom.com/history.html&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;past-url&quot; href=&quot;http://zack.is/history.html&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.5360824742268&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; format is in many ways an aberrant monstrosity, the result of many years of implementation accidents and compromises leading to a set of requirements necessary for interoperability, but in no way representing good design practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.spec.whatwg.org#application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;&gt;WhatWG URL Spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used the web for any period of time, you are familiar with query parameters. They follow the path portion of the URL, and encode options like &lt;code&gt;?name=zack&amp;amp;state=mi&lt;/code&gt;. It may seem odd to you that queries use the ampersand character (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) which is the same character used in HTML to encode special characters. In fact, if you’ve used HTML for any period of time, you likely have had to encode ampersands in URLs, turning &lt;code&gt;http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;y=2&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;amp;y=2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://host?x=1&amp;amp;#38;y=2&lt;/code&gt; (that particular confusion has &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0447.html&quot;&gt;always existed&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have also noticed that cookies follow a similar, but different format: &lt;code&gt;x=1;y=2&lt;/code&gt; which doesn’t actually conflict with HTML character encoding at all. This idea was not lost on the W3C, who encouraged implementers to support &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; in query parameters as early as &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-8.2.1&quot;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, this section of the URL was strictly used for searching ‘indexes’. The Web was originally created (and its funding was based on it creating) a method of collaboration for high energy physicists. This is not to say Tim Berners-Lee didn’t know he was really creating a general-purpose communication tool. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0286.html&quot;&gt;didn’t add support&lt;/a&gt; for tables for years, which is probably something physicists would have needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, these ‘physicists’ needed a way of encoding and linking to information, and a way of searching that information. To provide that, Tim Berners-Lee created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/isindex&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ISINDEX&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag. If &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ISINDEX&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; appeared on a page, it would inform the browser that this is a page which can be searched. The browser should show a search field, and allow the user to send a query to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Search.html&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; was formatted as keywords separated by plus characters (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://cernvm/FIND/?sgml+cms
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fantastic Internet fashion, this tag was quickly abused to do all manner of things including providing an input to calculate square roots. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0042.html&quot;&gt;quickly proposed&lt;/a&gt; that perhaps this was too specific, and we really needed a general purpose &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That particular proposal actually uses plus signs to separate the components of what otherwise looks like a modern GET query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://somehost.somewhere/some/path?x=xxxx+y=yyyy+z=zzzz
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was far from universally acclaimed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0032.html&quot;&gt;Some believed&lt;/a&gt; we needed a way of saying that the content on the other side of links should be searchable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a HREF=&quot;wais://quake.think.com/INFO&quot; INDEX=1&amp;gt;search&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0044.html&quot;&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; we should have a way of defining strongly-typed queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ISINDEX TYPE=&quot;iana:/www/classes/query/personalinfo&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can be somewhat confident in saying, in retrospect, I am glad the more generic solution won out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real work on &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;INPUT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0079.html&quot;&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; in January of 1993 based on an older SGML type. It was (perhaps unfortunately), &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0085.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SELECT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; inputs needed a separate, richer, structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;select name=FIELDNAME type=CHOICETYPE [value=VALUE] [help=HELPUDI]&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;choice&amp;gt;item 1
    &amp;lt;choice&amp;gt;item 2
    &amp;lt;choice&amp;gt;item 3
&amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, reusing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, rather than introducing the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element was &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html&quot;&gt;absolutely&lt;/a&gt; considered. There were, of course, alternative form proposals. &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0168.html&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; included some variable substituion evocative of what Angular might do today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ENTRYBLANK TYPE=int LENGTH=length DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&amp;gt;Prompt&amp;lt;/ENTRYBLANK&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;QUESTION TYPE=float DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&amp;gt;Prompt&amp;lt;/QUESTION&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;CHOICE DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=value1&amp;gt;Prompt1 ...
    &amp;lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=valuen&amp;gt;Promptn
&amp;lt;/CHOICE&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example the inputs are checked against the type specified in &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;VAR&lt;/code&gt; values are available on the page for use in &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0150.html&quot;&gt;string substitution&lt;/a&gt; in URLs, à la:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://cloudflare.com/apps/$appId
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; actually used &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, rather than &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, to separate query components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3f515e525a7f495e534a5a&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e35707f737b5e&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;(value&amp;amp;value)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Marc Andreessen who &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0812.html&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; our current method based on what he had already implemented in Mosaic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;name=value&amp;amp;name=value&amp;amp;name=value
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0437.html&quot;&gt;two months later&lt;/a&gt; Mosaic would add support for &lt;code&gt;method=POST&lt;/code&gt; forms, and ‘modern’ HTML forms were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it was also Marc Andreessen’s company &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19990421025406/http://home.mcom.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt; who would create the cookie format (using a different separator). Their proposal was itself painfully shortsighted, led to the attempt to introduce a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set-Cookie2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; header, and introduced fundamental structural issues we still deal with at Cloudflare to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fragments&quot;&gt;Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion of the URL following the ‘#’ is known as the fragment. Fragments were a part of URLs since their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html&quot;&gt;initial specification&lt;/a&gt;, used to link to a specific location on the page being loaded. For example, if I have an anchor on my site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a name=&quot;bio&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can link to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://zack.is/#bio
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept was gradually extended to any element (rather than just anchors), and moved to the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute rather than &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1 id=&quot;bio&quot;&amp;gt;Bio&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee decided to use this character based on its connection to addresses in the United States (despite the fact that he’s British by birth). In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc&quot;&gt;his words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a snail mail address in the US at least, it is common to use the number sign for an apartment number or suite number within a building. So 12 Acacia Av #12 means “The building at 12 Acacia Av, and then within that the unit known numbered 12”. It seemed to be a natural character for the task. Now, http://www.example.com/foo#bar means “Within resource http://www.example.com/foo, the particular view of it known as bar”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)&quot;&gt;original Hypertext system&lt;/a&gt;, created by Douglas Englebart, also used the ‘#’ character for the same purpose. This may be coincidental or it could be a case of accidental “idea borrowing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragments are explicitly not included in HTTP requests, meaning they only live inside the browser. This concept proved very valuable when it came time to implement client-side navigation (before &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API&quot;&gt;pushState&lt;/a&gt; was introduced). Fragments were also very valuable when it came time to think about how we can store state in URLs without actually sending it to the server. What could that mean? Let’s explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;molehillsandmountains&quot;&gt;Molehills and Mountains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.8301886792453&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole standard, as yukky as SGML, on Electronic data Intercahnge [sic], meaning forms and form submission. I know no more except it looks like fortran backwards with no spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Tim Berners-Lee &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0091.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1993&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a popular perception that the internet standards bodies didn’t do much from the finalization of HTTP 1.1 and HTML 4.01 in 2002 to when HTML 5 really got on track. This period is also known (only by me) as the Dark Age of XHTML. The truth is though, the standardization folks were &lt;em&gt;fantastically busy&lt;/em&gt;. They were just doing things which ultimately didn’t prove all that valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such effort was the Semantic Web. The dream was to create a Resource Description Framework (editorial note: run away from any team which seeks to create a framework), which would allow metadata about content to be universally expressed. For example, rather than creating a nice web page about my Corvette Stingray, I could make an RDF document describing its size, color, and the number of speeding tickets I had gotten while driving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, in no way a bad idea. But the format was XML based, and there was a big chicken-and-egg problem between having the entire world documented, and having the browsers do anything useful with that documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did however provide a powerful environment for philosophical argument. One of the best such arguments lasted at least ten years, and was known by the masterful codename ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14&quot;&gt;httpRange-14&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;httpRange-14 sought to answer the fundamental question of what a URL is. Does a URL always refer to a document, or can it refer to anything? Can I have a URL which points to my car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t attempt to answer that question in any satisfying manner. Instead they focused on how and when we can use 303 redirects to point users from links which aren’t documents to ones which are, and when we can use URL fragments (the bit after the ‘#’) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.iandavis.com/2010/11/a-guide-to-publishing-linked-data-without-redirects/&quot;&gt;point users to linked data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the pragmatic mind of today, this might seem like a silly question. To many of us, you can use a URL for whatever you manage to use it for, and people will use your thing or they won’t. But the Semantic Web cares for nothing more than semantics, so it was on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular topic was discussed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/01-tag-summary#arch-doc&quot;&gt;July 1st 2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/15-tag-summary#L3330&quot;&gt;July 15th 2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/22-tag-summary#L3974&quot;&gt;July 22nd 2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/29-tag-summary#httpRange-14&quot;&gt;July 29th 2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0127&quot;&gt;September 16th 2002&lt;/a&gt;, and at least 20 other occasions through 2005. It was resolved by the great ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html&quot;&gt;httpRange-14 resolution&lt;/a&gt;’ of 2005, then reopened by complaints in &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2007Jul/0034.html&quot;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-awwsw/2011Jan/0021.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/uddp/change-proposal-call.html&quot;&gt;a call for new solutions&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The question was heavily discussed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/pedantic-web/httprange-14/pedantic-web/iLY6VFvN-H0/SXQwc-lOpM8J&quot;&gt;pedantic web&lt;/a&gt; group, which is very aptly named. The one thing which didn’t happen is all that much semantic data getting put on the web behind any sort of URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;auth&quot;&gt;Auth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, you can include a username and password in URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://zack:&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f2c3737373737371f253e3c3471362c&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser then encodes this authentication data into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64&quot;&gt;Base64&lt;/a&gt;, and sends it as a header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Authentication: Basic emFjazpzaGhoaGho
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason for the Base64 encoding is to allow characters which might not be valid in a header, it provides no obscurity to the username and password values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularily over the pre-SSL internet, this was very problematic. Anyone who could snoop on your connection could easily see your password. &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0297.html&quot;&gt;Many alternatives&lt;/a&gt; were proposed including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)&quot;&gt;Kerberos&lt;/a&gt; which is a widely used security protocol both then and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many of these examples though, the simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0882.html&quot;&gt;basic auth proposal&lt;/a&gt; was easiest for browser manufacturers (Mosaic) to implement. This made it the first, and ultimately the only, solution until developers were given the tools to build their own authentication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thewebapplication&quot;&gt;The Web Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis for the web being the hyperlink. It is a method of linking one document to another, which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions, authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create. Ultimately, the conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all that matters is adoption. If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it might be, they will help you craft it into what they need. The corollary is, of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might be. There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which precisely no one uses today.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Man built a bunker under Hampstead Heath and lived in it for two years</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ost nights, before bed, before it all went wrong, Dominic Van Allen whiled away the last of the evening hours in a pub called The Garden Gate. It was easy to fit in and feel smart there, chatting and drinking with a crowd who passed through in varied states of dishevelment. Dog-walkers brought in sodden dogs. Exhausted junior doctors shambled in after shifts with their sleeves pushed up. There were scarved and suited older men, frail as antique hatstands, and casually dressed professionals with jobs in finance or entertainment who owned expensive homes nearby. “And it’s you rich buggers,” Van Allen marvelled, genially enough, as he eyed the state of their trainers, “who can afford to look the scruffiest.” He wore durable boots, khaki trousers and a leather motorcycle jacket, and could have been mistaken for a bike courier, a builder, maybe a maintenance guy at the hospital next door, where he was known in the staff canteen as someone who would wander in at dawn to buy a discount coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That winter of 2017, Van Allen was 44 years old – tall, with close-cropped blond hair, blue eyes and a faint Yorkshire accent. At the pub, his was an ale. As soon as he judged it was late enough, Van Allen drank up and said his goodnights, bearing north from the pub and walking up a tree-lined road that hugged one side of Hampstead Heath. A vast open space that sits as a sort of green beehive haircut on top of metropolitan central London, the heath is untamed in parts and otherwise mown and managed like any public park. Every day, people visit by the thousand: runners, outdoor swimmers, tourists, bird-lovers on the trail of whitethroats and blackcaps in the bushes or goldfinches and kestrels in the trees. Sometimes a travelling circus unfolds itself on the hard-packed sand of the heath’s carpark. Summer brings sunbathers, picnickers and sixth-formers sat in circles, while in winter, on those rare occasions it snows, people drag in toboggans. On this night, in December 2017, forecasters had predicted flurries overnight. Van Allen moved briskly, eager to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked up the heath’s western edge, beside a fringe of scrub where hogweed grew in tangles and brambles rose taller than him. It was known that homeless people sometimes slept rough in this scrub, pitching tents here after dark. Van Allen had done this, too, once upon a time. As a rule, he kept the fact of his homelessness to himself, “because, wouldn’t you?” He knew there were a lot of people just like him, irregularly employed, regulars in pubs, the owners of passports and phones and all the right charger leads, only with nowhere stable to live. He would never plausibly make London rent. Social housing was just out of reach. A mortgage purest fantasy. Van Allen had taught himself, instead, how to borrow a piece of this expensive city, night by night, on unarranged loan. When he reached a row of mansion houses that overlooked the heath, he turned off the road and on to a footpath that cut through the scrub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of Van Allen’s story are extraordinary. Others are nowhere near extraordinary enough. There has never been an accurate count of people like him, the visible-invisible homeless. Although we know there are between 55,000 and 60,000 statutory homeless (that is, those who apply to make use of state services) and although there are efforts towards an annual census of rough sleepers (carried out by head-counters who hit the roads every autumn to ask for a show of hands), there’s a vast population the statisticians cannot account for. “You could be sat next to someone,” Van Allen would say, “and not know it. Chances are the barman who served you tonight is one, sleeping in a shelter, sleeping in a squat, sofa-surfing, spending nights in a car or a van.” Van Allen would say: broaden the definition of homeless to factor those in accommodation so precarious it could be taken away in a month, a week, a snap? That’s millions. Charities regularly try to draw attention to the complicated problem of hidden homelessness, a world of concealed partitions, crowded mattresses, beds-in-sheds, the back seats of nightbuses. It’s a legally grey world – everything that goes on between a fixed address and “the shopping-trolley stage”, as Van Allen would later put it, when he was arrested and interviewed by police. A world of “just-find-somewhere, just-stay-out-the-way”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway along the footpath, he turned off again, this time stepping directly into dense bramble. He found a narrow gulley that had been cut between the thorns and followed it through a zigzag turn to a small clearing, where he bent in the dark and patted the earthy floor. There – a concealed hatch. Van Allen tugged it open with his fingers and descended into the ground, closing the hatch behind. Below, he flicked on lights at a switch. He hung up his coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command, lead interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: “This might seem a silly question. But what was the camp for?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominic Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “Housing. Nowhere to live.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTC&lt;/strong&gt;: “[…] You made it permanent by going underground, by digging … What year?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “They bulldozered it, when, February 2018? So it was [two years before that], spring 2016. The last of the thaw just coming in … We just decided, sod it. Why not?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;here was space in the bunker for two camp beds, pushed against opposite walls. In the 4ft gulley between the beds, Van Allen could stand, comfortably enough, without his head scraping the trussed timber roof. The floor underneath him was poured concrete. He’d put up hooks for his coat, his bag and his cooking utensils, and there were shelves by the bed for odds and ends. Push-button LED lights were stuck to the walls using tape. There was a portable gas stove down here, and now that Van Allen was in for the night, he lit it and emptied a can of soup into a pan. After eating, he washed up with wet wipes. Litter was tied inside plastic bags, to be spirited away to a distant bin, early tomorrow, before the heath’s park rangers came on duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, Van Allen slept well. Beyond the timber walls there was more concrete, to keep out groundwater, and together with the Hampstead clay, this muffled all but the most extreme-frequency sounds. (On fireworks night he heard the bangs, but not the crackles.) When he first moved down here, Van Allen worried about oversleeping and he sometimes set a morning alarm on his phone. It was never needed. He was decades-trained to be up and on the move before the city’s day shift began, before London became more closely observed by its security guards and park rangers and police officers, any one of whom might inadvertently happen on the latest of his impermanent shelters and blow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even by his own standards (and Van Allen had a rich history of securing guerrilla accommodation), the bunker was outrageous. He knew its eventual discovery was inevitable. He also knew that, as long as they observed small precautions, this outcome could be deferred for improbable lengths of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. No giveaway litter. No lingering near the hatch during daylight hours. And no boasting, not at The Garden Gate, not while fulfilling handyman jobs around town. Liked by his friends for his graveyard sense of humour, Van Allen told them he’d built a ranch. What he did not say was that the ranch was 14ft by 10ft, about the size of a generous disabled loo, and hidden under one of the country’s busiest public parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That December, when he woke in the morning and popped his head out, he saw the forecasters had been right, and that several inches of snow had settled on the bunker’s roof overnight. Insulated by concrete and clay, Van Allen had stayed warm enough to sleep in a T-shirt; satisfied, as he tended to be, by the minor technical triumphs, he padded away in the direction of the hospital to get a coffee in the canteen. He left bootprints behind, but very soon the tobogganers would be out, mushing up the snow, whizzing down the slope just a few feet from his hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “Tell me about yourself, Dominic.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “In what respect … ?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTC&lt;/strong&gt;: “Just your history, basically.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “I’ve been homeless for 26 years. I don’t know, I used to be stage crew. I developed some sort of bone disease … ”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTC&lt;/strong&gt;: “That was the end of that career?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “That was the end of it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;e was born in 1973, up Wakefield way, and gone by 21, drifting south to London and a flatshare in Pimlico. He worked as a barman, a painter and decorator, a labourer and an airport cargo driver before he found a job he liked, as stage crew. On the books of a production company, Van Allen worked mostly on music concerts and outdoor TV broadcasts, a dependable “scaff monkey”, so-called because he would willingly cast aside his smoke and steeplejack up a teetering scaffold, to rig a speaker or aim a spotlight. He put up fencing for U2 in Hyde Park, and once pulled an all-nighter there, building out the backstage area for Live 8. He did jobs for Channel 4, L’Oréal, the Proms. Crewing suited Van Allen’s lifestyle in that it took place behind the scenes, went on late and often meant modifying city spaces to suit the specific needs of a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had abandoned the Pimlico flatshare when it got too expensive, taking up squatting instead. For a decade, he shifted between council-owned sites around London, until 2011, when the laws governing squatting got stricter, sites became scarcer and ever-sharper elbows were needed to secure a berth. Van Allen’s health was bad. He’d been working on a broadcast for terrestrial TV, carrying production equipment on a roof, when he stepped awkwardly and broke a leg. Still on crutches, he broke the other leg, which scared him. Doctors diagnosed a bone condition and warned that the spontaneous fractures might continue without rest. The crew work had to stop, and Van Allen could no longer keep up with the hardscrabble competition to secure and defend a place in the squats. He spent a while moving between authorities, trying to make the case that (his words) he was fucked. Hospitals referred him to councils, or councils referred him to housing trusts. There were applications to Camden and Hammersmith and Fulham local authorities, the Peabody trust, the Guinness Partnership. There were queues. Forms. Means tests and medical evaluations that could feel as if they were made at a glance. There were bad days, in waiting rooms, when he lost his patience and argued with the stressed employees behind their protective glass. Van Allen wasn’t especially young or old, wasn’t an addict, wasn’t a parent. There were so many others (my words) &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fucked. He never quite reached the top of anybody’s list, and was eventually told: “It’s unlikely you’ll get housed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get him started on the subject, ale in hand at The Garden Gate, or on those rare occasions he called in to correct a glib host on talk radio, and Van Allen could &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re an island of, what, 96,000 sq miles? Population that’s sky-high, growing, and the same number of houses we had 40 years ago. Too many people! Not enough houses! Me and most of my friends, we’re all in the same boat, long-termers, a community hundreds of thousands strong, not crashed in the gutter, people in paid employment, and all fucked – have been for years. It’s the way the legislation is … We didn’t choose this friggin’ path. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt; Act of 1996 and every bullshit piece of legislation that’s been put in place since. &lt;em&gt;It’s not our path&lt;/em&gt;. I fought it for years and then I threw in the towel. Said to myself: ‘Fuck it, I’m going camping.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration for long read 5th March&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88602c467f773bef44d7d34347617f9d7c0500af/0_1055_3190_621/master/3190.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=920854f9f85175f85c05afc01cedeb81&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had a few thousand put away in the bank, and he could still take on handyman work, putting up shelves and assembling flatpack furniture for £20 or £30 a gig, often arranging these one-off jobs through an app on his phone. Knocked, tired, but still with a Crusoe spirit that never really left him, Van Allen bought good boots and a good tent and moved his life outdoors. Like a lot of people who drift into homelessness, the knack came piecemeal. Van Allen shaved his hair to a grade one, for easy cleaning with soap. He got to know which swimming pools had the cheapest one-off entry fees for showering; which drop-in centres let you use their address for post. He bought underwear and T-shirts in bulk, cheaply, online, so that these could be discarded if necessary – “crash and trash”, he called this. He became a regular at a Catholic church where they cooked a daily breakfast for the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any possessions that did not fit in his 15-litre rucksack were understood to be temporary. Stuff got stolen, confiscated, trashed, so Van Allen learned to keep reserves of essentials, especially tents. He had these stashed under bushes and on rooftops everywhere from Camden in the north to Stratford in the east, Southwark below the river to Richmond out west. Should weather prohibit camping, he kept on his keyring a certain type of skeleton key, meant for use by the fire brigade, that could open emergency-access doors. He became a confident navigator of a second, shadow London, favouring places where other people weren’t: boiler rooms, back staircases, parks after dark, the tops of tower blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good-weather months he camped on the heath, becoming familiar with the park’s night-time rhythms – first the hour the rangers knocked off, then the last of the dog-walkers, and, after that, the twilight time when the homeless presided, gathering on benches to share a beer or a spliff before they bedded down and ceded the place to the magpies and moles. There could be an absolute stillness on the heath at one or two in the morning – a stillness shredded, more than once in Van Allen’s experience, by the arrival of joyriders, convening to gun their cars over the empty grass before disappearing as suddenly as they’d come. A twin-rotor helicopter, military, he guessed, often flew over around 5am, signal it would soon be time for him to rise and break down his tent, hiding it before the rangers arrived. After years of this, Van Allen wondered about something more permanent. In the language of the circuit, securing somewhere to spend the night was “parking up”. What if he parked down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “Tell me what you know about this area of Hampstead Heath.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “I’ve been there for about seven years … Sounds stupid, dig a friggin’ bunker … [but] I’m getting too old for breaking tents apart and shoving them under bushes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;or centuries, would-be colonists have tried to annex a piece of the heath for themselves. People in flight from plague camped here in the 17th century, as did gospellers, passing travellers and highwaymen (some of whom hanged here, too). In the 1830s, an excitable lord, licking his lips on a neighbouring estate, tried to enclose a chunk of heath for his private use. He was thwarted by the courts, and the brazenness of that attempt helped bring Hampstead Heath into public ownership in 1879. Animals have always come and gone, medieval wolves, later Keats’ nightingale, later still a rare wallaby, spotted bounding through the trees in spring 2019. Gardeners were permitted to dig allotments here during the first world war, and in the second, the fields and summits were commandeered for booming anti-aircraft guns. Probably the heath’s most discreet settlers – at least til Van Allen came along with a shovel, a sack of cement and a Makita power saw – have been the beetles, long-term masters of the gnarled wooden fenceposts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Allen did not immediately go for his moonshot, his bunker, and in the months before he roughed out a rectangle and broke ground, he prepared with practice digs, equipment tests and other subterranean schemes of milder ambition. Between 2013 and 2015, working with an accomplice, Van Allen dug a series of holes across the heath. Each hole was the exact size of a wheelie bin – because that’s what they were for, the bins buried upright and with their lids still accessible, making them ideal for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accomplice in this work was a Polish labourer, then in his mid-30s, called Marek Wójcik. (His name has been altered in this story. The Guardian has been unable to contact him to learn his version of events.) According to Van Allen, Wójcik was informally employed as a labourer on building sites around London. He knew carpentry, masonry and how to lay foundations, skills that meshed well with Van Allen’s own improvisational bravado, learned from years of hurry-up work as stage crew. Over beers on a bench, the two men had been discussing an ambitious dig. What do you think, Van Allen asked Wójcik. Start tonight? The park’s night patrol had trundled by, distantly, along its normal predictable route. They wouldn’t be back for hours. “Sod it,” Van Allen said, “why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site he’d prepared was in the same fringe of scrub that had concealed campers forever, only better hidden. He had hacked into a huge, wickedly thorned blackberry bush, hollowing out the interior using bolt-cutters. The site was close to a cluster of their underground storage bins, which was helpful because the bins now contained a garden-shed miscellany of tools and materials: supplies of cement powder, fertiliser and caustic soda; a cordless drill and a power saw; two spades. Van Allen and Wójcik got into a nightly routine, waiting till about midnight, downing an energising beer, and digging for an hour or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been hell, when they were burying the wheelie bins, to hack through tree roots. Now they mixed a solution of caustic soda and soaked the ground with it, to soften whatever grew under there. Stones had to be clawed out by hand. Whenever it rained between their nightly digs, the pair would return and spend ages scooping out the wet clay, which both slowed the work and had the effect of making the emerging bunker much bigger than they’d meant. As the shovelled-up ground formed a doughnut shape inside the bush, Van Allen worried the site might be spotted from overhead. Drone enthusiast? The satellites that supplied images to Google Earth? He paused the work, just in case, and bought a camouflage net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All very Great Escape, Van Allen thought, once they were about 6ft down and deep enough to start installing timber struts. The bunker would need a lot of wood. He later insisted this came from fallen tree branches. When they were ready to reinforce the walls and pour the floor, Van Allen trundled a wheelie bin in the dark over to one of the heath’s bathing ponds. (One-part water.) He trundled over to the sandy carpark. (One-part sand.) Mixed with four-parts cement powder, this was their concrete. Timber slats formed the roof, which was fitted with insulation foam and a flush, hinged hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they waited for the concrete to set and harden, Van Allen embarked on a programme of tactical horticulture. He uprooted hawthorn bushes, whole, and replanted them around the clearing as fortification. Should anyone blunder through, despite this, he set about rewilding, spreading compost everywhere, encouraging the bramble to grow where it liked. Flat squares of chicken wire, salvaged from thrown-away barbecues and sprinkled with fertiliser and seed, allowed grass to grow over the bunker roof. Soon there was no need for the camo net and it was hard to tell, unless it had been your idea in the first place, where the ancient heath ended and the new plot began. Van Allen had budgeted £100 for the job, and come in under. It had taken about two months. Without ceremony, one night, they moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “Any wildlife killed?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “No … We’re not Australians … I’m not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;rustic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTC&lt;/strong&gt;: “OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. What I’m getting at is, there was a firearm inside your campsite.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “We’re not knocking off the wildlife … There’s a Marks &amp;amp; Spencer down the road.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ome rules for bunker life, 2016-18. If you were in at night, no crackling around in the undergrowth for a wee. Van Allen kept an empty juice bottle by his bed for this reason. (The Innocent brand was best. Wide neck.) If you wanted a hot meal, you reheated soup in the bunker, sometimes pre-made mashed potato, or the milder Thai curries that M&amp;amp;S sold; but no smellier foods, nothing that might lure a curious animal into the clearing. “Behind every dog” went another of Van Allen’s rules, “there’s an owner. And Fido can be worse for you than the neighbourhood watch.” Foxes were different. When the same fox started to come creeping through the clearing, Van Allen knew it meant the heath had largely emptied of people, and he could relax. He became fond of the animal, and sometimes bought it pet food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had never identified, much, with the downcast-in-a-doorway image that some of the charities pushed. He was homeless but he had a travelcard, a bike locked near the hospital, a bank account. The bunker afforded other aspects of everyday normality – the camp bed, shelves for things, a place to listen to the radio aloud, a place to shave his head. When I first heard Van Allen had built a bunker, and under a park that is visited by some 9 million people every year, I wondered why he would choose a spot so close to the heath’s edge, a few strides from the road and the mansion houses. Was it provocation? A statement? Later, when everything had gone wrong, Van Allen gave a more prosaic reason, one that estate agents would instinctively understand. Better transport links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Erno Goldfinger wanted to build a concrete block of flats in this same desirable location. The famed architect proposed a huge grey angular block that was ultimately objected-to by sceptical neighbours. (Those against the scheme included the writer Ian Fleming, then at work on his spy books and in a position to blight Goldfinger’s name forever by borrowing it for a Bond baddie.) Further up the hill, in 2017, a woman bought a piece of heath-side land and built a pretty wooden cottage on it. Again, permission was debated and this time neighbours secured an order for the cottage’s demolition. That year, while Van Allen was underground, his closest neighbours advertised their own place for sale. Six beds. Five floors. A double-wide garage just over the scrub. Offers were invited “in excess of £9m”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the game of property and land rights, there’s an urge to sniff or roll eyes at what goes on – be irritated or even perversely impressed by those who would blow up a woman’s cottage or ask £9m for opening bids on bricks and mortar. The thread through all this stuff starts to look like unblinking nerve, a trying-for-what-you-think-you-can-get-away-with. Van Allen did not doubt that the excavation of his bunker breached park rules. He was aware that what he considered “Womble-ing” would be called vandalism by others, and he accepted the possibility of a fine, maybe a minor charge, as the price of stable shelter. The bunker was him trying something. His show of nerve. By the time of the snow in December 2017, he had been getting away with it longer than he ever realistically expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “[We invited in] a couple of other transients every now and again, but they were rare … Once every few months … People we met who were in a bit of a state … people who were fucked.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “And why … ?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “Because you’ll see them, they’re sat on a bench. And they look lost. It’s 10 o’clock at night and they ain’t got a pot to piss in … [We] just [offer] a cigarette, say: ‘We’re over there, mate.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;e had become a familiar figure to the park rangers, and they would exchange cordial hellos. Van Allen called them “Parky” – all of them. He wondered how suspicious Parky had become. “I was always [there] at dodgy times,” he later told authorities. “And no dog to walk.” The rangers knew and didn’t know. For a long time, rough sleepers on the heath had been ushered on, ideally over borough lines, to become somebody else’s problem. More recently, one ranger told me, a policy of “benign management” had been adopted. This method meant patience, waiting for the right time to deliver a proactive nudge so that the homeless person in their sights moved on in the direction of help, not just another patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the rangers waited til winter to do this, when the scrub became sparser and easier to inspect for camps. Winter was also a time to plunge in to clear up litter and the other unexpected items that got left behind – buggies, shopping trolleys, old munitions, empty bottles of champagne. Over the years, they had discovered bodies on the heath, murder victims and suicides. Still: it came as a surprise, one ranger told me, when they came across a patch where steam was rising out of what ought to have been solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the snow there were days and days of heavy rain. Van Allen was driven out of the bunker by damp and spent some time in a charity shelter near Bloomsbury, waiting for it to dry out. On his return, one night, he clomped through the bramble and saw that a laminated note had been staked near the hatch. Rangers had chosen their moment. In the note, he was encouraged to move on, and perhaps approach his local council or a housing trust for help with accommodation. Reading it, Van Allen thought, wryly: “Yeah. Might try that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recovered a few possessions and moved these to the buried storage bins that were still undisturbed in the scrub close by. He would have to abandon the camp bed; that was annoying. Otherwise, Van Allen was not sentimental, and he left the bunker without another look. Days later a mini-digger tore up the clearing. With the roof picked off, one ranger told me, it was like looking down into the foundations of someone’s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four walls. A roof. Some door off a communal passage or a Banhams-bolted gate at the end of a driveway – or even, some hatch in the mud. These are the fundamentals of a home, and they insulate and shelter, they screen off a little privacy and secure our favourite bits-and-pieces. Home can be a simple matter of demarcation. All that for all of you! This little bit for me. Absent a clear-cut threshold, everything gets complicated and compromised: safety, sanctuary, a sense of rootedness and control, a place in the normal push-and-pull of communal trust. Van Allen had learned long ago that, without any legal partitions or boundary-markers around his hideaways, he could always lose possessions he liked and needed. He did not expect that, one day, he would need to argue the ownership of possessions he wanted nothing to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he had taken the advice in the laminated note, and moved on from the heath, that might have been the end of this phase of Van Allen’s life. He would be somewhere in his shadow city; who knows, maybe he would have landed more formal digs. As it was, he and Wójcik took up camping again, pitching tents in the scrub near their storage bins. Van Allen did not mourn the lost bunker but, through the summer, he may have been demoralised in subtler ways. A new complacency crept in, and the camp started to sprawl. They left out litter (some of Van Allen’s crash-and-trash T-shirts were later found in the bramble) and took more risks. Van Allen and Wójcik got carried away, one weekend in September 2018, and tried to bury an enormous new wheelie bin, without preparing the ground with softening caustic first. It wasn’t a job that could be finished in a night, and with nowhere to hide the bin, they left it halfway out of the ground where it was partially visible from footpaths. A couple of nights later, after his usual beer in The Garden Gate, Van Allen went up the hill after dark and collided with a crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “You must have found a load of my stuff, [my] clothing in the bushes?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;errorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “Yeah.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;here were police vans in the heath car park and uniformed officers had formed a long, snaking cordon that encircled his camp. Later, police would erect blue-and-yellow forensic tents and bring in dogs, plainclothes detectives and investigators wearing boiler suits and hazmat wellies. Van Allen approached the cordon and altered his accent, Hampstead-blend, to ask what was up. He could see there were officers from neighbouring boroughs, far more than would be needed to move along some stubborn homeless people. “You can’t come through here,” Van Allen was told. He retraced his steps, cutting across the darkened heath to the bathing pond, where he found Wójcik on their usual bench. “What’s all this bollocks about?” They agreed it did not look promising. They shared a last beer together. Van Allen had other places he could sleep. A carpeted corner in a public building, lent to him by a sympathetic caretaker. The water-pump room in a tower block. Swapping between these places, through the autumn, he kept thinking about the scale of that crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Allen told a friend, a man named Keong Lim, that he couldn’t make sense of it. All those police for a few buried wheelie bins? His spade and discarded T-shirts? Lim worked in the Catholic church where they cooked the free breakfasts. He liked Van Allen, and was grateful to him for fixing odds and ends around the church. One day, Lim recalled, Van Allen asked for help in finding out more about what had happened on the heath. They searched for it online and found a story in the local newspaper, the Hampstead &amp;amp; Highgate Express, that had been followed up by reporters at the Sun, the Mirror and the Evening Standard. A “Breaking Bad-style makeshift crystal meth lab” had been discovered on the heath, they read. “Wooded area … Containers found … Cordons put in place.” Van Allen turned to Lim and said: “Fucking hell. This is about &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wondered if they had found his reserves of white, granular caustic soda and mistaken it for something more sinister. News outlets as far away as the US and Australia had run the story of the Hampstead meth lab, usually illustrating coverage with a picture of the actor Bryan Cranston as chemist-turned-kingpin Walter White. Van Allen hadn’t seen Breaking Bad. He was more of a BBC Parliament man, believing, with some justification, that life was weird enough without bringing in fiction, but he got the idea. He decided to lie low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2019, he was contacted by police. While picking over the camp, investigators had found a padded envelope in the scrub. It came from a building-supplies company that Van Allen sometimes shopped with online. The old envelope had both his name on it and the address of a drop-in centre he used for post. Investigators had traced his number and now they told Van Allen they wanted to chat to him about the makeshift camp. Genuinely curious, Van Allen asked: “What took you so long?” Months had passed. He hadn’t been back to the heath since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Allen didn’t know it, but the investigation had altered since those fanciful stories about a drugs lab appeared in the papers. While digging up the camp, police had found an improvised weapon, a handmade pipe gun, about the size and shape of a bicycle pump, that was shallowly buried near one of his storage bins. Through a series of steep escalations, the case had passed to officers from counter-terrorism command. Van Allen was told he wasn’t in any trouble himself; but would he meet to talk? He suggested a McDonald’s not far from the heath, expecting the matter would be easily cleared up, 20 minutes, tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;command&lt;/strong&gt;: “So obviously, we met you today at McDonald’s … And when you started talking about the hides, the things dug into the ground … that’s when we decided to start arresting you, OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “Mm-hm.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CTC&lt;/strong&gt;: “We just wanted to give you the opportunity to talk to us on tape about the situation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: “Mm-hm.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;e was arrested and taken for interview at Colindale police station, where he spoke at length about the camp in the scrub. Unimpressed by an officer’s drawing of a site he had colonised and modified with care (“This is a terrible sketch,” he told police), Van Allen borrowed a pencil and made improvements. When it came to questions about the handmade pipe gun, Van Allen issued a “flat denial”, as interviewing officers recorded in their notes. He told them: “I’ve been on that site for seven years and I didn’t put it there. It’s nothing to do with me.” Later he was told that small traces of his DNA had been found on the weapon. Van Allen was advised by his solicitor to stop talking, at least not in his usual freewheeling style. Instead, he issued a second, written denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Allen’s trial for possession of a firearm took place at Blackfriars crown court in summer 2019. His legal team thought the three-day trial had gone quite well, all things considered. The prosecution’s own expert witness, a DNA specialist, had acknowledged there was no way of knowing if Van Allen’s DNA was on the firearm by primary or secondary transfer – that is, whether he had ever physically touched it. Van Allen’s barrister had told the jury about another possible suspect, and insisted they could not rule out the possibility that Van Allen’s strewn clothing had been used to wipe down the weapon before it was buried by somebody else. Even so, when they were sent out to deliberate, the jury decided on a guilty verdict. The judge sentenced Van Allen to five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was moved from HMP Pentonville to HMP Thameside, another concrete box. He would not accept that his new situation, formally sheltered at least, was improved from a state of homelessness. Freedom was freedom, wherever you kipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after Van Allen was sentenced, I started to take frequent walks out of The Garden Gate pub, up the road that bordered the heath, into scrub. It took a few attempts, picking through bramble studded with cans and go-fetch balls, but, finally, there it was: a bleached lesion in the undergrowth, all that remained of the old ranch. Piles of branches had been put down by rangers to cover the holes where the storage bins were. On one visit, a rat the size of a running shoe scuttered across the clearing. Midges churned about, disturbed by my presence. I had a deeper sense that I was trespassing; afterwards, a ranger said that, since Van Allen left, another homeless person had claimed the patch. The ranger was red-cheeked, having spent the morning cutting back bramble that was creeping on to the footpaths. He explained how quickly the heath bramble grew and how ferociously it resisted being manicured – as if, I thought, the ground beneath us had a rebellious spirit, too, and would not be told what it was for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prison, Van Allen had secured a new lawyer and was working towards an appeal. Those who spoke to him said he remained in decent spirits. His sense of humour, black as a night spent in a bunker, was a blessing. As part of his rehabilitation, he was asked to take part in a self-improvement course, one strand of which covered his accommodation needs. Had he thought about applying to a housing trust, after his release? Van Allen could see the funny side of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been incongruous laughter at his trial, too. Accused, police, lawyers, members of the jury – all chuckled together at Van Allen’s wordier flights while he was under interrogation. At one stage, he’d spoken wistfully of the old bunker: “My permanent des-res,” Van Allen called it. “Just an ideal spot. You had the train station, you had a cafe, you had a Starbucks, you had the hospital, you had the 168 bus, the 24, the 46 … You couldn’t see in from the footpath. It was bloody brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOCA CHICA BEACH, Texas—How badly does Elon Musk want to get to Mars? Let me tell you a story. On Sunday, February 23, Musk called an all-hands meeting at the South Texas site where SpaceX is building his Starship spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was 1am&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an hour when most Americans were throwing down their last shots before closing time, at home in bed, or binge-watching &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; before it leaves Netflix, Musk brought his team together. He wanted to know why the Starship factory wasn’t humming at all hours. Why steel sheets weren’t getting welded into domes and fuel tanks, why tanks were not being stacked into rockets, why things weren’t going as &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; as he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk always wants to go fast. He will not live forever, and the money may eventually run dry. He knows this. One day, the window to spread humanity to Mars may close, but Musk doesn’t know when. So he needs to squeeze through before the window shuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really accelerate, his bleary-eyed engineers and technicians responded, they needed enough employees to assign workers to particular stations within the burgeoning factory, allowing each person to specialize. This would require a lot more hands that could build things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘OK no problem,’” Musk recalls. “I said, ‘You can hire people—just know your reputation is on the line. Don’t bring your brother-in-law who can’t ever get a job. Not that person, OK? You’re going to be responsible for them. Everyone’s got their relatives that they know at the family gathering who, man, I sure as hell wouldn’t want to work with that person. Don’t bring that person. Bring the person who you’d put your reputation on the line for.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX had held a much publicized “career day” in early February, and the company hired several dozen new employees. By contrast, this Starship factory’s scale-up would be all word of mouth. And it would happen immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk told his team members they would have a recruitment gathering just 12 hours later, at 1pm that Sunday. They would have another one on Monday at 1pm and then again at 8pm. Long lines of people showed up, family members and friends, mostly local. Cars and trucks jammed the roadside up and down Boca Chica Highway. At 11pm on Monday night, SpaceX was still hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, the company added 252 people to its South Texas Launch Site on that Sunday and Monday. It &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; the workforce, just like that, to more than 500 workers. Most of the new hires, even those who had inked contracts at midnight, were told to report for work the next morning. A year ago, perhaps a dozen or so people worked on site. Soon, the Texas factory will probably be SpaceX’s largest location outside of its headquarters in Hawthorne, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk will spend money to go fast, and in South Texas he is proving it. In a matter of weeks, SpaceX has built a small city down here, hard by the Rio Grande River. It is all rather astonishing. And maybe, just maybe, this new Muskville really will serve as a launch pad to the first city on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet the chief engineer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, following the hiring spree, I visited the company’s facilities at Musk’s invitation. My tour included a visit to the launch pad. You may have seen the video footage of a Starship prototype known as Serial Number 1 (SN1) blowing apart during a pressurization test. This happened the night before my arrival. Engineers had loaded liquid nitrogen into the vehicle’s fuel tanks to determine their ability to hold very cold liquids at high pressure. The answer: not very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYeVnGL7fgw?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Starship SN1 test failure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bent, blackened, and charred, steel wreckage was strewn about the site. At first glance, it looked bad. But upon closer inspection, not all seemed lost. The launch tower for the vehicle appeared largely undamaged. The ground systems and fuel tanks that support Starship on the pad were located behind a berm and bore only a few scars from rocket shrapnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SN1 was never destined to fly, anyway. The plan for this vehicle, had it survived the pressurization test, was to install a Raptor engine and perform a static test firing. If everything looked just right on this test, Musk might have greenlighted a test with three Raptor engines. But probably not. The attitude of engineers working on the program boiled down to this: it sucks to lose SN1, but the next vehicle in line is already outpacing it. SN2 will soon be ready for tank testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that Musk felt particularly happy about losing a Starship. On Saturday and Sunday, he huddled with his engineers inside the University of Texas’ Stargate building, at the periphery of the company’s South Texas footprint. A year ago, the few rooms SpaceX leased on the building’s second floor were the only facilities on site aside from a few construction trailers. Now it is merely the front door. SpaceX has taken over the entire building, turning it into a mix of offices and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday afternoon, I met Musk inside a Stargate conference room where he sat at a long table, wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt and drinking a Diet Coke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I just had a lot of talks with the team about that today,” he said of the SN1 failure. “It’s what you might call the thrust puck—there’s an inverted cone where we mount the three sea-level engines. In fact, it’s drawn on that whiteboard over there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked up to the whiteboard and pointed to a frowning face. “This is my drawing,” he said with a smirk. Then, with a dry-erase marker in hand, Musk proceeded to lecture about rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a sad face because we have an inverted cone,” he said. “It’s such a dumb design. It’s one of the dumbest things on the whole rocket because it’s heavy, expensive, and unreliable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the SN1 failure boiled down to bad welds in a weak section of Starship near the engine. When exposed to pressure, the welds burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk was not happy because he had not heard about this specific issue, in this section of Starship, before the test failure. Do you think Musk addressed that with his team? Yeah, he addressed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We sent out a note to the team that this was badly designed, badly built, and badly checked,” he said. “That’s just a statement of fact. I met with the whole quality team, and I said, ‘Did you think that that thing was good?’ They said, ‘No.’ I told them that, in the future, you treat that rocket like it’s your baby, and you do not send it to the test site unless you think your baby’s going to be OK. They said that they did raise the concern to one of the engineers. But that engineer didn’t do anything. ‘OK,’ I said, ‘then you need to email me directly.’ Now they understand. If you email me directly, and if I buy off on the risk, then it’s OK. What’s not OK is they think that the weld is not good, they don’t tell me, they take it to the pad and blow it up. Now I have been clear. There’s plenty of forgiveness if you pass me the buck. There is no forgiveness if you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;NurPhoto/Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to understand about Musk is that he is the chief engineer of SpaceX—and that’s not a courtesy title. Musk previously told me that at the very beginning of SpaceX, no great engineers would take the job, and what’s the point of hiring someone to be chief engineer who isn’t great? So he became the chief engineer of SpaceX. Almost every technical rocket decision made at SpaceX comes to him eventually. Especially the hard ones. He has spent many, if not the majority, of his days since December in South Texas. During Christmas, employees there say, he worked all-nighters alongside them to get the dome structure and the welds right for SN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Musk has not been spending so much of his time in South Texas just to build a Starship. Rather, he’s trying to build a &lt;em&gt;production line for Starships&lt;/em&gt;. He wants to build a lot of them. And fast, always fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Production is at least 1,000 percent harder than making one of something,” he said. “At least 1,000 percent harder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk should know. He lived through “production hell” at Tesla in 2017 and 2018, building up factories, changing processes, spending many sleepless nights and going through all manner of mental agony. Now, Tesla is making as many as 10,000 cars a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to implement a similar system in South Texas. Musk, in fact, aims to reach a point where the company builds a Starship a week by the end of this year. And after that? Maybe they’ll go faster. SpaceX is designing its factory here to build a Starship every 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Before Clearview Became a Police Tool, It Was a Secret Plaything of the Rich</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Italian restaurant in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, when his daughter, Andrea, walked in. She was on a date with a man Mr. Catsimatidis didn’t recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Mr. Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The start-up behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Within seconds, Mr. Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter’s date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I wanted to make sure he wasn’t a charlatan,” said Mr. Catsimatidis, who then texted the man’s bio to his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly. “I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He’s very technologically savvy,” Ms. Catsimatidis said. “My date was very surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive start-up had developed a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;breakthrough facial recognition system&lt;/a&gt; that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts. Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters. Lawsuits were filed in Illinois and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In response to the criticism, Clearview published a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.clearview.ai/code_of_conduct.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“code of conduct,”&lt;/a&gt; emphasizing in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.clearview.ai/post/2020-01-27-code-of-conduct/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that its technology was “available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The post added: “We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously. Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview’s technology who are not law enforcement officials. And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company’s investors, clients and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn’t know or couldn’t recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology,” said Hoan Ton-That, the company’s co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudolph W. Giuliani when Mr. Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Mr. Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at an East Side Gristedes market. The company used the system to identify known “shoplifters or people who had held up other stores,” Mr. Catsimatidis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“People were &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2016/08/12/ice-cream-bandits-are-wreaking-havoc-on-nyc-supermarkets/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stealing our Häagen-Dazs&lt;/a&gt;. It was a big problem,” he said. He described Clearview as a “good system” that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/clearview-facial-recognition-insight-camera-glasses&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky. The publication also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Clearview’s software has been used by Best Buy, Macy’s, Kohl’s, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Mr. Ton-That and Mr. Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers. At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Clearview received a seed investment round of about $1 million in July 2018. Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pointbridgecapital.com/etf/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MAGA&lt;/a&gt;,” which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I have the app,” Mr. Lambert said in an interview. “I’ve used it to talk about what we’re doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They thought it was amazing,” he added. “They say, ‘How do I get that?’ And I say, ‘You can’t.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Scalzo, the founder of the investment firm Kirenaga Partners, said in an interview that his two school-aged daughters enjoyed playing with the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They like to use it on themselves and their friends to see who they look like in the world,” he said. “It’s kind of fun for people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the start-up contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company’s fund-raising attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Doug Leone, a billionaire partner at Sequoia, was given a login, according to three people with knowledge of Clearview’s operations. But his account was revoked when Sequoia declined to invest. A spokeswoman for Sequoia declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In September, Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhYqLbsAGk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=872&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described an app much like Clearview&lt;/a&gt; during a YouTube series called “Hot Ones,” in which guests are interviewed while eating spicy chicken wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I have an app in my phone in my pocket right now. It’s like a beta app,” Mr. Kutcher said. “It’s a facial recognition app. I can hold it up to anybody’s face here and, like, find exactly who you are, what internet accounts you’re on, what they look like. It’s terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Kutcher did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong — that his app simply replicates what other search engines do. Instead of allowing internet users to search for people’s public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For now, it’s a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Mr. Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators. Clearview’s algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the test was complete, Mr. Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview’s app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time,” Mr. Cassimatis said. “It’s road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It’s like a parlor trick. People like it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;Erin Griffith contributed reporting. Susan Beachy contributed research.&lt;/p&gt;
