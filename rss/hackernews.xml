&lt;p id=&quot;90e9&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Everyone knows that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has a problem retaining women (see, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283809613_Women_in_STEM_Family-Related_Challenges_and_Initiatives&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Jean, Payne, and Thompson 2015&lt;/a&gt;). We pour money into attracting girls and women to STEM fields. We pour money into recruiting women, training women, and addressing sexism, both overt and subconscious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491652/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;In 2011&lt;/a&gt;, the United States spent nearly $3 billion tax dollars on STEM education, of which roughly one third was spent supporting and encouraging underrepresented groups to enter STEM (including women). And yet, women are still leaving at alarming rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1e0f&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Alarming? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, alarmist? Well, &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;let’s look at some stats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0138&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;A recent report by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894845313483003#&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation (2011)&lt;/a&gt; found that women received 20.3% of the bachelor’s degrees and 18.6% of the PhD degrees in physics in 2008. In chemistry, women earned 49.95% of the bachelor’s degrees but only 36.1% of the doctoral degrees. By comparison, in biology women received 59.8% of the bachelor’s degrees and 50.6% of the doctoral degrees. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in Chemical and Engineering News showed a chart based on a survey of life sciences workers by Liftstream and MassBio demonstrating how women are vastly underrepresented in science leadership despite earning degrees at similar rates, which I’ve copied below. The story is the same in academia, as you can see on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;second chart&lt;/a&gt; — from comparable or even larger number of women at the student level, we move towards a significantly larger proportion of men at the more and more advanced stages of an academic career.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;afca&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Although 74% of women in STEM &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; “loving their work,” half (56%, in fact) leave over the course of their career — largely at the “mid-level” point, when the loss of their talent is most costly as they have just completed training and begun to contribute maximally to the work force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e60e&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01511&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;A study by Dr. Flaherty&lt;/a&gt; found that women who obtain faculty position in astronomy spent on average 1 year less than their male counterparts between completing their PhD and obtaining their position — but he concluded that this is because &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;women leave the field at a rate 3 to 4 times greater than men&lt;/strong&gt;, and in particular, if they do not obtain a faculty position quickly, will simply move to another career. So, women and men are hired at about the same rate during the early years of their post docs, but women stop applying to academic positions and drop out of the field as time goes on, pulling down the average time to hiring for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5d9a&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;There are many more studies to this effect. At this point, &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;the assertion that women leave STEM at an alarming rate after obtaining PhDs is nothing short of an established fact&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, it’s actually a problem across all academic disciplines, as you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;this matching chart&lt;/a&gt; showing the same phenomenon in humanities, social sciences, and education. The phenomenon has been affectionately dubbed the “leaky pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;50eb&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;But hang on a second, maybe there just aren’t enough women qualified for the top levels of STEM? Maybe it’ll all get better in a few years if we just wait around doing nothing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1eab&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Nope, sorry. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; says that 41% of highly qualified STEM people are female. And also, it’s clear from the previous charts and stats that a significantly larger number of women are getting PhDs than going on the be professors, in comparison to their male counterparts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Laurie Glimcher&lt;/a&gt;, when she started her professorship at Harvard University in the early 1980s, remembers seeing very few women in leadership positions. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is really going to change dramatically,’ ” she says. But 30 years later, “it’s not where I expected it to be.” Her experiences are similar to those of other leading female faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;52a4&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;So what gives? Why are all the STEM women leaving?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;49fd&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;It is widely believed that sexism is the leading problem. A quick google search of “sexism in STEM” will turn up a veritable cornucopia of articles to that effect. And indeed, around 60% of women report experiencing some form of sexism in the last year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Robnett 2016&lt;/a&gt;). So, that’s clearly not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9f28&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;And yet, if you ask leading women researchers like Nobel Laureate in Physics 2018, Professor Donna Strickland, or Canada Research Chair in Advanced Functional Materials (Chemistry), Professor Eugenia Kumacheva, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06mrmnt&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intermissionmagazine.ca/features/the-scientist-and-the-artist-conversations-with-eugenia-kumacheva-and-fiona-reid/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that sexism was not a barrier in their careers. Moreover, extensive research has shown that sexism has overall decreased since Professors Strickland and Kumacheva (for example) were starting their careers. Even more interestingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Rachael Robnett showed&lt;/a&gt; that more mathematical fields such as Physics have a greater problem with sexism than less mathematical fields, such as Chemistry, a finding which rings true with the subjective experience of many women I know in Chemistry and Physics. However, as we saw above, women leave the field of Chemistry in greater proportions following their BSc than they leave Physics. On top of that, although 22% of women &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; experiencing sexual harassment at work, the proportion is the same among STEM and non-STEM careers, and yet women leave STEM careers at a much higher rate than non-STEM careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5e9d&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;So, it seems that &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;sexism can not fully explain why women with STEM PhDs are leaving STEM&lt;/strong&gt;. At the point when women have earned a PhD, for the most part they have already survived the worst of the sexism. They’ve already proven themselves to be generally thick-skinned and, as anyone with a PhD can attest, very stubborn in the face of overwhelming difficulties. Sexism is frustrating, and it can limit advancement, but it doesn’t fully explain why we have so many women obtaining PhDs in STEM, and then leaving. In fact, at least in the U of T chemistry department, faculty hires are directly proportional to the applicant pool —although the exact number of applicants are not made public, from public information we can see that approximately one in four interview invitees are women, and approximately one in four hires are women. Our hiring committees have received bias training, and it seems that it has been largely successful. That’s not to say that we’re done, but it’s time to start looking elsewhere to explain why there are so few women sticking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;04d9&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;So why don’t more women apply?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;808d&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/14/many-women-in-stem-fields-expect-to-quit-within-five-years-survey-finds&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;one truly brilliant researcher&lt;/a&gt; had the groundbreaking idea of asking women why they left the field. When you ask women why they left, the number one reason they cite is &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;balancing work/life responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt; — which as far as I can tell is a euphemism for family concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

Women who stay in academia expect to marry later, and delay or completely forego having children, and if they do have children, plan to have fewer than their non-STEM counterparts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Sassler et al 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Owens 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Men in STEM have no such difference compared to their non-STEM counterparts; they marry and have children about the same ages and rates as their non-STEM counterparts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Sassler et al 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Women leave STEM in droves in their early to mid thirties (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Funk and Parker 2018&lt;/a&gt;) — the time when women’s fertility begins to decrease, and risks of childbirth complications begin to skyrocket for both mother and child. Men don’t see an effect on their fertility until their mid forties. Of the 56% of women who leave STEM, 50% wind up self-employed or using their training in a not for profit or government, 30% leave to a non-STEM more ‘family friendly’ career, and 20% leave to be stay-at-home moms (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Ashcraft and Blithe 2002&lt;/a&gt;). Meanwhile, institutions with better childcare and maternity leave policies have twice(!) the number of female faculty in STEM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/21/better-maternity-leave-could-help-universities-retain-women-study&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Troeger 2018&lt;/a&gt;). In analogy to the affectionately named “leaky pipeline,” the challenge of balancing motherhood and career has been titled the “maternal wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0527&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;To understand the so-called maternal wall better, let’s take a quick look at the sketch of a typical academic career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8b97&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;For the sake of this exercise, let’s all pretend to be me. I’m a talented 25 year old PhD candidate studying Physical Chemistry — I use laser spectroscopy to try to understand atypical energy transfer processes in innovative materials that I hope will one day be used to make vastly more efficient solar panels. I got my BSc in Chemistry and Mathematics at the age of 22, and have published 4 scientific papers in two different fields already (Astrophysics and Environmental Chemistry). I’ve got a big scholarship, and a lot of people supporting me to give me the best shot at an academic career — a career I dearly want. But, I also want a family — maybe two or three kids. Here’s what I can expect if I pursue an academic career:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a49a&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;With any luck, 2–3 years from now I’ll graduate with a PhD, at the age of 27. Academics are expected to travel a lot, and to move a lot, especially in their 20s and early 30s — all of the key childbearing years. I’m planning to go on exchange next year, and then the year after that I’ll need to work hard to wrap up research, write a thesis, and travel to several conferences to showcase my work. After I finish my PhD, I’ll need to undertake one or two post doctoral fellowships, lasting one or two years each, probably in completely different places. During that time, I’ll start to apply for professorships. In order to do this, I’ll travel around to conferences to advertise my work and to meet important leaders in my field, and then, if I am invited for interviews, I’ll travel around to different universities for two or three days at a time to undertake these interviews. This usually occurs in a person’s early 30s — our helpful astronomy guy, Dr. Flaherty, found the average time to hiring was 5 years, so let’s say I’m 32 at this point. If offered a position, I’ll spend the next year or two renovating and building a lab, buying equipment, recruiting talented graduate students, and designing and teaching courses. People work really, really hard during this time and have essentially no leisure time. Now I’m 34. Within usually 5 years I’ll need to apply for tenure. This means that by the time I’m 36, I’ll need to be making significant contributions in my field, and then in the final year before applying for tenure, I will once more need to travel to many conferences to promote my work, in order to secure tenure — if I fail to do so, my position at the university would probably be terminated. &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;Although many universities offer a “tenure extension” in cases where an assistant professor has had a child, this does not solve all of the problems.&lt;/strong&gt; Taking a year off during that critical 5 or 6 year period often means that the research “goes bad” — students flounder, projects that were promising get “scooped” by competitors at other institutions, and sometimes, in biology and chemistry especially, experiments literally go bad. You wind up needing to rebuild much more than just a year’s worth of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fd68&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;At no point during this time do I appear stable enough, career-wise, to take even six months off to be pregnant and care for a newborn. Hypothetical future-me is travelling around, or even moving, conducting and promoting my own independent research and training students. As you’re likely aware, very pregnant people and newborns don’t travel well. And academia has a very individualistic and meritocratic culture. Starting at the graduate level, huge emphasis is based on independent research, and independent contributions, rather than valuing team efforts. This feature of academia is both a blessing and a curse. The individualistic culture means that people have the independence and the freedom to pursue whatever research interests them — in fact this is the main draw for me personally. But it also means that there is often no one to fall back on when you need extra support, and because of biological constraints, this winds up impacting women more than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2313&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;At this point, I need to make sure that you’re aware of some basics of female reproductive biology. According to Wikipedia, the unquestionable source of all reliable knowledge, at age 25, my risk of conceiving a baby with chromosomal abnormalities (including Down’s Syndrome) is 1 in about 1400. By 35, that risk more than quadruples to 1 in 340. At 30, I have a 75% chance of a successful birth in one year, but by 35 it has dropped to 66%, and by 40 it’s down to 44%. Meanwhile, 87 to 94% of women report at least 1 health problem immediately after birth, and 1.5% of mothers have a severe health problem, while 31% have long-term persistent health problems as a result of pregnancy (defined as lasting more than six months after delivery). Furthermore, mothers over the age of 35 are at higher risk for pregnancy complications like preterm delivery, hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418963/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Cavazos-Rehg et al 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Because of factors like these, pregnancies in women over 35 are known as “geriatric pregnancies” due to the drastically increased risk of complications. This tight timeline for births is often called the “biological clock” — if women want a family, they basically need to start before 35. Now, that’s not to say it’s impossible to have a child later on, and in fact some studies show that it has positive impacts on the child’s mental health. But it is riskier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8819&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;So, women with a PhD in STEM know that they have the capability to make interesting contributions to STEM, and to make plenty of money doing it. They usually marry someone who also has or expects to make a high salary as well. But this isn’t the only consideration. Such highly educated women are usually aware of the biological clock and the risks associated with pregnancy, and are confident in their understanding of statistical risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6a6a&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/report_final_version-1_0.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; say, “The common challenge facing young women is achieving a satisfactory work-life balance, especially when children are small. From a career perspective, this period of parenthood (which after all is relatively short compared to an entire working life) tends to coincide exactly with the critical point at which an individual’s career may or may not take off. […] All the evidence shows that it is at this point that women either drop out of the workforce altogether, switch to part-time working or move to more family-friendly jobs, which may be less demanding and which do not always utilise their full skillset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6880&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;And in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, “The research project in Tilburg also showed that women academics have more often no children or fewer children than women outside academia.” Meanwhile in &lt;a href=&quot;https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; “On a personal level, the data show that for a significant number of women there is a trade-off between family and work: a large share of female economists in Italy do not live with a partner and do not have children”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d701&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;Most jobs available to women with STEM PhDs offer greater stability and a larger salary earlier in the career. Moreover, most non-academic careers have less emphasis on independent research, meaning that employees usually work within the scope of a larger team, and so if a person has to take some time off, there are others who can help cover their workload. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;By and large&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;, women leave to go to a career where they will be stable, well funded, and well supported, even if it doesn’t fulfill their passion for STEM — or they leave to be stay-at-home moms or self-employed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b130&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;I would presume that if we made academia a more feasible place for a woman with a family to work, we could keep almost all of those 20% of leavers who leave to just stay at home, almost all of the 30% who leave to self-employment, and all of those 30% who leave to more family friendly careers (after all, if academia were made to be as family friendly as other careers, there would be no incentive to leave). Of course, there is nothing wrong with being a stay at home parent — it’s an admirable choice and contributes greatly to our society. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salary.com/articles/stay-at-home-mom/&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;One estimate&lt;/a&gt; valued the equivalent salary benefit of stay-at-home parenthood at about $160,000/year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssb.no/forskning/discussion-papers/_attachment/113165?_ts=13ea1e1e480&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Moreover&lt;/a&gt;, children with a stay-at-home parent show long term benefits such as better school performance — something that most academic women would want for their children. &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;But a lot of people only choose it out of necessity — about half of stay-at-home moms would prefer to be working&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-017-9534-7&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Ciciolla, Curlee, &amp;amp; Luthar 2017&lt;/a&gt;). When the reality is that your salary is barely more than the cost of daycare, then a lot of people wind up giving up and staying home with their kids rather than paying for daycare. In a heterosexual couple it will usually be the woman that winds up staying home since she is the one who needs to do things like breast feed anyways. And so we lose these women from the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;050e&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;And yet, somehow, during this informal research adventure of mine, most scholars and policy makers seem to be advising that we try to encourage young girls to be interested in STEM, and to address sexism in the workplace, with the implication that this will fix the high attrition rate in STEM women. But from what I’ve found, &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;the stats don’t back up sexism as the main reason women leave&lt;/strong&gt;. There is sexism, and that is a problem, and women do leave STEM because of it — but it’s a problem that we’re already dealing with pretty successfully, and it’s not why the majority of women who have already obtained STEM PhDs opt to leave the field. The whole family planning thing is huge and for some reason, almost totally swept under the rug — mostly because we’re too shy to talk about it, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f8ae&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;In fact, I think that the plethora of articles suggesting that the problem is sexism actually contribute to our unwillingness to talk about the family planning problem, because it reinforces the perception that that men in power will not hire a woman for fear that she’ll get pregnant and take time off. &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;Why would anyone talk about how they want to have a family when they keep hearing that even the mere suggestion of such a thing will limit their chances of being hired?&lt;/strong&gt; I personally know women who have avoided bringing up the topic with colleagues or supervisors for fear of professional repercussions. So we spend all this time and energy talking about how sexism is really bad, and very little time trying to address the family planning challenge, because, I guess, as the stats show, if women are serious enough about science then they just give up on the family (except for the really, really exceptional ones who can handle the stresses of both simultaneously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;550f&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;To be very clear, I’m not saying that sexism is not a problem. What I am saying is that, thanks to the sustained efforts of a large number of people over a long period of time, we’ve reduced the sexism problem to the point where, at least at the graduate level, it is no longer the largest major barrier to women’s advancement in STEM. &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;Hurray!&lt;/strong&gt; That does not mean that we should stop paying attention to the issue of sexism, but does mean that &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;it’s time to start paying more attention to other issues&lt;/strong&gt;, like how to properly support women who want to raise a family while also maintaining a career in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;492b&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;So what can we do to better support STEM women who want families?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d795&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;A couple of solutions have been tentatively tested. From a study mentioned above, it’s clear that &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;providing free and conveniently located childcare makes a colossal difference to women’s choices of whether or not to stay in STEM&lt;/strong&gt;, alongside extended and paid maternity leave. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; popular and successful strategy was implemented by a leading woman in STEM, Laurie Glimcher, a past Harvard Professor in Immunology and now CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. While working at NIH, &lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;Dr. Glimcher designed a program to provide primary caregivers (usually women) with an assistant or lab technician to help manage their laboratories while they cared for children&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she has created a similar program to pay for a technician or postdoctoral researcher for assistant professors. In the academic setting, Dr. Glimcher’s strategies are key for helping to alleviate the challenges associated with the individualistic culture of academia without compromising women’s research and leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dd08&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;For me personally, I’m in the ideal situation for an academic woman. I graduated my BSc with high honours in four years, and with many awards. I’ve already had success in research and have published several peer reviewed papers. I’ve faced some mild sexism from peers and a couple of TAs, but nothing that’s seriously held me back. My supervisors have all been extremely supportive and feminist, and all of the people that I work with on a daily basis are equally wonderful. Despite all of this support, I’m looking at the timelines of an academic career, and the time constraints of female reproduction, and honestly, I don’t see how I can feasible expect to stay in academia and have the family life I want. And since I’m in the privileged position of being surrounded by supportive and feminist colleagues, I can say it: I’m considering leaving academia, if something doesn’t change, because even though I love it, I don’t see how it can fit in to my family plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4038&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fo ge&quot;&gt;But wait! All of these interventions are really expensive. Money doesn’t just grow on trees, you know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7f25&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;It doesn’t in general, but in this case it kind of does — well, actually, we already grew it. We spend billions of dollars training women in STEM. By not making full use of their skills, if we look at only the american economy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0894845318784745&quot; class=&quot;at cg ga gb gc gd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;we are wasting about $1.5 billion USD per year&lt;/a&gt; in economic benefits they would have produced if they stayed in STEM. So here’s a business proposal: let’s spend half of that on better family support and scientific assistants for primary caregivers, and keep the other half in profit. Heck, let’s spend 99% — $1.485 billion (in the states alone) on better support. That should put a dent in the support bill, and I’d sure pick up $15 million if I saw it lying around. Wouldn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;28b9&quot; class=&quot;fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz&quot;&gt;By demonstrating that we will support women in STEM who choose to have a family, we will encourage more women with PhDs to apply for the academic positions that they are eminently qualified for. Our institutions will benefit from the wider applicant pool, and our whole society will benefit from having the skills of these highly trained and intelligent women put to use innovating new solutions to our modern day challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Startup Ideas 2020</title>
<link>https://dcgross.com/2020-startup-themes/?src=t</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dcgross.com/2020-startup-themes/?src=t</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;time class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;January 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some interesting markets and themes for the year. I use “themes” in a broad sense, both for specific markets as well as broader societal changes in the seed ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 11 of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-the-law-of-advertiser-atrophy&quot;&gt;1. The Law of Advertiser Atrophy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad companies are governed by a rule as durable as gravity: they must make their products worse over time. Corporations must produce profit, and the fastest path to increase revenue is at the cost of user experience. Amazon and Google used to feel powerful and sleek. Now they’re like Costco on Black Friday. Noisy, tacky and ad-riddled. And more profitable! (For now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase in revenue comes at the cost of long-term customer satisfaction, but nobody knows how to really measure that, so investors don’t care. Now Instagram has too many ads and finding a genuine phone charger on Amazon requires a degree in investigative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this chewing gum loses flavor in the coming year, there might be an opportunity for startups to traverse previously impassable peaks and attack an incumbent head-on. A new search engine. A new social network. It’s been a while since we had a new consumer startup, and it might just happen next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s left holding the bag?&lt;/strong&gt; Timing is the ultimate catalyst for a short trade, and it would be unwise to bet against Amazon today. But one wonders if and when this will change. If the incumbent will manage to maintain relevance while the Great Man, the one responsible for overriding the short-termism of the free market, is off building rockets or at Burning Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-saying-yes-to-nocode&quot;&gt;2. Saying Yes to NoCode &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoCode startups were the defining theme of 2019. The idea behind NoCode is to make a new abstraction for software engineering. Just like Javascript made programming more accessible to a broader audience. If that were possible, new enterprise software could be constructed at a fraction of current costs. Who needs a Stanford graduate if you can build your widget with a few clicks? There are dozens of teams and seed-stage companies working on variants of this now. The market segments into two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPA (“Robotic Process Automation”). The idea is to automate mundane, repeated actions that information workers are doing by observing their actions and then mimicking them, like a human would do. UIPath is the darling of this world, with many small startups in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lego Software.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of “watching” a human and “automating” their needs, lego software companies make it possible to compose a symphony by clicking and dragging. What previously took three Stanford undergrads can be done with a mouse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; allows builders to move data between different services with a few clicks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; enable advanced storage and manipulation of data through a simple interface. &lt;a href=&quot;https://glideapps.com/&quot;&gt;Glide&lt;/a&gt; super-charges those databases by enabling builders to turn them into mobile apps, a skill previously relegated to an elite few. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tryretool.com/&quot;&gt;Retool&lt;/a&gt; offers related “assembly” functionality for the desktop. See more in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcgross.com/2019-frontier-markets/&quot;&gt;2019 Themes&lt;/a&gt; Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s left holding the bag?&lt;/strong&gt; Many of these companies are eating away at the fringe of software consultancy giants like Accenture and Deloitte. It’ll be interesting to see if any of the darling startups eat up material share of these giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-new-meme-enterprise-search&quot;&gt;3. The New Meme: Enterprise Search&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enterprise search” is shaping up to be in 2020 what RPA was in 2019. A startup idea that hits the seed ecosystem like a fashion fad, with a surprising number of founders suddenly all wearing the same ripped jeans. I’ve seen about a dozen teams and companies working on next-generation enterprise search in the past few weeks. They’re all attempting to build the same thing: a search/feed/discovery product that helps you find things amongst Slack, Gmail and Salesforce clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve yet to see anyone properly tackle the more rudimentary, “boring” and lucrative approach: an on-prem search appliance, similar to GSE, that indexes internal intranet, wikis as well as email. On-prem software is annoying to build, something many founders shy away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, this category will be one to watch. Just like photo-sharing apps were in 2011, the Californian startup optimism moves in fixed fashion fads, and this one is about to become Trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-digital-trade-war&quot;&gt;4. Digital Trade War&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.larksuite.com/&quot;&gt;Lark&lt;/a&gt; very interesting. Lark is a mobile-first clone of Microsoft Office and Slack that quietly launched this year. Here’s the twist: it’s made by Bytedance, the Chinese company that created TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While far from perfect, Lark is surprisingly well built. What happens when it gets popular in the America? Will Microsoft / Google petition to ban it, the beginning of the Great American Firewall? Alternatively, how would success in China affect Microsoft Office revenue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market has priced in the trade war in atoms, but not in bits. A digital trade war is yet to come. TikTok has already been banned by the US Military. Will it be in the US App Store by years end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-the-privacy-headfake&quot;&gt;5. The Privacy Headfake&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of excitement around building a better Google. DuckDuckGo is small, but it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/traffic&quot;&gt;growing 50% year-over-year&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, it is also a search option on every European Android device. If the growth rate were to double, DDG would surpass &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in 6 years. That’s at least mildly interesting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cliqz.com/&quot;&gt;Cliqz&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining traction amongst a more technical crowd. The Brave browser has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/brave-passes-10m-mau/&quot;&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; (though with interestingly poor retention) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacy.com/&quot;&gt;Privacy.com&lt;/a&gt; has been doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excitement aside, it’s not clear to me that privacy is an actual value proposition to customers. Privacy might be the digital spinach: something you know that’s good for you, beloved by regulators, but not a primary driver for anyone but the most extreme health consumers. I suspect we’ll see a lot of startups pitch privacy, but I’m not certain of the adoption they’ll get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While consumer privacy might be overrated, enterprise ephemerality is underrated. In an era of constant breaches and hacks, retaining all of your corporate (and personal) information might be seen as a bug rather than a feature. What opportunities does this open up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-uai-useful-ai&quot;&gt;6. UAI (Useful AI)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about machine learning a lot, but few (if any) successful startups have managed to apply it in a non-incremental, breakthrough product. That’s beginning to change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klaritylaw.com/&quot;&gt;Klarity&lt;/a&gt; is a digital paralegal, turning contracts into forms and annotating legal documents. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rossum.ai/&quot;&gt;Rossum&lt;/a&gt; is a software filing cabinet, using deep learning to structure and organize contracts. OpenAI’s GPT-2 model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1192455167125274625&quot;&gt;approaching the point&lt;/a&gt; where it can replace Demand Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More is on the cusp. Live, auto-generated closed captioning &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2019/09/16/hangouts-meet-live-captions/&quot;&gt;works now&lt;/a&gt;. Given free transcription and the drive of remote work to video conferencing, we’re about to witness a Cambrian explosion of cataloged meeting information. What was previously oral knowledge will be automatically documented by machines. We’ll see many opportunities come out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while one might think value at the lower layers of the stack would accrue to incumbents, challenger startups continue to show promise, both at the API (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.assemblyai.com/&quot;&gt;AssemblyAI&lt;/a&gt;, cheaper and better speech API) and silicon layers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cerebras.net/product/&quot;&gt;Cerebras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graphcore.ai/&quot;&gt;GraphCore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://groq.com/&quot;&gt;Groq&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-radar&quot;&gt;7. Radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy, 5G and other factors have created a relaxed regulatory environment for radar, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multichannel.com/news/fcc-votes-to-divide-5-9-ghz-to-help-conquer-5g&quot;&gt;seeping over&lt;/a&gt; to other industries. Startups like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zendar.io/&quot;&gt;Zendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/arbe-raises-32-million-to-bring-its-high-resolution-radar-to-autonomous-vehicles/&quot;&gt;Arbe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vayyar.com/&quot;&gt;Vayyar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/leo-labs-and-its-high-fidelity-space-radar-track-orbital-debris-better-than-ever-from-new-zealand/&quot;&gt;Leo Labs&lt;/a&gt; are all examples of radar-first companies in the aerospace and autonomy market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might expand beyond that too: Apple has its Ultra Wideband Technology. Amazon’s Sidewalk uses radar to build a location-based mesh network. Google’s Project Soli uses radar to turn hand gestures into keyboard input. (Interestingly, regulators have taken note — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20917743/google-pixel-4-no-india-launch-motion-sense-radar-spectrum-issues&quot;&gt;the Pixel 4 is banned in India&lt;/a&gt; due to the spectrum this radar uses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, Software-defined radio has become recently cheap enough for anyone to experiment. You can build your own cell tower spoofer for $15. You can jam satellite signals. Many interesting military and consumer applications to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-remote--collaboration&quot;&gt;8. Remote &amp;amp; Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, where are you going to settle your company?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used to be a trick question. Investors would penalize founders who answered anything other than “San Francisco”. That’s changed over the past year. Remote is acceptable, even encouraged. This might be due to good video conferencing, Bay Area housing, and perhaps most importantly — GitLab and Zapier’s success, providing proof of “fully distributed unicorns”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, remote is in vogue and founders are rushing to build all parts of the distributed startup supply chain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/terminal-raises-17m-led-by-8vc-to-source-and-build-remote-teams-of-engineers/&quot;&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt; helps generate remote teams, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/&quot;&gt;Tandem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://there.team/&quot;&gt;There&lt;/a&gt; attempt to create a remote “office”, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/loom-video/amp/&quot;&gt;Loom&lt;/a&gt; helps teams share their work over video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by this trend, collaboration products continue to be popular. &lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly the wiki of choice for teams. &lt;a href=&quot;https://coda.io/welcome&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://threads.com/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; are building new hybrid variants of Google Docs, bringing the best of Slack and documents together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; remains an ever-popular multiplayer Photoshop (and a growing home to many lonely emails from investors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the stack are owned by incumbents (Slack, Hangouts, Zoom). I’m not certain their position is infinitely stable. Zoom, for example, has a fantastic “molecule moat”: the IP is hard to create. But there’s no tax on switching. It’s just a link you share over Slack. You could imagine a new Zoom getting adopted very quickly if it was better[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-developer-tools&quot;&gt;9. Developer Tools&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year GitHub was acquired for $7.5B. Like cracking open a Coke on a hot summer day, Microsoft immediately whetted the appetite of investors for this category. In Q3 2017 the median fundraise for a startup in this category was $1.6M. By Q3 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/developer-tools-startups#section-funding&quot;&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; to $5.5M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GCP and AWS are great at the “dumb end” (compute, storage), their top-of-the-value-chain solutions are awful[2]. Using GCP or AWS’s console like trying to sprint through molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves an opening for youthful startups to build: &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/about&quot;&gt;Zeit&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly a default choice for small team deployment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/&quot;&gt;Repl.it&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid playground for running and experimenting with code. I increasingly see &lt;a href=&quot;https://sidekiq.org/&quot;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; (job queue for Ruby) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://metabase.com/&quot;&gt;Metabase&lt;/a&gt; (a dashboard builder) open in founders’ tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is eating the software that ate the world, and specialized ML tools are growing with it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepnote.com/&quot;&gt;Deepnote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt; are working on better versions of Jupyter, a popular open source workbench for ML. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wandb.com/&quot;&gt;Weights and Biases&lt;/a&gt; is building a Tableau for data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-the-enterprise-dabblers&quot;&gt;10. The Enterprise Dabblers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September&quot;&gt;Eternal September&lt;/a&gt; describes how Internet forums worsened as the web became popular. This effect is also true for ideas. A scene is best when it’s the unknown frontier. In 2018, RPA was a bit of a secret. Few knew about it. By working on it, a founder self-selected themselves as disagreeable and driven. They were climbing Everest before it was popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed earlier, the secret is now out: from &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; to UIPath to &lt;a href=&quot;https://retool.com/&quot;&gt;Retool&lt;/a&gt;, the new darlings of “NoCode” have caught the attention of young founders who want to build empires. The scene has become popular, and commensurate with that the quality has gone down. As of today (January 2019), we see a half dozen pitches a week for automation software. Most lack deep insights on the market. They just want to join the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What used to be a signal of originality is now a signal of conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend will continue into the next year. The seed market is as hyperactive as a 10 year old guzzling Mountain Dew. There’s an infinite number of fresh fund managers who will gladly deploy capital to these enterprise dabblers in the hopes of the team “figuring it out later”. Don’t get me wrong – we’re always happy to take a bet on a team. But once an idea becomes popular, selection becomes harder. We have a strong aversion to the lack of crisp, rigorous thinking that seems to be so rampant right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-carbon--climate&quot;&gt;11. Carbon &amp;amp; Climate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate startup scene has gone from being frigid and lonely to a raging inferno of activity. Consumer-facing companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://joro.tech/&quot;&gt;Joro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://netzero.world/&quot;&gt;NetZero&lt;/a&gt; that are working on nudging consumers to buy sustainable products with point programs. We know branded credit cards cultivate loyalty to Target or American Airlines. Assuredly they can achieve a similar effect for Earth! Get 2X the points if you bring your cup to Starbucks. (I don’t know how much of a planetary impact this will have, but that’s another issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greengovernance.org/&quot;&gt;GreenGovernance&lt;/a&gt; is creating a drop-in replacement for BlockRock and Vanguard. Hold the same assets, but use shareholder power to entice companies to lower emissions. Carl Icahn, but focused on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme is geo-engineering, with one popular approach of capturing carbon by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine&quot;&gt;olivine&lt;/a&gt; or other means. Bill Gates-backed &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbonengineering.com/&quot;&gt;Carbon Engineering&lt;/a&gt; is the startup-incumbent, having recently raised $68M. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-30/in-silicon-valley-the-quest-to-make-gasoline-out-of-thin-air?&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; claims it’ll convert carbon into fuel next year(!). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charmindustrial.com/&quot;&gt;Charm Industrial&lt;/a&gt; (started by the founders of Segment and Firebase) is working on creating cheap, carbon-neutral hydrogen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/climeworks-business-climate-change.html&quot;&gt;Climeworks&lt;/a&gt; is making a giant air filter for Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And plenty more pre-launch teams. Feels like we’re just warming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this list was interesting! Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:d@dcgross.com&quot;&gt;d@dcgross.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://pioneer.app&quot;&gt;https://pioneer.app&lt;/a&gt; if you want to get funded for any of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] What would make a better Zoom merits another post, but proof we can do better is reality. Video conferencing is not as pleasant as meeting in the real world. Why? Lots to consider here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Tales of Google’s internal infrastructure tools are legendary. Yet GCP’s web console moves slower than a sleepy elephant. Dissecting why this is possible, structurally, is a very interesting question. Organizations are great at promoting agreeable, consensus-seeking individuals. These people build agreeable, “just OK” products. The disagreeable and driven rarely get sufficient authority to do anything radical. Hence startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] I have mixed emotions about this category. Despite frenetic activity, one should remember the basic laws of market physics. I use these products daily, but I’m an engineer. One of a lucky few. There aren’t enough of me, and I always wonder how large these markets are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there’s still so much to be built. Making software is still hard compared to what it should be. Packages never install properly. DNS is a mess. Constant data leaks. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DigitalOcean is laying off staff</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/digitalocean-layoffs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/digitalocean-layoffs/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;After appointing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/digitalocean-gets-a-new-ceo-and-cfo/&quot;&gt;new CEO and CFO last summer&lt;/a&gt;, cloud infrastructure provider &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalocean.com&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; is embarking on a wider reorganisation: the startup has announced a round of layoffs, with potentially between 30 and 50 people affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/digitalocean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;digitalocean&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed the news with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DigitalOcean recently announced a restructuring to better align its teams to its go-forward growth strategy. As part of this restructuring, some roles were, unfortunately, eliminated. DigitalOcean continues to be a high-growth business with $275M in [annual recurring revenues] and more than 500,000 customers globally. Under this new organizational structure, we are positioned to accelerate profitable growth by continuing to serve developers and entrepreneurs around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the confirmation was sent to us this morning, a number of footprints began to emerge last night, when the layoffs first hit, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=digitalocean&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&quot;&gt;people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; talking about it, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffMcAdams/status/1217905473938239488&quot;&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; that they are looking for new opportunities and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markimbriaco/status/1217955979989602304&quot;&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; help to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thinkshiv/status/1217942597739646982&quot;&gt;those impacted&lt;/a&gt;. Inbound tips that we received estimate the cuts at between 30 and 50 people. With around 500 employees (an estimate on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/58199-41&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt;), that would work out to up to 10% of staff affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what is going on here — we’ll update as and when we hear more — but when Yancey Spruill and Bill Sorenson were respectively appointed CEO and CFO in July 2019 (Spruill replacing someone who was only in the role for a year), the incoming CEO put out a short statement that, in hindsight, hinted at a refocus of the business in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My aspiration is for us to continue to provide everything you love about DO now, but to also enhance our offerings in a way that is meaningful, strategic and most helpful for you over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company provides a range of cloud infrastructure services to developers, including scalable compute services (“Droplets” in DigitalOcean terminology), managed Kubernetes clusters, object storage, managed database services, Cloud Firewalls, Load Balancers and more, with 12 data centers globally. It says it works with more than 1 million developers across 195 countries. It has also been expanding the services that it offers to developers, including more enhancements in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/digitalocean-launches-a-managed-postgresql-database-service/&quot;&gt;managed database services&lt;/a&gt;, and a free hosting option for continuous code testing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/gitlab-digital-ocean-partnership-to-provide-free-hosting-for-continuous-online-code-testing/&quot;&gt;partnership with GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, as my colleague Frederic pointed out when DigitalOcean appointed its latest CEO, while developers have generally been happy with the company, it isn’t as hyped as it once was, and is a smallish player nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in an area of business where economies of scale are essential for making good margins on a business, it competes against some of the biggest leviathans in tech: Google (and its Google Cloud Platform), Amazon (which as AWS) and Microsoft (with Azure). That could mean that DigitalOcean is either trimming down as it talks to investors for a new round; or to better conserve cash as it sizes up how best to compete against these bigger, deep-pocketed players; or perhaps to start thinking about another kind of exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context, it’s notable that the company not only appointed a new CFO last summer, but also a CEO with prior CFO experience. It’s been a while since DigitalOcean has raised capital. According to PitchBook data, DigitalOcean last raised money in 2017, an undisclosed amount from Mighty Capital, Glean Capital, Viaduct Ventures, Black River Ventures, Hanaco Venture Capital, Torch Capital and EG Capital Advisors. Before that, it took out $130 million in debt, in 2016. Altogether it has raised $198 million, and its last valuation was from a round in 2015, $683 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been an active week for layoffs among tech startups. Mozilla &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/&quot;&gt;laid off 70 employees this week&lt;/a&gt;; and the weed delivery platform Eaze is also gearing up for more cuts amid an &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/eaze-out-of-cash-to-burn/&quot;&gt;emergency push for funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll update this post as we learn more. Best wishes to those affected by the news.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Sad Day for Rust</title>
<link>https://words.steveklabnik.com/a-sad-day-for-rust</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://words.steveklabnik.com/a-sad-day-for-rust</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-01-17&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;January 17, 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actix/actix-web&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;actix-web&lt;/code&gt; is dead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is bad, from all sides. When Rust was a tiny, tiny community, I thought to myself, “wow, I wonder how long this will last? Probably 1.0 will kill it.” Sort of playing off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September&quot;&gt;Eternal September&lt;/a&gt;, I assumed that over time, the community would grow, and we’d encounter problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day where I say to myself, okay, has that happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is not super clear-cut. I’m not going to link to a dozen citations, or try to prove that I’m some sort of neutral party here. I’m going to give you account of this story as I remember it and as I felt it. Because this isn’t really about playing judge. This is about thinking about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been very clear from the beginning that the Rust project saw Rust as more than just the language. The community and the people mattered. From the earliest days, leadership explicitly took the position that it wasn’t just the code, but the people around the project were important. Of course, people are also people, and so this wasn’t perfect; we’ve made several fairly large mis-steps here over the years. But Rust has been an experiment in community building as much as an experiment in language building. Can we reject the idea of a BDFL? Can we include as many people as possible? Can we be welcoming to folks who historically have not had great representation in open source? Can we reject &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture&quot;&gt;contempt culture&lt;/a&gt;? Can we be inclusive of beginners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has a necessary feature, &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;, that allows you to escape Rust’s guarantees. This is a really important part of Rust, but also a very dangerous one, hence the name. But one of the things that’s important about it is that, since &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; means “I have checked this code, and it upholds all of the guarantees the compiler cannot check,” you can build a safe interface with unsafe guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with anything outside of the language, for example, using the operating system to print to the screen, or write a file, has to be &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;, and so without this property, all programs would be &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;. This premise is treated skeptically by many, but has generally been demonstrated to have worked out. Several folks are in the process of providing tooling to prove that your &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; code is correct, and provided proofs for a bunch of the standard library’s &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; code. It not only found a few places where there were bugs, but also a few places where the restrictions were too tight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “generally” is doing a lot of work in that previous sentence. This setup creates a gnawing fear in the back of people’s minds: what if some foundational package uses &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;, but uses it incorrectly? What happens when this causes problems for every package that uses that package? This relationship between safe and unsafe is also a bit hard to understand, and so, when bugs are found around unsafe, people &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of Rust often use it to suggest that all of Rust is a house of cards. While Rust has “made it” in many senses, it has not quite yet in many others, and so I think this produces a fundamental anxiety in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of making it, actix-web is a good web framework. It came onto the scene, and people generally liked it. It also performed extremely well. Its score on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/&quot;&gt;Techempower&lt;/a&gt; in particular was impressive, and got more impressive over time. Its author also works at Microsoft, and suggested that Microsoft is using actix-web in production. This was really exciting to people. This was the second project using Rust at Microsoft, and so this seemed really fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into that, though, there’s also the matter of Reddit. The team has basically rejected Reddit for said social reasons. We provide alternate forums for folks, but Reddit is a huge place. The Rust subreddit has ~87,000 subscribers, partially thanks to this. And, for a while, the Rust reddit was a decent place. I still think it’s better than most reddits, but it’s degraded much more quickly than the community at large. “Why Reddit is like this” is a whole other essay; I think it’s built into reddit’s structure itself. But the point is, while Reddit is not official, and so not linked to by any official resources, it’s still a very large group of people, and so to suggest it’s “not the Rust community” in some way is both true and very not true. For the purposes of this story, I think it has to be included in the broader community, and I think that this situation has brought new questions about the relationship of the project and Reddit, though this is already far too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, someone takes a peek under the covers, and it turns out actix-web is using a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of unsafe code. That’s not inherently a problem. The problem is, a lot of that unsafe code is not actually needed. This is where things start to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of actix-web basically says “nah it’s fine.” This is basically the perfect storm of unsafe anxiety: a big, important, visible library, a bunch of &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;, and an unresponsive author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s important to mention that people were not just complaining: they were writing code. It is easy to frame this as a case of open source entitlement, and it still very may well be, but this isn’t just empty complaints. Patches were included, they just weren’t welcome. And that’s also not inherently wrong either; a project maintainer shouldn’t be required to accept a patch just because it exists…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit whips itself into a frenzy. Lots of ugly things are said. More issues are opened, and closed, and locked. Eventually, the author accepts some code that drops the total unsafe count significantly and has more sound usage of what’s left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were not happy about how all this played out, for a variety of reasons and in a variety of ways. I haven’t spoken to actix-web’s author, but I can’t imagine that he was very happy about it either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it happens all over again. More unsafe, more patches rejected, more Reddit, more bad blood. I thought that at this point, the author said he was quitting, but that may be faulty memory, or maybe he changed his mind. Regardless, how responsive would you be, if you were the maintainer, after the shit-show of last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were not happy about how all this played out, for a variety of reasons and in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was quiet for a while, and actix-web kept climbing the Techempower benchmarks, reaching the top of most of them by a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. It is wicked fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, yesterday, a post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shnatsel/smoke-testing-rust-http-clients-b8f2ee5db4e6&quot;&gt;Smoke-testing Rust HTTP clients&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gets published. It focuses on a, well, smoke test of Rust HTTP clients, but it also comments a lot on the complexity of each project, and the amount of &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;. The author found and filed a lot of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the dependencies reveals that it relies on actix-service, which underpins all of Actix and has a bespoke and unsound Cell implementation. For example, this method violates memory safety by handing out multiple mutable references to the same data, which can lead to e.g. a use-after-free vulnerability. I have reported the issue to the maintainers, but they have refused to investigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes the now-usual Reddit uproar. It’s extra nasty this time. Some people go far, far, far over the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the maintainer has quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, on some level, this situation is over: there will not be a fourth huge actix-web drama. But it’s really left a bad taste in my mouth. It’s unfortunate that a well-known project had soundness issues. It’s unfortunate that the maintainer wasn’t receptive to fixing them. At the same time, I’ve been there: being a maintainer is tough. It’s also unfortunate that there’s this &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt; of response, and kind, and volume. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true that the situation was dangerous. But did it have to be handled this way? You have to understand a lot of nuance here to even know the main points of the story. One version of this story that will certainly be told is “The Rust community says they’re nice but they will harass you if you use unsafe wrong.” Is that what we want? I, for one, do not. If you’re a part of Rust, you gotta ask yourself: are you happy with this outcome? How did your actions (or lack thereof) contribute to it? Could you have done something better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure where we go from here, and I’m not sure what we could have done to prevent this from happening. But I feel like this is a failure, and it’s set Rust back a bit, and I’m just plain sad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;3,860&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;3,860&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Actix project postmortem</title>
<link>https://github.com/actix/actix-web</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/actix/actix-web</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another &quot;unsafe shitstorm”, I guess I get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting how easy to move comment out of context and how hard to comment with very clear intention (especially if you are not native speaker) What was the patch? It was very strait forward, simple, uncreative change, intention was just to remove unsafe not to fix existing code. I believe software development is one of the most creative work we do, and creativity is part of why we love software development, why it is fun. Especially if you combine it with real world projects constraints. “creative constrains” could be source of very interesting solutions. Being on the edge of your abilities is super fun. So uncreative change felt boring (oh! And author gave up copyright claims for that patch (a bit irony and sarcasm)). I’ve never used unsafe unintentionally, I use it because I believe usage is safe. There was no any malicious intentions. I believed it held mutable aliasing invariant and I was very happy that someone found real problem. I wanted to solve the problem, just with a bit of creativity. And use RefCell solution only if it would be not possible to solve it with any other way. Btw, I like the solution I found, it is in master and solves the problem at least one from the issue. If you want to push boundaries you have to touch this boundaries and sometimes you push too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a maintainer of large open source project is not a fun task. You alway face with rude and hate, everyone knows better how to build software, nobody wants to do home work and read docs and think a bit and very few provide any help. Seems everyone believes there is large team behind actix with unlimited time and budget. (Btw thanks to everyone who provided prs and other help!) For example, async/await took three weeks 12 hours/day work stint, quite exhausting, and what happened after release, I started to receive complaints that docs are not updated and i have to go fix my shit. Encouraging. You could notice after each unsafe shitstorm, i started to spend less and less time with the community. You felt betrayed after you put so much effort and then to hear all this shit comments, even if you understand that that is usual internet behavior. Anyway, removing issue was a stupid idea. But I was pissed off with last two personal comments, especially while sitting and thinking how to solve the problem. I am sorry for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been three years since I started actix project (time flies). I learnt a lot, i meet new people, I found language that I really like and want to use it fulltime, I found fun job. But damage to the project's reputation is done and I don’t think it is possible to recover. Actix always will be “shit full of UB” and “benchmark cheater”. (Btw, with tfb benchmark I just wanted to push rust to the limits, I wanted it to be on the top, I didn’t want to push other rust frameworks down.) Everything started with actix, then actix-web and then actix-net. It took a lot of time to design api and architecture. Each of this projects was rewritten from scratch at least 4-5 time. I hope I expanded some boundaries and found few new patterns, I hope other developers will check source code and find inspiration to move even further. Nowadays supporting actix project is not fun, and be part of rust community is not fun as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am done with open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I moved actix-net and actix-web project to my personal github account. I will make decision during next couple days what to do. I don’t want to see the project becomes ghost of what it was. Maintainers must understand how everything work, but don’t anyone who does and those who could are busy with other projects. At the moment I am planing to make repos private and then delete them (will remove benchmarks as well), unless others suggest better ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything has to come to the end. It was fun trip but now is time to move on. Life should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lifesaving mission as dramatic as any in the months-long battle against the wildfires that have torn through the Australian bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of a race to save humans or animals, a specialized team of Australian firefighters was bent on saving invaluable plant life: hidden groves of the Wollemi pine, a prehistoric tree species that has outlived the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wollemia nobilis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64545&quot;&gt;peaked in abundance&lt;/a&gt; 34 million to 65 million years ago, before a steady decline. Today, only 200 of the trees exist in their natural environment — all within the canyons of Wollemi National Park, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/Science/Our-work-discoveries/Germplasm-Conservation-Horticulture/Wollemi-Pine-Conservation-Program/Wollemi-Pine-FAQs/Why-was-it-so-extraordinary&quot;&gt;just 100 miles&lt;/a&gt; west of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees are so rare that they were thought to be extinct until 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the year David Noble, an officer with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, rappelled into a narrow canyon and came across a grove of large trees he didn't recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble brought back a few twigs and showed them to biologists and botanists who were similarly stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, Noble returned to the grove with scientists. It was then that they realized what they had found: &quot;a tree outside any existing genus of the ancient Araucariaceae family of conifers,&quot; the &lt;em&gt;American Scientist&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanscientist.org/article/ancient-wollemi-pines-resurgent&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2004/wollemia-nobilis.html&quot;&gt;The trees&lt;/a&gt; are tall and can reach 130 feet high in the wild. They have thin, fragile bark covered in dark brown nodules that give them a sort of &quot;bubbly&quot; appearance. They bear cones that appear at the end of their branches, and the trees are monoecious, meaning that each plant has both male and female cones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Australia's wildfires started burning toward Wollemi National Park in recent weeks, firefighters from the parks and wildlife service and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service put a carefully planned operation into motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a key asset, not only for the national parks, but for our entire country,&quot; Matt Kean, New South Wales' environment minister, said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/prehistoric-wollemi-pine-groves-saved-from-nsw-bushfires/11872460&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large air tankers dropped fire retardant around the pines. Firefighters set up an irrigation system around the trees to keep them wet. Specialist teams winched from helicopters down to the forest floor to make sure it stayed wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the fire did go through, we wanted it to be a cool burn as opposed to a hot burn to give them the best chance of survival,&quot; Kean said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefighters winched their way from helicopters to the forest floor. The exact location of the groves is a carefully guarded secret. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;New South Wales Government&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire did sweep through the canyons, and through the groves where these trees have somehow survived for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few days, the smoke was so thick that it wasn't clear whether the plan had worked. &quot;We all waited with bated breath,&quot; Kean said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last the smoke abated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few trees had been charred by the flames, and two died. But the efforts had paid off. &quot;Finally,&quot; Kean said, &quot;we were able to get in there and see that, thank goodness, the trees were saved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says they knew they had to do everything they could to save the Wollemi groves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are the only living Wollemi pines found anywhere on the planet in their natural environment. These pines used to cover the whole of Australia. Now they're only found in a very small and secret location in New South Wales.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right: The exact location of the trees is a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/news/fire-fighting-mission-saves-prehistoric-pines&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the trees' long-term survival depends on keeping their location confidential and on the public's cooperation in not attempting to visit them. Visitors could introduce disease and might trample regenerating plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kean thanked the firefighters for their efforts and acknowledged that while fire season isn't new, it's getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll always have bush fires in this country. There's no doubt about that. But there's no doubt also that the severity of this year's bush fires is not like anything we've ever seen. And that's due to climate change,&quot; Kean said. &quot;There's a huge opportunity for us to lead the way in terms of tackling climate change and help the rest of the world decarbonize. There's no better country on the planet better placed to do that than Australia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities will study the species' response to the fires to shape the response strategy in the future — a future in which fire will continue to threaten fragile ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft’s quest to go ‘carbon negative’ inspires $1B fund</title>
<link>https://www.greenbiz.com/article/microsofts-quest-go-carbon-negative-inspires-1b-fund</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.greenbiz.com/article/microsofts-quest-go-carbon-negative-inspires-1b-fund</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the scope of the climate crisis, Microsoft no longer believes it’s enough to be carbon neutral.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That philosophy is reflected in the software giant’s bold new pledge to become &quot;carbon negative&quot; within the next 10 years, with a stretch goal to remove all of the carbon it has emitted &quot;either directly or by electrical consumption&quot; since the company was co-founded by Bill Gates and the late Paul Allen back in 1975. Not only is it unusual for companies to focus on past carbon debt in their removal strategies, it’s a pretty tall order when you consider that Microsoft expects to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the company is putting $1 billion into a new investment fund meant to accelerate carbon reduction, capture and removal technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new commitments, outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/climate/&quot;&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday by Microsoft President Brad Smith, also will see the company extend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/microsoft-doubles-carbon-fee-it-doubles-down-ambition&quot;&gt;internal carbon fee&lt;/a&gt; it already charges business divisions to cover not just those contributed by direct operations plus those related to electricity and power consumption (Scope 1 and Scope 2) but also to reflect those generated by the company's supply and value chains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that measure, effective July 1, the beginning of the company’s fiscal year, Microsoft will bill individual business units for all Scope 3 emissions (not just those related to travel, which it already includes as part of its calculations). Among the sorts of activities that will be subject to that fee are the impact of materials embodied in buildings, employee commuting, leased assets, the emissions associated with product manufacturing by supply chain partners, the footprint associated with the use of its various products and services and so forth. For perspective, Scope 3 activities will account for 12 million metric tons of Microsoft's carbon debt this year alone, far more than the impact of the company's direct operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pquote&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Microsoft’s current carbon fee is $15 per metric ton. Initially, it plans to charge a lower price for Scope 3 emissions, although that amount was not disclosed. Eventually, the company will charge the same fee for all Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, according to the blog.
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we at Microsoft have worked hard to be 'carbon neutral' since 2012, our recent work has led us to conclude that this is an area where we’re far better served by humility than pride,&quot; wrote Smith in the blog. &quot;And we believe this is true not only for ourselves, but for every business and organization on the planet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, what’s in the game plan?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft defines &quot;carbon negative&quot; to mean that a company is removing more carbon dioxide emissions than it emits each year. In contrast, here’s how it defines the concept of being &quot;carbon neutral&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given common usage, companies have typically said they’re &quot;carbon neutral&quot; if they offset their emissions with payments &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; to avoid a reduction in emissions &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; remove carbon from the atmosphere. But these are two very different things. For example, one way to avoid a reduction in emissions is to pay someone not to cut down the trees on the land they own. This is a good thing, but in effect it pays someone &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do something that would have a negative impact. It doesn’t lead to planting more trees that would have a positive impact by removing carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach its new, more aggressive goal, Microsoft plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To step up its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/microsoft-has-figured-out-way-reduce-risks-associated-ppas&quot;&gt;already aggressive renewable energy procurement activities&lt;/a&gt;, so that its contracts for solar, wind and other sources are equal to the carbon-emitting electricity it uses in its data centers, building and campuses by 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To electrify its campus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/its-time-silicon-valley-start-buying-electric-commuter-buses&quot;&gt;vehicle fleet&lt;/a&gt; by 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To pursue both LEED Platinum and International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon status for the retrofits going on at its Silicon Valley and Puget Sound campuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the detailed blog about the new plan, it also will invest in a portfolio of &quot;negative emissions&quot; approaches including afforestation, reforestation and soil carbon capture; and emerging technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, as well as direct air capture systems. Microsoft’s key criteria for deciding which of these to use: scalability; affordability; commercial availability; and verifiability. For that reason, it will focus on nature-based solutions first and pivot to emerging technologies over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050, when they become more viable,&quot; Smith wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of keen interest to its suppliers, Microsoft will begin to adopt a new procurement strategy by July 2021 that motivates them to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. It has offered resources to assist with the work of getting there but did not provide details in the blog published Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe that Microsoft’s most important contribution to carbon reduction will come not from our own work alone but by helping our customers around the world reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings and with the power of data science, artificial intelligence and digital technology,&quot; Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pquote&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe that Microsoft’s most important contribution to carbon reduction will come not from our own work alone but by helping our customers around the world reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
To that end, Microsoft’s new commitments were accompanied by two product launches. The first is the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator, a business intelligence dashboard that will provide customers of its Azure cloud services with a measurement of the carbon impact of their computing workloads. Microsoft is also giving customers the option to opt for a green energy source for cloud services, through a service called Vattenhall. Both products are available.  
&lt;h3&gt;The business of carbon removal solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s plan to invest $1 billion in carbon removal technologies over the next four years underscores the burgeoning opportunity it sees for solutions in this area — both for itself and other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Climate Innovation Fund will make decisions about where to invest using the following questions as a compass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can the strategy drive &quot;meaningful decarbonization, climate resilience or other sustainability impact&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the technology accelerate current or potential solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can it help Microsoft address both its &quot;unpaid climate debt&quot; as well as future emissions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it consider climate equity in both established and emerging economies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will continue to fund the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-microsoft-and-amazon-are-making-ai-more-real&quot;&gt;AI for Earth program&lt;/a&gt;, which supports more than 450 grantees in more than 70 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About those oil and gas industry customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Microsoft’s ongoing relationships with companies in the oil and gas sector, such as Chevron and Schlumberger, have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/national-climate-action-nowhere-sight-new-corporate-ambition-beat-paris-goals&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; by both employees and activists who suggest the software company should divest those customers to accelerate the transition to a clean economy. Google and Amazon have been subject to similar criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine learning and other AI technologies,&quot; said Elizabeth Jardim, senior climate campaigner with Greenpeace. &quot;Teaming up with Exxon, BP, Chevron and others to extract more oil and gas is a major disconnect and makes the climate crisis worse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the blog, Smith doubles down on Microsoft’s position that it needs to keep working with the fossil fuels sector in order to help them evolve. &quot;Continued improvement in standards of living around the world will require more energy, not less,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It’s imperative that we enable energy companies to transition, including to renewable energy and to the development and use of negative emissions technologies like carbon capture and storage, and direct air capture.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, you can expect to see the software company become increasingly transparent about its progress on carbon removal and more vocal on matters of carbon-related public policy including the need to support more applied research on breakthrough carbon technologies, and the use of carbon markets and pricing that help customers and business make more informed decisions. It has talked about making this commitment before, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/salesforce-microsoft-apple-push-virginia-utility-use-more-renewables-less-gas&quot;&gt;lobbied before&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of things such as more progressive utility policies, so eyes will be on the company to see how it follows through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Sturcken, managing director of EDF+Business, described Microsoft's new commitment as an audacious goal. The NGO was encouraged by Microsoft's pledge to use its political might on behalf of climate-related causes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Microsoft is at the helm of what could be a new movement toward negative emissions,&quot; Sturcken said in a statement. &quot;It's a big step beyond what most companies have committed to. But to really shift the need on climate change, we need 1,000 other Microsofts to follow suit and turn rhetoric into action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU considers temporary ban on facial recognition in public spaces</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ai/eu-mulls-five-year-ban-on-facial-recognition-tech-in-public-areas-idUSKBN1ZF2QL</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ai/eu-mulls-five-year-ban-on-facial-recognition-tech-in-public-areas-idUSKBN1ZF2QL</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering banning facial recognition technology in public areas for up to five years, to give it time to work out how to prevent abuses, according to proposals seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan by the EU’s executive - set out in an 18-page white paper - comes amid a global debate about the systems driven by artificial intelligence and widely used by law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU Commission said new tough rules may have to be introduced to bolster existing regulations protecting Europeans’ privacy and data rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Building on these existing provisions, the future regulatory framework could go further and include a time-limited ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces,” the EU document said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that ban, of between three to five years, “a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the ban could be made for security projects as well as research and development, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document also suggested imposing obligations on both developers and users of artificial intelligence and that EU countries should appoint authorities to monitor the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will seek feedback on its white paper before making a final decision, officials said. EU digital and antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is expected to present her proposals next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government earlier this month announced regulatory guidelines on artificial intelligence technology aimed at limiting authorities’ overreach and urged Europe to avoid aggressive approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What DoorDash pays, after expenses, and what’s happening with tips</title>
<link>https://payup.wtf/doordash/no-free-lunch-report</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://payup.wtf/doordash/no-free-lunch-report</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Food delivery app DoorDash has grown rapidly into the national industry leader, serving all 50 states and outpacing GrubHub, Uber Eats, Postmates, and other players with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/doordash-continues-to-lead-in-the-food-delivery-wars.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an estimated 35% marketshare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a rapidly-expanding segment. The company is reportedly preparing for an IPO and has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/doordash-said-to-seek-100m-more-at-similar-valuation-to-its-12-6b-series-g/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;valued at a remarkable $12.6 billion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;DoorDash has also been the focus of a sustained controversy over a pay model which misappropriated customer tips intended for workers. Under the pay model the company employed from 2017 until the fall of 2019, each dollar of customer tip did not raise workers’ earnings by a dollar — it simply meant the company paid the worker one dollar less. The company repeatedly defended this wildly unpopular tip-swiping pay model over several waves of public controversy, finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/nyregion/doordash-tip-policy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;agreeing to change the policy in July&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and only implementing the change in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.doordash.com/update-on-new-pay-model-more-dollars-to-dashers-28454459d9a2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;September&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company’s updated pay model, analyzed in this report, includes minimum pay of just $2 per delivery job. Reportedly, tips no longer directly factor into pay rates. Pay for each job is still set through a black-box algorithm which the company claims accounts for a wide range of various factors; however, workers have no access to the details of how those factors are weighted. They are simply offered a given job which pays a given amount, which they can accept or reject. (However, if a worker rejects too many jobs too frequently, they may receive fewer job offers as a result.) Further, when a job is offered to a worker, the amount of pay from DoorDash and customer tip are combined into a single “guaranteed amount,” with no breakdown available up-front as to how much is pay and how much is tip. This continued opacity has fed much skepticism about whether the company is still somehow factoring tips into pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;DoorDash has &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.doordash.com/update-on-new-pay-model-more-dollars-to-dashers-28454459d9a2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported that the new pay model has resulted in an increase in what they pay workers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that gross earnings on the platform averages $18.54 per “active hour”. The company has declined to disclose how much of that gross amount is tips, how much is pay from the company, how many miles workers drive (and thus much much mileage expense they incur), what periods of time they consider to be part of an “active hour”, or other details and costs involved in achieving that reported level of gross earnings. However, we have been able to assemble a substantial amount of pay data directly from workers which provides a unique, independent view into what DoorDash is actually paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our analysis of more than two hundred samples of pay data provided by DoorDash workers across the country finds that DoorDash pays the average worker an astonishingly low $1.45/hour&lt;/strong&gt;, after accounting for the costs of mileage and additional payroll taxes borne by independent contractors. Nearly a third of jobs actually pay &lt;em&gt;less than $0&lt;/em&gt; after accounting for these basic expenses. Just 11% of jobs pay more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour, after expenses, and only 2% meet the standard of $15 + expenses. Further, jobs with higher tips still tend to include lower pay: the set of jobs with tips of less than $1 pay 1.8 times as much as those jobs with tips of more than $8, on a gross hourly pay basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our analysis shows that DoorDash has deployed a pay model which barely pays workers enough to cover their basic expenses — and sometimes, not even that much&lt;/strong&gt;. Workers’ only significant earnings comes not from pay by the company, but from customer tips. And customer tips still seem to have an inverse relationship with pay.&lt;/p&gt;
