<title>Microsoft pledges $500M for affordable housing in Seattle area</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/microsoft-affordable-housing-seattle.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SEATTLE — The Seattle area, home to both Microsoft and Amazon, is a potent symbol of the affordable housing crisis that has followed the explosive growth of tech hubs. Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company’s own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company’s strong finances, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/microsoft-apple-worth-how.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a sign of its resurgence&lt;/a&gt; under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The company’s stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/technology/san-francisco-business-tax-homeless.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Others plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft began researching the region’s housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area’s home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that “the region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The availability of affordable housing in the Seattle area has not kept pace with growth fueled by tech giants like Microsoft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth Fremson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That squeeze hits a range of workers. “Of course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,” Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company’s headquarters. “It is a supply problem, a market failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle’s suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/microsoft-pledges-500-million-to-help-develop-affordable-housing-in-seattle-and-on-eastside/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build “tens of thousands of units.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The initial reaction to the company’s announcement was positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There is almost no level of housing that isn’t direly needed,” said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kingcounty.gov/initiatives/affordablehousing.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/research/homelessness-rent-affordability-22247/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions — the country’s largest tech hubs — have all already crossed that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn’t work anymore,” said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon in recent years has worked closely with Mary’s Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/amazon-homeless-shelter-seattle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;is integrating a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/amazon-homeless-shelter-seattle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt; for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city’s affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google supported the City of Mountain View’s plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area it’s developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zucktown-willow-village.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;has planned&lt;/a&gt; to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,” Ms. Balducci said. “I don’t think this is wholly altruism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Mastercard will stop free trials from automatically billing you once it&amp;#039;s over</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185468/mastercard-free-trials-stop-automatic-billing-new-policy-rule</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185468/mastercard-free-trials-stop-automatic-billing-new-policy-rule</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;uEzmtC&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.mastercard.com/2019/01/16/free-trials-without-the-hassle/&quot;&gt;Mastercard&lt;/a&gt; announced a new policy today for merchants who retain your card information after you sign up for a free trial. Soon, Mastercard will require those merchants to request an official authorization for any recurring subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Whz2KS&quot;&gt;This is great news for forgetful or busy people who might not want to continue paying for a service or product that they just wanted to test out. For example, if you signed up for a new streaming service with your card info, then forgot you had the subscription, the merchant will send you an email or text notice before the next payment is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DUHcCo&quot;&gt;Once you receive the merchant’s message, you’ll find it includes the transaction amount, payment date, and merchant name, plus explicit instructions on how to cancel your trial. But it gets better: for every payment thereafter, the merchant will continue sending receipts (again, by email or text) containing the payment amount and how to cancel service — because maybe you liked the product for the first month or so, but have since decided otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2MwlkU&quot;&gt;Personally, I can think of a few scenarios where Mastercard’s new feature would have come in handy for avoiding unwanted charges. But, it’s better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Find Hidden Cameras and Spy Gear Like a Professional</title>
<link>https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/how-to-find-hidden-cameras/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/how-to-find-hidden-cameras/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is without a doubt most thorough guide to detecting hidden cameras and covert spy gear that is online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The simple strategies that we are going to show you will effectively clear most rooms for hidden cameras and bugs without having to use super expensive countersurveillance gear or an outside company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the processes and steps that we are going to show you are adopted from some of our best government agencies, where countersurveillance is of a grave concern to them, so these techniques have been tried and tested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the best part about this guide?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone can do it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post will reveal the exact step-by-step process that we use to sweep for covert spy gear and cameras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let's get started!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sweeping For Hidden Cameras &amp;amp; Devices Is Becoming A Necessity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just in the past couple of years, we have seen a rise in hidden cameras and spy gear being used in nefarious ways, targeting guests that stay on cruise lines, in hotel rooms, Airbnb houses, the list goes on. Unfortunately, this trend does not seem to be going away anytime soon, but you can, however, take measures to ensure that you are not a victim. In this post, we will show you exactly how to do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What Type of Device Could Be Used Against Me?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before sweeping the room in question, you should first try to determine what type of surveillance equipment, if any, would be used against you in your specific situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/what_kind_of_gear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Probability of finding a Hidden camera&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, if you find yourself staying at a bed and breakfast or a hotel, you would most likely find surveillance equipment that would utilize video to capture compromising clips or photos of the occupants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are in a business meeting environment like a conference room, you could assume that the intelligence being gathered would encompass important conversations and interactions between parties. The most likely device to be used in this situation and environment would be an audio recorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When sweeping a room for surveillance equipment, Keep this in the back of your mind and pay close attention to the areas of the room that are the most vulnerable and compromising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
     
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Break Your Bug Sweep Down Into These Steps:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                       
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 1: Enter The Room Assuming You Are Under Surveillance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If this is your first time staying in a new hotel or an Airbnb, automatically assume that you are currently being recorded and surveilled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But relax! No need to panic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odds are in your favor that you are not being monitored, but you still want to sweep your location to be 100% sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/chances.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Probability of finding a Hidden camera&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of it like riding in a vehicle and putting your seatbelt on. Chances are you won't need it, but you will be glad you put it on if you do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it is always best to just assume you are being recorded until you are 100% certain the room is clear of all surveillance equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
       
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2: Split The Room Into Quadrants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start off by standing in the center of the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, split the room into quadrants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have identified your quadrants and your start points, go through each quadrant one at a time and clear it, using the techniques in this guide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Splitting the room into sections will help you to systematically and meticulously go through the room and clear each section without skipping over any of the fine details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/quad_22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using quadrant method to find Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
                         
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3: Start Off By Making Basic Observations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perform a general scan and pay attention to anything that looks out of place or appears suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there duplicate items in the room? Such as clocks, smoke detectors or coffee pots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any unusual holes in the walls or ceiling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any of the items in the room positioned in an unusual way?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check all of the appliances like televisions, clocks, phones, hair dryers, and coffee pots for exposed wiring, suspicious lights, or anything that looks abnormal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/look_around.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Look around for hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 4: Check Every Outlet And Identify What Is Plugged Into Each Socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All surveillance devices require a power source; whether that power source is powered by an electrical outlet or a wireless battery may depend on how long you are expected to occupy the room and if the perpetrator has access to your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Devices that run on batteries have limited lifespans, however, those that run on electrical power can be used for constant and long-term surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conduct a sweep of the outlets and identify everything that is plugged into them. Pay close attention to anything plugged in that may seem out of place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/plugs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using quadrant method to find Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What About Video Surveillance And Audio Recorders?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any type of video surveillance device would be positioned in a way that would provide the best opportunity to capture footage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a video surveillance device would be aimed at the bathroom, in front of the dresser where one would get changed, or aimed at the bed. It is important to be aware of all choke points or high traffic areas in the room that would force occupants to take a certain path or occupy a certain area in the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some areas to pay attention to are the bathroom door, the front door, and all hallways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/choke_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chokepoints for Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to pay special attention to locations where conversations would take place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If someone wanted to plant surveillance equipment in a room with the specific intent of capturing crystal clear audio of a conversation between parties, they would place the device(s) in any area people are expected to gather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some areas to pay close attention to are beds, tables, couches, chairs, desks, and balconies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objects Or Amenities That Could Be Vulnerable To Surveillance Equipment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do the devices and appliances in your room match the other devices and appliances in the rest of the room or house?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any of them placed in peculiar positions or locations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are these devices different from room to room?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always keep an eye out for smoke detectors, thermostats, outlets, fixtures, and bulbs. Normally, common sense would suggest these devices should all match and remain relatively similar since they are usually original to the construction of the room or building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/sockets.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden cameras sockets&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;5px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could suggest an anomaly that should be inspected further. More importantly, are there similar devices found from room to room that are placed in peculiar positions or locations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could also suggest an anomaly that should be inspected further. During your sweep, you should always ask yourself these questions and inspect further if warranted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does the artwork in the room match the décor or the theme of the room or house you are occupying?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is more common than not for hotels and rented rooms to have a common theme or décor pattern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a modern hotel would have mostly modern décor, fixtures, furniture, and appliances. A rustic Bed and Breakfast might have older furniture with an old world charm. Keep an eye out for fixtures and pieces of décor that seem out of place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/beach_pictures.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden camera beach pictures&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;5px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;span/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Know The Ammenties That Are Offered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is always recommended to be very knowledgeable and aware of the services and amenities of the location you are staying in and compare those standards to the devices and appliances in your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, if the room is listed to have one coffee pot, but you see two in your room, inspect them both for anomalies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If coffee is offered downstairs, is the coffee pot in your room supposed to be there?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you see more than one clock in your room?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most websites will list expected room amenities and devices, but you can always call the front desk and ask if you are unsure of what devices and amenities should be in your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/hotel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden amenities&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your room has ceiling tiles, are they part of a drop ceiling system or are they build into the ceiling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any holes in them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do any of the tiles seem to stick out above the others or sit differently?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your room has a drop ceiling where the ceiling tiles can easily be pushed up, inspect them and make sure there are not any surveillance devices hidden above them if you are suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check The Mirrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is always recommended to inspect every mirror in your room to ensure it is not a two-way mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way to check for a two-way mirror is by using your fingertip. On most mirrors, if you place your fingertip on the mirror, the reflection of it will not touch. Instead, it will leave a quarter inch gap or so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/mirror_good.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; mirror without spy camera&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you put your fingertip on the mirror and the reflection is touching your finger, you should inspect it further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/mirror_caution.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; mirror with spy camera&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to note that some establishments like bars or gas stations may use a metal back with a mirror tint instead of using a real mirror, which will give the appearance of it being a 2 way mirror. This is meant to prevent the mirror from shattering and becoming a liability for the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another technique is to shut off the lights and shine a flashlight through the mirror to see if there is anything behind it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's Take A Deeper Look:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have completed a visual and physical inspection, it is suggested to take a closer look at all suspicious objects, devices, or locations, using a few countersurveillance tools that are easy to use and best of all, affordable. They will be used to find the surveillance devices that you were unable to locate with a visual inspection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 1: Purchase A Radio Frequency (RF) Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most long-term surveillance devices will need a way to transmit the information back to the surveyor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An RF detector works by scanning the area in search of devices emitting radio waves and once detected will produce an audible tone for the user that fluctuates as the device is detected closer or further away. This will continue until the user is ultimately able to locate the device emitting radio waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Commercial spy devices usually transmit in a range of 10 MHz to 8 MHz. Most RF detectors will detect them and scan from 10 hertz all the way to 24 GHz. Professional Grade RF detectors have an even broader RF range in addition to a ton of specialized features. However, these devices are expensive and could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your specific situation will determine the level of detection you would need. The average person using an RF detector to simply sweep a hotel room or an AirBnB room can get away with a simple device that will detect and locate unknown RF transmissions. You can purchase a quality &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/professional-audio-video-and-tracking-bug-detector.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RF detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, such as the one below, that will get the job done for a little over $100.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/professional-audio-video-and-tracking-bug-detector.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_11.26.02_PM.png&quot; alt=&quot; Rf detector&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2: Pick Up A Camera Lens Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RF detectors will only detect wireless devices that transmit information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about stand-alone devices that save the information to an SD card?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For that, it would be beneficial to have a camera lens detector at your disposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A camera lens detector works by detecting the reflection of light off of the lens of a recording camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When using a camera lens detector, the lens of a camera will sparkle or illuminate on the viewing screen indicating to the user that a camera may be present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are looking for an all-in-one device that has the ability to detect both RF and a camera lens, the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/lawmate-dd802-defender.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawmate Defender DD802&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would be an excellent choice. This is a professional grade device that will be very effective in detecting and locating both RF and camera lenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/lawmate-dd802-defender.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/691_00.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Rf detector with lens detector&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3: Turn Off All Emitters Before Sweeping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before beginning your sweep with an RF detector, it is important for you to ensure all devices that could possibly emit an RF signal be fully and completely powered down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be sure to power down all cell phones, Bluetooth devices, laptop computers, tablets, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also a good idea to test your RF detector before your sweep by turning it on and sweeping over your cell phone. If your RF detector is able to detect the frequency being emitted from your cell phone, it is functioning correctly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_190517783-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;electronic devices&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 4: Conduct Your Sweep &quot;Painting&quot; The Walls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pick the edge of one of your quadrants and start &quot;painting&quot; the walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Painting&quot; the walls simply means to slowly and methodically walk up and down the walls and scan them visually and with your RF detector in a painting motion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While completing this process, you should also be visually inspecting the walls looking for any sort of disturbances or unusual anomalies, while at the same time keeping an ear out for your RF detector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will paint the walls until you have reached the end of your quadrant. If nothing was detected on that pass, you should mark that quadrant clear for any transmitting devices and move to the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_507538078.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paint the walls for hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 5: &quot;Paint&quot; The Walls Using A Camera Lens Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following the same &quot;painting&quot; method as before, repeat the same process in each quadrant using your camera lens detector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 6: Turn Off The Lights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turn off the lights and look for any tiny lights that seem out of the ordinary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most spy cameras have indicator lights that will tell the user if the camera is recording or powered. If the surveyor neglected to turn these indicator lights off, you can use their mistake to your advantage by easily detecting and locating them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_382611709_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;recording lights&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 7: Use Your Phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to record video at night, most spy cameras will need some type of Infrared (IR) technology to effectively illuminate the scene digitally so that the footage being recorded is visible in complete darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;True Infrared Radiation (IR) lighting is ideal for use in covert surveillance because it is not detectable by the human eye. The visible wavelengths are from approximately 390 to 700 nm while the Infrared spectrum range is 700 nm to 1000000 nm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/em_spectrum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ir visible spectrum&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One quick and cost-effective way to detect IR light is by using the front-facing camera on your phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike the rear-facing camera, the front-facing camera does not have an IR filter and can easily pick up IR lights in the dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To try this at home, grab your TV remote, which uses IR light to send information to your TV and open the front-facing camera on your phone. Next, point the front end of the remote at the camera and press any of the remote buttons. The IR light that is normally not visible will be completely visible on your camera screen. IR light is easy to conceal and hide from unsuspecting victims of surveillance. Keep this in mind when conducting your sweep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What About Thermal Detection?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One more device to be aware of that will aid in the detection of surveillance equipment is a thermal imaging camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any type of surveillance device, whether it is video, audio, or IR, it will emit some sort of heat signature that would be easily detected with a thermal imaging device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most surveillance cameras emit a fair amount of heat due to their small size and the fact that they are normally enclosed in something discreet that does not provide much ventilation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FLIR® offers an outstanding device called the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flir.com/products/flir-one-gen-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FLIR® ONE Gen 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that connects to your smartphone and allows it to be used as a thermal imaging camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flir.com/products/flir-one-gen-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_6.41.14_PM.png&quot; alt=&quot; Flir thermal imaging&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A thermal imaging camera device like this will help you locate hot spots in the room directly on your phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you locate a hot spot behind a wall, a picture, a smoke detector, or behind any other device or location that seems unusual or peculiar, you should be able to detect the anomaly. At that time, it would be appropriate to take a closer look and inspect for surveillance devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What To Do If You Locate A Surveillance Device:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do encounter a surveillance device, do not disturb it. Immediately walk out of view of the camera and call the authorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_1044868723.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; call the police&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the newer surveillance cameras use motion detection with a loop-recording feature for the SD card. There have been quite a few cases of the perpetrator inadvertently recording themselves placing and walking away from the device because of this feature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By staying out of the camera view, you reduce the chance of recording over any of the old footage should the SD card become full. If the perpetrator did record themselves on the camera, it is obviously best to minimize the chance of that footage becoming recorded over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may ask yourself what are the legalities of a hidden camera? Check out this &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/blog-9/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; post for more info.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;American investors have lost the fiercest advocate they may have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;John Clifton Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group and a crusader for investors’ rights for more than three decades, died in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on Wednesday at age 89. The company announced Mr. Bogle’s death. &lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If all investors had heeded his ideas, they would be hundreds of billions of dollars better off than they are now,” financier Warren Buffett told The Wall Street Journal in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Through the sheer force of his will, Mr. Bogle, known as Jack, almost singlehandedly made index funds—which hold virtually every security in a given market—a practical and popular option for institutional and individual investors alike. He created the first mutual fund tied to an index in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Jack Bogle made an impact on not only the entire investment industry, but more importantly, on the lives of countless individuals saving for their futures or their children’s futures,” Vanguard Chief Executive Tim Buckley said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Under Mr. Bogle, who retired as Vanguard’s chief executive in 1996, Vanguard continually cut the costs of investing, eventually stoking a fee war that roiled an entire industry and created a money-management giant in the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. Vanguard is now the second-largest asset manager in the world, with $4.9 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;His campaign to cut fees put Mr. Bogle squarely into an American tradition of iconoclastic discounters like Henry Ford of Ford Motor, Sam Walton of Walmart and Michael Dell of Dell Inc.—men who built giant companies by selling directly to the consumer at rock-bottom prices.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;By putting the ability to own a stake in the entire stock market into the hands of any investor who could scrape together what was for many years Vanguard’s required account minimum of $3,000, Mr. Bogle helped democratize financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;inline&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetRichText&amp;#10;          inline&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetRichText&amp;#10;            article__inset--inline&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
    	

&lt;h4&gt;From the Archive&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Holders of index funds can match the market for a fraction of the cost of traditional funds. The resulting savings—billions of dollars a year—have gone straight into investors’ own pockets. Vanguard’s asset-weighted average fee has fallen in the past 20 years to 0.10% from 0.27%, according to






            &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/MORN&quot;&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


      Many traditional funds still demand 1% or more. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle was alone among mutual-fund leaders in having his own groupies—a following of investors who are dedicated to his principles of low-cost, long-term investing. Members of an official group of these fans call themselves “Bogleheads.” In a speech in 2005, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson praised Mr. Bogle’s creation of the retail index fund as equal in importance to “the invention of the wheel, wine and cheese, the alphabet and Gutenberg printing.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle’s championing of index funds may also have had unintended negative consequences. By enabling anyone to own a broad swath of the market at minimal cost, some critics say index portfolios—especially in the form of exchange-traded funds—may have encouraged excessive trading, higher volatility and a lower sensitivity to the risk of overvaluation. ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Born in Montclair, N.J., on May 8, 1929, Mr. Bogle and his twin brother David arrived five months before the Great Crash that began that October wiped out much of their family’s wealth. Mr. Bogle delivered papers and worked as a waiter growing up.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At Blair Academy and Princeton University, Mr. Bogle said he initially struggled with the subject of economics. An article about the mutual-fund industry in the December 1949 issue of Fortune magazine inspired his 1951 senior thesis, titled “The Economic Role of the Investment Company.” He graduated from Princeton &lt;em&gt;magna cum laude &lt;/em&gt;in economics.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle’s first job in the investment world was as a clerk to Walter L. Morgan, who founded the first-ever balanced mutual fund at Wellington Management.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Despite his eventual advocacy for index funds, Mr. Bogle was contemptuous early in his career of the idea that trying to beat the market was a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In 1960, under the pen name John B. Armstrong, he wrote a lengthy article for the Financial Analysts Journal in which he ridiculed the very idea “that the mutual fund itself should buy the market average,” or settle for a return no better than that of a benchmark like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. In 1973, he gave a speech insisting that “the average individual is getting ‘above-index’ results in mutual funds” and that “neither compensation of salesmen, nor profitability of broker-dealers and underwriters, is excessive.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Only after he was fired as Wellington’s president in 1974 by his partners and launched Vanguard as an independent company the following year did Mr. Bogle challenge the industry’s prevailing orthodoxy that price was a signal of quality and embrace low-cost investing.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle chose to organize Vanguard as a mutual company, an idea he said he had unsuccessfully pitched to his Wellington colleagues years earlier. Along the lines of a consumer cooperative, the firm would be—and still is—owned not by private shareholders who seek to maximize their own profits but rather by its fund investors, who earn higher returns as Vanguard drives costs lower. In 1977, Vanguard also went “no-load,” eliminating the sales commissions and all middlemen on its funds. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle’s insistence on integrity, which often struck many of his competitors as sanctimonious, steered Vanguard clear of the scandals that periodically swept through the mutual-fund industry. Still, when it came to corporate governance, Mr. Bogle became a greater proponent of index and other funds harnessing their power on shareholder votes after his tenure at Vanguard than he was during it. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At Vanguard, Mr. Bogle paid himself well but not lavishly, though he and other firm executives have never publicly disclosed those figures. Mr. Bogle frowned on ostentation, driving a Volvo station wagon, vacationing in Lake Placid, N.Y., flying economy class and haggling for discounts at hotels.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Vanguard continues to take a similarly thrifty approach to its business at its Malvern campus, whose plain brick buildings bear the names of warships. Mr. Bogle, a fan of British Adm. Horatio Nelson, named the firm Vanguard after Adm. Nelson’s ship in the 1798 Battle of the Nile and referred to employees as “crew.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Despite Mr. Bogle’s age and lengthy career, he had chronic coronary failure and suffered at least seven heart attacks—the first at age 31. He endured a malfunctioning pacemaker before finally receiving a heart transplant in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think about [dying],” he told an interviewer in 2007. “I just got on with what needed to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Networking on AWS</title>
<link>https://grahamlyons.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-networking-on-aws</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://grahamlyons.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-networking-on-aws</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I’m not a network engineer and never have been - a tame network engineer has been consulted to ensure factual and terminological accuracy. The following is an in-exhaustive run down of everything I’ve learnt from building and using network infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. If you find you have no reference point for this information then have a poke around the “VPC” section of the AWS control panel (or get in touch to tell me I’m talking nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;parts-of-a-network-you-should-know-about&quot;&gt;Parts of a Network You Should Know About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re running infrastructure and applications on AWS then you will encounter all of these things. They’re not the only parts of a network setup but they are, in my experience, the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vpc&quot;&gt;VPC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual private cloud - VPC - is a private network space in which you can run your infrastructure. It has an address space (CIDR range) which you choose e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;. This determines how many IP addresses you can assign within the VPC. Each server you create inside the VPC will need an IP address so this address space defines the limit of how many resources you can have within the network. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt; address space can use the addresses from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.255.255&lt;/code&gt;, which is 65,536 IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VPC is the basis of your network on AWS and all new accounts include a default VPC with a subnets in each availability zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---------------+
|     VPC       |     The Internet
|               |
|               |
|  10.0.0.0/16  |
|               |
|               |
+---------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;subnets&quot;&gt;Subnets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subnet is a section of your VPC, with its own CIDR range and rules on how traffic can flow. Its CIDR range has to be a subset of the VPC’s, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.1.0/24&lt;/code&gt; which would allow for IPs from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.1.0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.1.255&lt;/code&gt; giving 256 possible IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnets are often denominated as ‘public’ or ‘private’ depending on whether traffic can reach them from outside the VPC (the Internet). This visibility is controlled by the traffic routing rules and each subnet can have its own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subnet has to be in a specific availability zone within a region so it’s good practice to have a subnet in each zone. If you plan to have public and private subnets then there should be one of each per availability zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+---------------------------+
|            VPC            |
|                           |
+------------+ +------------+
||  Subnet 1 | |  Subnet 2 ||
||10.0.1.0/24| |10.0.2.0/24||
||           | |           ||
|------------+ +------------|
+---------------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;availability-zones&quot;&gt;Availability Zones&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve said that there should be subnets per availability zone, but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each AWS region is divided into 2 or more different zones which, between them, aim to guarantee a very high level of availability for that region. Essentially, at least one zone should be able to operate, even if others suffer outages (:fire:).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+----------+          +----------+
|us-ea)t-1a|          |us-east-1b|
|_____(____|          |__________|
|     )    |          |          |
|   ( &amp;amp;()  |          |    ✔     |
|  ) () &amp;amp;( |          |    8-)   |
+----------+          +----------+
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;routing-tables&quot;&gt;Routing Tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A routing table contains rules about how IP packets in the subnets can travel to different IP addresses. There is always a default route table which will only allow traffic to travel locally, within the VPC. If a subnet has no routing table associated with it then it uses the default one. These would be ‘private’ subnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want external traffic to be able to get to a subnet then you need to create a routing table with a rule explicitly allowing this. Subnets associated to that routing table would be ‘public’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the subnets in the default VPCs are associated with a route table which makes them public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-gateways&quot;&gt;Internet Gateways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The routing table which makes a subnet public needs to reference an Internet gateway to allow the flow of external IP packets into and out of the VPC. You create your Internet gateway and then create a rule which says that packets to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0/0&lt;/code&gt; - all IP addresses - need to go to there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;          Route table
         +-------------------+
         | 10.0.0.0/8: local | Requests within the VPC go over local connections.
      +--+ 0.0.0.0/0: ig-123 | Requests to any other IPs go via the Internet Gateway.
      |  |                   |

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nat-gateways&quot;&gt;NAT Gateways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an EC2 instance in a private subnet - one which doesn’t allow traffic from the Internet to reach it - then there’s also no way for IP packets to reach the Internet. We need a mechanism for sending those packets out, and then routing the replies correctly. This is called network address translation and is very likely done in your house by your wifi router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NAT gateway is a device which sits in the public subnets, accepts any IP packets bound for the Internet coming from the private subnets, sends those packets on to their destination and then sends the returning packets back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not necessary to have NAT gateways if you don’t intend instances in your private subnets to talk outside if your VPC but if you do need to do that e.g. using an external API, SaaS database etc. then you can simply set up an EC2 instance (might be cheaper, depending on your traffic), configured appropriately, or use an AWS managed NAT gateway resource (will be easier to manage because you won’t be doing it).&lt;/p&gt;

  |  Private Subnet      +----+  10.0.0.0/16: local |

  |                      |    +---------------------+
  +----------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The public subnet contains the NAT gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request is made from the private subnet to an IP address somewhere on the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The route table says that it needs to go to the NAT gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NAT gateway sends it on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-groups&quot;&gt;Security Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPC network Security groups denote what traffic can flow to (and from) EC2 instances within your VPC. A security groups can specify ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic rules, limiting them to certain sources (inbound) and destinations (outbound). They are associated with EC2 instances rather than subnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default all traffic is allowed out, but no traffic is allowed in. Inbound rules can specify a source address - either a CIDR block or another security group - and a port range. When the source is another security group then that must be within the same VPC. For example, a VPC is created with a default security group which allows traffic from anything which has that same security group. Assigning the group to everything created in the VPC (not necessarily the most secure practice) means that all those resources can talk to each another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                   +---------------+
                   | sg-abcde      |
                   | ALLOW TCP 443 |
                   +----+----------+
                         |
                    +----+------+
                    |  i-67890  |
 10.0.1.123:22      |           | 10.0.1.123:443

                    |           |
                    +-----------+
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An instance (i-67890) has a security group (sg-abcde) which allows TCP traffic on port 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request is made to its IP address (10.0.1.123) on port 22 which doesn’t get through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request is made to port 443 on the instance and the traffic is allowed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it All Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete picture of your virtual private network looks something like the picture below, with public and private subnets spread across availability zones, network address translation sitting in the public subnets and route tables to specify how packets are routed. EC2 instances are run in any subnet and have security groups attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;👋 I am Max, the technical co-founder of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://spectrum.chat&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. Spectrum is an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; chat app for large online communities and was recently acquired by GitHub. We are a team of three with a predominantly frontend and design background and have worked on it for close to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, here are the technology choices I regret and the lessons I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 font-family=&quot;system&quot; font-size=&quot;4&quot; font-weight=&quot;bold&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat sc-bxivhb jnjCzu&quot;&gt;Regret 1: Not using react-native-web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;A big part of Spectrum's appeal is that the content is public and search-indexed, which is why we built the website before native apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;12.356037151703&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Although the search-indexing was a success, our users have been requesting a better mobile experience. We are building native apps now, but starting from scratch is time consuming. If we had used &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;react-native-web&lt;/a&gt; to build the website, we could have reused the base components and built the native apps much faster! 🏎💨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;On top of that, we should have also optimised the website for mobile first. A great mobile experience on desktop is bearable and only needs tweaking to work well. However, a desktop experience on mobile is annoying, no matter how great, and it has proven hard to make ours work well on devices of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 font-family=&quot;system&quot; font-size=&quot;4&quot; font-weight=&quot;bold&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat sc-bxivhb jnjCzu&quot;&gt;Regret 2: Not using Next.js&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;We needed server-side rendering for SEO purposes (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/985188986414161921&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;client-side rendering does not cut it&lt;/a&gt;) but had already built a first version of the app with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;create-react-app&lt;/a&gt;. We thought about switching to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://nextjs.org&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt;, but I decided that reworking the routing and data fetching would be more effort than building our own server-side rendering server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Turns out, building your own production-ready SSR setup is tough. It takes a lot of work and it is difficult to provide a good experience, for both developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;9.5390625&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Next.js offers an amazing development experience and fast performance out of the box, not to mention the great community and excellent documentation. I would use it in a heartbeat if we started over today (in fact, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mxstbr/mxstbr.com&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;this website is built with Next.js&lt;/a&gt; 😍).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 font-family=&quot;system&quot; font-size=&quot;4&quot; font-weight=&quot;bold&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat sc-bxivhb jnjCzu&quot;&gt;Regret 3: Using RethinkDB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;8.2592592592593&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;I chose &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.rethinkdb.com&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;RethinkDB&lt;/a&gt; as our primary data store mainly because of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;changefeeds&lt;/a&gt;. They allow you to listen to live updates on (almost) any query. I thought this would reduce complexity by avoiding a separate PubSub system for real-time functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, we have had a lot of troubles with RethinkDB. Since it is not widely used, there is little documentation and knowledge about operations. We have had many database outages and debugging them has often felt like shooting in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Paragraph__Wrapper-sc-1aswxi8-0 isRcbp&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Writing is one of the primary activities on Spectrum, so we wanted the experience to be great. I decided to replace our plaintext markdown input with a custom WYSIWYG editor based on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://draftjs.org&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa Link-sc-6v6dn7-0 doReGu sc-ifAKCX dzynlx&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Draft.js&lt;/a&gt;, which had recently been released by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p font-family=&quot;serif&quot; color=&quot;#333&quot; font-size=&quot;18px&quot; class=&quot;sc-bdVaJa sc-htpNat ilvTDB&quot;&gt;Unfortunately it did not work out well. The editor is really buggy, even after months of work our users rightfully complain about it constantly. On top of that, the library makes up a majority of our JavaScript bundle size and the lack of cross-browser support means that we have to keep the plaintext input around as a fallback. 👎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I thought we needed WYSIWYG editing but did not validate it by talking to our users. Otherwise, we would have quickly realised that there was no need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloud Functions: Go 1.11 is now a supported language</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/cloud-functions-go-1-11-is-now-a-supported-language</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When you deploy your function, Cloud Functions fetches and installs the dependencies listed in your `go.mod` file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Cloud Functions, you can build serverless application backends, real-time data processing pipelines, chatbots, and video or image analysis tools, just to name a few. Now, you can also use the familiar building blocks of Go to build out your Cloud Functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We're continuously making improvements to Cloud Functions. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var&quot;&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt; are now generally available and we added &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/function-identity#per-function_identity&quot;&gt;new IAM security controls&lt;/a&gt;. We hope you're excited to try the Go runtime. To get started, check out the Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart&quot;&gt;quickstart&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>The Route of a Text Message</title>
<link>https://scottbot.net/the-route-of-a-text-message/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://scottbot.net/the-route-of-a-text-message/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third post in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottbot.net/tag/full-stack-dev/&quot;&gt;full-stack dev&lt;/a&gt; (f-s d) series on the secret life of data. This installment is about a single text message: how it was typed, stored, sent, received, and displayed. I sprinkle in some history and context to break up the alphabet soup of protocols, but though the piece gets technical, it should all be easily understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two installments of this series are &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottbot.net/cetus/&quot;&gt;Cetus&lt;/a&gt;, about the propagation of errors in a 17th century spreadsheet, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottbot.net/down-the-rabbit-hole/&quot;&gt;Down the Rabbit Hole&lt;/a&gt;, about the insane lengths one occasionally needs to go through to track down the source of a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Love Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My leg involuntarily twitches with vibration—was it my phone, or just a phantom feeling?—and a quick inspection reveals a blinking blue notification. “I love you”, my wife texted me. I walk downstairs to wish her goodnight, because I know the difference between the message and &lt;em&gt;the message&lt;/em&gt;, you know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit like encryption, or maybe steganography: anyone can see the text, but only I can decode the hidden data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My translation, if we’re being honest, is just one extra link in a remarkably long chain of data events, all to send a message (“come downstairs and say goodnight”) in under five seconds across about 40 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message presumably began somewhere in my wife’s brain and somehow ended up in her thumbs, but that’s a signal for a different story. Ours begins as her thumb taps a translucent screen, one letter at a time, and ends as light strikes my retinas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each tap, a small electrical current passes from the screen to her hand. Because electricity flows easily through human bodies, sensors on the phone register a change in voltage wherever her thumb presses against the screen. But the world is messy, and the phone senses random fluctuations in voltage across the rest of the screen, too, so an algorithm determines the biggest, thumbiest-looking voltage fluctuations and assumes that’s where she intended to press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NlsLmOO0Q1v8hLg6yRk-ted8dNx1BN7ZcHjDyaDdR0mHBb-XVL0zUwISiIrXXulr882BXgZBWBEXJuW1x7yFzU3yQMTepoNicbU7VdiNVNQ6yoZtkV-GnFv798-F5dilBYAO3oKR&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 0. Capacitive touch.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she starts tap-tap-tapping on the keyboard, one letter at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I-&lt;em&gt;spacebar&lt;/em&gt;-l-o-v-e-&lt;em&gt;spacebar&lt;/em&gt;-y-o-u.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s not a keyboard swiper (I am, but somehow she still types faster than me). The phone reliably records the (x,y) coordinates of each thumbprint and aligns it with the coordinates of each key on the screen. It’s harder than you think; sometimes her thumb slips, yet somehow the phone realizes she’s not trying to swipe, that it was just a messy press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the metal guts of the device, an algorithm tests whether each thumb-shaped voltage disruption moves more that a certain number of pixels, called &lt;em&gt;touch slop&lt;/em&gt;. If the movement is sufficiently small, the phone registers a keypress rather than a swipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Android’s code for detecting ‘touch slop’. Notice the developers had my wife’s gender in mind.
&lt;p&gt;She finishes her message, a measly 10 characters of her allotted 160.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allotment of 160 characters is a carefully chosen number, if you believe the legend: In 1984, German telephone engineer Friedhelm Hillebrand sat at his typewriter and wrote as many random sentences as came to his mind. His team then looked at postcards and telex messages, and noticed most fell below 160 characters. “Eureka!”, they presumably yelled in German, before setting the character limit of text messages in stone for the next three-plus decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legends rarely tell the whole story, and the legend of SMS is no exception. Hillebrand and his team hoped to relay messages over a secondary channel that phones were already using to exchange basic information with their local stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signalling System no. 7 (SS7) are a set of protocols used by cell phones to stay in constant contact with their local tower; they need this continuous connection to know when to ring, to get basic location tracking, to check for voicemail, and communicate other non-internet reliant messages. Since the protocol’s creation in 1980, it had a hard limit of 279 bytes of information. If Hillebrand wanted text messages to piggyback on the SS7 protocol, he had to deal with this pretty severe limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, 279 bytes equals 279 characters. A byte is eight bits (each bit is a 0 or 1), and in common encodings, a single letter is equivalent to eight 0s and 1s in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘A’ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
0100 0001
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘B’ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
0100 0010
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘C’ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
0100 0011
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, getting messages across the SS7 protocol isn’t a simple matter of sending 2,232 (that’s 279 bytes at 8 bits each) 0s or 1s through radio signals from my phone to yours. Part of that 279-byte signal needs to contain your phone number, and part of it needs to contain my phone number. Part of it needs to let the cell tower know “hey, this is a message, not a call, don’t ring the phone!”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Hillebrand and his team finished cramming all the necessary contextual bits into the 279-byte signal, they were left with only enough space for 140 characters at 1 byte (8 bits) a piece, or 1,120 bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if they could encode a character in only 7 bits? At 7 bits per character, they could squeeze 160 (1,140 / 7 = 160) characters into each SMS, but those extra twenty characters demanded a sacrifice: fewer possible letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 8-bit encoding allows 256 possible characters: lowercase ‘a’ takes up one possible space, uppercase ‘A’ another space, a period takes up a third space, an ‘@’ symbol takes up a fourth space, a line break takes up a fifth space, and so on up to 256. To squeeze an alphabet down to 7 bits, you need to remove some possible characters: the 1/2 symbol (½), the degree symbol (°), the pi symbol (π), and so on. But assuming people will never use those symbols in text messages (a poor assumption, to be sure), this allowed Hillebrand and his colleagues to stuff 160 characters into a 140-byte space, which in turn fit neatly into a 279-byte SS7 signal: exactly the number of characters they claim to have discovered was the perfect length of a message. (A bit like the miracle of Hanukkah, if you ask me.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The GSM-7 character set.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there my wife is, typing “I love you” into a text message, all the while the phone converts those letters into this 7-bit encoding scheme, called GSM-7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I” (notice it’s at the intersection of &lt;em&gt;4x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;x9&lt;/em&gt; above) =&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spacebar (notice it’s at the intersection of &lt;em&gt;2x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;x0&lt;/em&gt; above) =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“l” =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“o” =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
6F
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so on down the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, her slim message becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
49 20 6C 6F 76 65 20 79 6F 75 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(10 bytes combined). Each two-character code, called a &lt;em&gt;hex code&lt;/em&gt;, is one 8-bit chunk, and together it spells “I love you”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is actually not how the message is stored on her phone. It has to convert the 8-bit text to 7-bit hex codes, which it does by essentially borrowing the remaining bit at the end of every byte. The math is a bit more &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20081017024616/http://www.dreamfabric.com:80/sms/hello.html&quot;&gt;complicated&lt;/a&gt; than is worth getting into here, but the resulting message appears as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
49 10 FB 6D 2F 83 F2 EF 3A 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(9 bytes in all) in her phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife finally finishes her message (it takes only a few seconds), she presses ‘send’ and a host of tiny angels retrieve the encoded message, flutter their invisible wings the 40 feet up to the office, and place it gently into my phone. The process isn’t entirely frictionless, which is why my phone vibrates lightly upon delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called “telecommunication engineers” will tell you a different story, and for the sake of completeness I’ll relay it to you, but I wouldn’t trust them if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineers would say that, when the phone senses voltage fluctuations over the ‘send’ button, it sends the encoded message to the SIM card (that tiny card your cell provider puts in your phone so it knows what your phone number is), and in the process it wraps it in all sorts of useful contextual data. By the time it reaches my wife’s SIM, it goes from a 140-byte message (just the text) to a 176-byte message (text + context).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra 36 bytes are used to encode all sorts of information, seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sMclPt0j-mW8sVUshmo1tQF4OFB7TzawmLxdxphQh1srtfJ6LVZH9BxoSp8RCIf0dmMnoVnvlcl6zpf7pkiSwkDYLccpz8KwKt7Gz-UpGi0xGNM-HThLOziWNPGVtr3_Hp82OnUf&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 3. Here, bytes are called octets (8 bits). Counting all possible bytes yields 174 (10+1+1+12+1+1+7+1+140). The other two bytes are reserved for some SIM card bookkeeping.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ten bytes are reserved for the telephone number (service center address, or SCA) of the SMS service center (SMSC), tasked with receiving, storing, forwarding, and delivering text messages. It’s essentially a switchboard: my wife’s phone sends out a signal to the local cell tower and gives it the number of the SMSC, which forwards her text message from the tower to the SMSC. The SMSC, which in our case is operated by AT&amp;amp;T, routes the text to the mobile station nearest to my phone. Because I’m sitting three rooms away from my wife, the text just bounces back to the same mobile station, and then to my phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U-8uwEgJzETkO5-v0moohHGtYNba-PN-Kz4CsTRdt1S0RJvs-aTh4Qqh5lf048oNIMboekQaEBd5k_Edxp5BzvbB5zx6hIuTcqDf9rjPd-B3D0U1K2CxhXzovUe_1gfp6kxh-Gd7&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 4. SMS cellular network&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next byte (PDU-type) encodes some basic housekeeping on how the phone should interpret the message, including whether it was sent successfully, whether the carrier requests a status report, and (importantly) whether this is a single text or part of a string of connected messages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The byte after the PDU-Type is the message reference (MR). It’s a number between 1 and 255, and is essentially used as a short-term ID number to let the phone and the carrier know which text message it’s dealing with. In my wife’s case the number is set to 0, because her phone has its own message ID system independent of this particular file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next twelve bytes or so are reserved for the recipient’s phone number, called the destination address (DA). With the exception of the 7-bit letter character encoding I mentioned earlier, that helps us stuff 160 letters into a 140-character space, the phone number encoding is the stupidest, most confusing bits you’ll encounter in this SMS. It’s called reverse nibble notation, and it reverses every other digit in a large number. (Get it? Part of a byte is a nibble, hahahahaha, nobody’s laughing, engineers.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My number, which is usually 1-352-537-8376, is logged in my wife’s phone as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
3125358773f6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1-3 is represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
31
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 52 is represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
25
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 53 is represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
35
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7-8 is represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
87
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 37 is represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
73
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the 6 is represented by…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
f6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the fuck did the ‘f’ come from? It means it’s the end of the phone number, but for some awful reason (again, reverse nibble notation) it’s one character before the final digit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like pig latin for numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
tIs'l ki eip galit nof runbmre.s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Edit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seangies/status/1085302529917763585&quot;&gt;Sean Gies points out&lt;/a&gt; that reverse nibble notation is an inevitable artifact of representing 4-bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness&quot;&gt;little-endian&lt;/a&gt; numbers in 8-bit chunks. That doesn’t invalidate the above description, but it does add some context for those who know what it means, and makes the decision seem more sensible.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Protocol Identifier (PID) byte is honestly, at this point, mostly wasted space. It takes about 40 possible values, and it tells the service provider how to route the message. A value of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
22 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;means my wife is sending “I love you” to a fax machine; a value of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
24 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;means she’s sending it to a voice line, somehow. Since she’s sending it as an SMS to my phone, which receives texts, the PID is set to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Like every other text sent in the modern world.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GzrQ7QoYr4YOne9hwSA_Ua0GuF-uvCeH54sUH5zUmJwpDq1zyVIw4kjKRZEtR-BrctmhUrEj99MOH9AhWy4-jUgl2i8284_7mWYUFncB3cV0WXpR5P2AnzedxGJAqRftSLPRuxsG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 5. Possible PID Values&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next byte is the Data Coding Scheme (DCS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123000_123099/123038/10.00.00_60/ts_123038v100000p.pdf&quot;&gt;see this doc for details&lt;/a&gt;), which tells the carrier and the receiving phone which character encoding scheme was used. My wife used GSM-7, the 7-bit alphabet I mentioned above that allows her to stuff 160 letters into a 140-character space, but you can easily imagine someone wanting to text in Chinese, or someone texting a complex math equation (ok, maybe you can’t easily imagine that, but a guy can dream, right?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my wife’s text, the DCS byte was set to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaning she used a 7-bit alphabet, but she may have changed that value to use an 8- or 16-bit alphabet, which would allow her many more possible letters, but a much smaller space to fit them. Incidentally, this is why when you text emoji to your friend, you have fewer characters to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a little flag in the DCS byte that tells the phone whether to self-destruct the message after sending it, &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible&lt;/em&gt; style, so that’s neat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validity period (VP) space can take up to seven bytes, and sends us into another aspect of how text messages actually work. Take another look at Figure 4, above. It’s okay, I’ll wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife finally hits ‘send’, the text gets sent to the SMS Service Center (SMSC), which then routes the message to me. I’m upstairs and my phone is on, so I receive the text in a handful of seconds, but what if my phone were off? Surely my phone can’t accept a message when it’s not receiving any power, so the SMSC has to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; with the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SMSC can’t find my phone, my wife’s message will just bounce around in its system until the moment my phone reconnects, at which point it sends the text out immediately. I like to think of the SMSC continuously checking every online phone to see if its mine like a puppy waiting for its human by the door: is that smell my human? No. Is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; smell my human? No. Is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; smell my human? YESYESJUMPNOW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validity period (VP) bytes tell the carrier how long the puppy will wait before it gets bored and finds a new home. It’s either a timestamp or a duration, and it basically says “if you don’t see the recipient phone pop online in the next however-many days, just don’t bother sending it.” The default validity period for a text is 10,080 minutes, which means if it takes me more than seven days to turn my phone back on, I’ll never receive her text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s often a lot of empty space in an SMS, a few bits here or there are dedicated to letting the phone and carrier know exactly which bytes are unused. If my wife’s SIM card expects a 176-byte SMS, but because she wrote an exceptionally short message it only receives a 45-byte SMS, it may get confused and assume something broke along the way. The user data length (UDL) byte solves this problem: it relays exactly how many bytes the text in the text message actually take up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of “I love you”, the UDL claims the subsequent message is 9 bytes. You’d expect it to be 10 bytes, one for each of the 10 characters in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
I-spacebar-l-o-v-e-spacebar-y-o-u
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but because each character is 7 bits rather than 8 bits (a full byte), we’re able to shave an extra byte off in the translation. That’s because 7 bits * 10 characters = 70 bits, divided by 8 (the number of bits in a byte) = 8.75 bytes, rounded up to 9 bytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the end of every SMS: the message itself, or the UD (User Data). The message can take up to 140 bytes, though as I just mentioned, “I love you” will pack into a measly 9. Amazing how much is packed into those 9 bytes—not just the message (my wife’s presumed love for me, which is already difficult enough to compress into 0s and 1s), but also the &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; (I need to come downstairs and wish her goodnight). Those bytes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
49 10 FB 6D 2F 83 F2 EF 3A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, then, this is the text message stored on my wife’s SIM card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCA[1-10]-PDU[1]-MR[1]-DA[1-12]-DCS[1]-VP[0, 1, or 7]-UDL[1]-UD[0-140]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
00 - 11 - 00 - 07 31 25 35 87 73 F6 - ?? 00 ?? - ?? - 09 - 49 10 FB 6D 2F 83 F2 EF 3A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: to get the full message, I need to do some more digging. Alas, you only see &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the message here, hence the ??s.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow [he says in David Attenborough’s voice], the SMS must now begin its arduous journey from the SIM card to the nearest base station.  To do that, my wife’s phone must convert a string of 176 bytes to the 279 bytes readable by the SS7 protocol, convert those digital bytes to an analog radio signal, and then send those signals out into the æther at a frequency of somewhere between 800 and 2000 megahertz. That means each wave is between 6 and 14 inches from one peak to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RNm3grWjf8Ar88wrfuRcnuj1K_T2Q9DMOl3kBaOWZqCDcZ_ByF_no_WL1NUFoBUppuVcv-bjX4X78KW2iGDRXqfehRpdU1rnlyP3HT6MxKDhn2udLeV4ednGofn1ozZ-OCBMvaMl&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 6. Wavelength&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to efficiently send and receive signals, antennas should be no smaller than half the size of the radio waves they’re dealing with. If cell waves are 6 to 14 inches, their antennas need to be 3-7 inches. Now stop and think about the average height of a mobile phone, and why they never seem to get much smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through some digital gymnastics that would take entirely too long to explain, suddenly my wife’s phone shoots a 279-byte information packet containing “I love you” at the speed of light in every direction, eventually fizzling into nothing after about 30 miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before getting that far, her signal strikes the AT&amp;amp;T HSPA Base Station ID199694204 LAC21767. This base transceiver station (BTS) is about 5 blocks from my favorite bakery in Hazelwood, La Gourmandine, and though I was able to find its general location using an android app called OpenSignal, the antenna is camouflaged beyond my ability to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really fascinating bit here is that it reaches the base transceiver station at all, given everything else going on. Not only is my wife texting me “I love you” in the 1000ish mhz band of the electromagnetic spectrum; tens of thousands of other people are likely talking on the phone or texting within the 30 mile radius around my house, beyond which cell signals disintegrate. On top of that, a slew of radio and TV signals are jostling for attention in our immediate airspace, alongside visible light bouncing this way and that, to name a few of the many electromagnetic waves that seem like they ought to be getting in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qQQXTMih1A&quot;&gt;Richard Feynman eloquently put it in 1983&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a bit like the cell tower is a little blind bug resting gently atop the water on one end of a pool, and based only on the frequency and direction of waves that cause it to bounce up and down, it’s able to reconstruct who’s swimming and where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;473&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1qQQXTMih1A?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Feynman discussing waves.
&lt;p&gt;In part due to the complexity of competing signals, each base transceiver station generally can’t handle more than 200 active users (using voice or data) at a time. So “I love you” pings my local base transceiver station, about a half a mile away, and then shouts itself into the void in every direction until it fades into the noise of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Were my wife and I on different cell providers, or were we in different cities, the route of her message to me would be a good deal more circuitous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife’s message is massaged into the 279-byte SS7 channel, and sent along to the local base transceiver station (BTS) near the bakery. From there, it gets routed to the base station controller (BSC), which is the brain of not just our antenna, but several other local antennas besides. The BSC flings the text to AT&amp;amp;T Pittsburgh’s mobile switching center (MSC), which relies on the text message’s SCA (remember the service center address embedded within every SMS? That’s where this comes in) to get it to the appropriate short message service center (SMSC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alphabet soup is easier to understand with the diagram from figure 7; I just described steps 1 and 3. If my wife were on a different carrier, we’d continue through steps 4-7, because that’s where the mobile carriers all talk to each other. The SMS has to go from the SMSC to a global switchboard and then potentially bounce around the world before finding its way to my phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5PSN844ciuDUjzZnVHDSooXHrkKhvX9rjG14k_oUUffT7Xm97KOlT0dIYKPje2wY0LEr6MlXCKDkU4OaHhQlieI52s6njAZDagiIodE3eElX-UcpDCRoBgyDIHh15KgnZBVBl34y&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 7. SMS routed through a GSM network.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she’s on AT&amp;amp;T and I’m on AT&amp;amp;T, and our phones are connected to the same tower, so after step 3 the 279-byte packet of love just does an about-face and returns through the same mobile service center, through the same base station, and now to my phone instead of hers. A trip of a few dozen miles in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzzzz&lt;/em&gt;. My pocket vibrates. A notification lets me know an SMS has arrived through my nano-SIM card, a circuit board about the size of my pinky nail. Like Bilbo Baggins or any good adventurer, it changed a bit in its trip there and back again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NbA9m8nW2fHDCSlmcittyXIGl9-tDh85sAFQixng2j-aE7Hbsv9gaDk-BAtGwkWqt1CZOgsyp5C0q0CNopbREswegN3YUWQgEOm8ckis89UNfp8Cvf0Z9omyafYUKyJ7kwM3nCOH&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 8. Received message, as opposed to sent message (figure 3).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 shows the structure of the message “I love you” now stored on my phone. Comparing figures 3 and 8, we see a few differences. The SCA (phone number of the short message service center), the PDU (some mechanical housekeeping), the PID (phone-to-phone rather than, say, phone-to-fax), the DCS (character encoding scheme), the UDL (length of message), and the UD (the message itself) are all mostly the same, but the VP (the text’s expiration date), the MR (the text’s ID number), and the DA (my phone number) are missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, on my phone, there are two new pieces of information: the OA (originating address, or my wife’s phone number), and the SCTS (service center time stamp, or when my wife sent the message).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife’s phone number is stored in the same annoying reverse nibble notation (like dyslexia but for computers) that my phone number was stored in on her phone, and the timestamp is stored in the same format as the expiration date was stored in on on her phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two information inversions make perfect contextual sense. Her phone needed to reach me by a certain time at a certain address, and I now need to know who sent the message and when. Without the home address, so to speak, I wouldn’t know whether the “I love you” came from my wife or my mother, and the difference would change my interpretation of the message fairly significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In much the same way that any computer translates a stream of bytes into a series of (x,y) coordinates with specific color assignments, my phone’s screen gets the signal to render&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
49 10 FB 6D 2F 83 F2 EF 3A
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the screen in front of me as “I love you” in backlit black-and-white. It’s an interesting process, but as it’s not particularly unique to smartphones, you’ll have to look it up elsewhere. Let’s instead focus on how those instructions become points of light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friendly marketers at Samsung call my screen a Super AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode) display, which is somehow both redundant and not particularly informative, so we’ll ignore unpacking the acronym as yet another distraction, and dive right into the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 330,000 tiny sources of light, or pixels, crammed inside each of my phone screen’s 13 square inches. For that many pixels, each needs to be about 45µm (micrometers) wide: thinner than a human hair. There’s 4 million of ‘em in all packed into the palm of my hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you already know how screens work. You know that every point of light, like the Christian God or Musketeers (minus d’Artagnan), is always a three-for-one sort of deal. Red, green, and blue combine to form white light in a single pixel. Fiddle with the luminosity of each channel, and you get every color in the rainbow. And since 4 x 3 = 12, that’s 12 million tiny sources of light sitting innocently dormant behind my black mirror, waiting for me to press the power button to read my wife’s text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lyM52NvkH6b7UpTojk2SL6fo4U0sb06_R7vhKRPQ-hPL8mRurOmX1XcemN-NPYDLh8O0HCs_g8j3xDl5SUh_aq8U2Qm7J4bbZN0A5ZPv262Hs5aujULUzsYpjVlO5VBNfRI9FRxi&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 9. The subpixel array of a Samsung OLED display.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each pixel, as the acronym suggests, is an organic light-emitting diode. That’s fancy talk for an electricity sandwich:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layers aren’t too important, beyond the fact that it’s a cathode plate (negatively charged), below a layer of organic molecules (remember back to highschool: it’s just some atoms strung together with carbon), below an anode plate (positively charged).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phone wants the screen on, it sends electrons from the cathode plate to the anode plate. The sandwiched molecules intercept the energy, and in response they start emitting visible light, photons, up through the transparent anode, up through the screen, and into my waiting eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since each pixel is three points of light (red, green, and blue), there’s actually three of these sandwiches per pixel. They’re all essentially the same, except the organic molecule is switched out: poly(p-phenylene) for blue light, polythiophene for red light, and poly(p-phenylene vinylene) for green light. Because each is slightly different, they shine different colors when electrified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fun side fact: blue subpixels burn out much faster, due to a process called “exciton-polaron annihilation”, which sounds really exciting, doesn’t it?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 4 million pixels are laid out on an indexed matrix. An index works in a computer much the same way it works in a book: when my phone wants a specific pixel to light a certain color, it looks that pixel up in the index, and then sends a signal to the address it finds. &lt;em&gt;Let there be light, and there was light&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fun side fact: now you know what “Active Matrix Light-Emitting Diode” means, and you didn’t even try.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone’s operating system interprets my wife’s text message, figures out the shape of each letter, and maps those shapes to the indexed matrix. It sends just the right electric pulses through the Super AMOLED screen to render those three little words that have launched ships and vanquished curses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great strangeness here is that my eyes never see “I love you” in bright OLED lights; it appear on the screen black-on-white. The phone creates the illusion of text through negative space, washing the screen white by setting every red, green, &amp;amp; blue to maximum brightness, then turning off the bits where letters should be. Its complexity is offensively mundane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ET7St4Ie1cKCmH9Qw-pcqM_VEiPqjKSWhsxJqcQL4NBLabfceSr3OSI9hMjsqLYK1UsojdX35bMINeFrScfgXQeqnDCAAvAwLseTltg7l-JWKq97lUQ_r5Nd8H_JJE-6kYYFB0IX&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 11. Negative space.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In displaying everything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; my wife’s text message, and letting me read it in the gaps, my phone succinctly betrays the lie at the heart of the information age: that communication is &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;. Speed and ease hide a mountain of mediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that mediation isn’t just technical. My wife’s text wouldn’t have reached me had I not paid the phone bill on time, had there not been a small army of workers handling financial systems behind the scenes. Technicians keep the phone towers in working order, which they reach via a network of roads partially subsidized by federal taxes collected from hundreds of millions of Americans across 50 states. Because so many transactions still occur via mail, if the U.S. postal system collapsed tomorrow, my phone service would falter. Exploited factory workers in South America and Asia assembled parts in both our phones, and exhausted programmers renting expensive Silicon Valley closets are as-you-read-this pushing out code ensuring our phones communicate without interruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this underneath a 10-character text. A text which, let’s be honest, means much more than it says. My brain subconsciously peels back years of interactions with my wife to decode the message appearing on my phone, but between her and me there’s still a thicket of sociotechnical mediation, a stew of people and history and parts, that can never be untangled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, in the office late one Sunday night. “I love you,” my wife texted from the bedroom downstairs, before the message traversed 40 or so feet to my phone in a handful of seconds. I realize what it means: it’s time to wish her goodnight, and perhaps wrap up this essay. I tap away the last few words, now slightly more cognizant of the complex layering of miles, signals, years of history, and human sweat it took to keep my wife from having to shout upstairs that it’s about damn time I get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Christopher Warren, Vika Zafrin, and Nechama Weingart for comments on earlier drafts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop music player focused on streaming from free sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuclear.gumblert.tech&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube&quot;&gt;mps-youtube&lt;/a&gt;, this is a similar music player but with a GUI. It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-alpha release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if I am religiously opposed to using Electron for any and all purposes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you are not the target audience of this program. See mps-youtube (link above) for a similar program that will not taint your machine with a library you happen to dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an unrelated note, highly polarized opinions about languages and frameworks are characteristic of people who lack real-world programming experience and are more interested in building an identity than creating computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Searching for and playing music from youtube (including integration with playlists), bandcamp (including albums), and soundcloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching for related songs in youtube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading from youtube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching for albums (powered by last.fm and musicbrainz), album view, automatic song lookup based on artist and track name (in progress, can be dodgy sometimes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Song queue, which can be exported as a playlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading saved playlists (stored in json files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrobbling to last.fm (along with updating the 'now playing' status)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newest releases with reviews - tracks and albums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsing by genre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planned features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for local files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsing by popularity&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community-maintained packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of packages maintained by third parties. We would like to thank the maintainers for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not control these and cannot be held responsible for their contents, but if any of these appear suspicious to you, feel free to open an issue so we can reach out to the maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dev build process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop the project locally, you should only do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This launches webpack. It watches local files for changes and rebuilds the project as needed. The project also has hot reload built in. And in another terminal window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ npm run electron:dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This launches a development version of the program. Tmux is very useful here so you can keep an eye on all running processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To run production version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ npm run build:dist
$ npm run electron:prod
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build for current operating system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ npm run build:dist
$ npm run build:electron
$ npm run pack
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of &lt;code&gt;pack&lt;/code&gt; you can use &lt;code&gt;build:all&lt;/code&gt; to build for all operating systems or &lt;code&gt;build:[system]&lt;/code&gt; to build for a particular system (see package.json).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of errors with dbus/mpris, try removing optional dependencies from package.json and node_modules.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DOJ: Hackers broke into an SEC database and made millions from inside info</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors unveiled charges in an international stock-trading scheme that involved hacking into the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR corporate filing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme allegedly netted $4.1 million for fraudsters from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine. Using 157 corporate earnings announcements, the group was able to execute trades on material nonpublic information. Most of those filings were &quot;test filings,&quot; which corporations upload to the SEC's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges were announced Tuesday by Craig Carpenito, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, alongside the SEC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates financial crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme involves seven individuals and operated from May to at least October 2016. Prosecutors said the traders were part of the same group that previously hacked into newswire services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpenito, in a press conference Tuesday, said the thefts included thousands of valuable, private business documents. &quot;After hacking into the EDGAR system they stole drafts of [these] reports before the information was disseminated to the general public,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those documents included quarterly earnings, mergers and acquisitions plans and other sensitive news, and the criminals were able to view it before it was released as a public filing, thus affecting the individual companies' stock prices. The alleged hackers executed trades on the reports and also sold them to other illicit traders. One inside trader made $270,000 in a single day, according to Carpenito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers used malicious software sent via email to SEC employees. Then, after planting the software on the SEC computers, they sent the information they were able to gather from the EDGAR system to servers in Lithuania, where they either used it or distributed the data to other criminals, Carpenito said. The EDGAR service operates in New Jersey, which is why the Justice Department office in Newark was involved in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Avakian, co-head of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said the same criminals also stole advance press releases sent to three newswire services, though she didn't name the newswires. The hackers used multiple broker accounts to collect the illicit gains, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Ukrainians were charged by the Justice Department with hacking the database — Oleksandr Ieremenko and Artem Radchenko. Seven further individuals and entities were also named in a civil suit by the SEC for trading on the illicit information: Sungjin Cho, David Kwon, Igor Sabodakha, Victoria Vorochek, Ivan Olefir, Andrey Sarafanov, Capyield Systems, Ltd. (owned by Olefir) and Spirit Trade Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at the time, the incident sparked fears over the SEC's Consolidated Audit Trail database, known as CAT. The CAT was meant to record every trade and order — either stock or option — made in the U.S., with the goal of providing enough data to analyze for detecting market manipulations and other malicious behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full implementation of the CAT has been plagued by delays, with equities reporting now scheduled to begin in November. The New York Stock Exchange has asked the SEC to consider limiting the amount of data collected by the CAT, which would include data on around 58 billion daily trades, as well as the personal details of individuals making the trades, including their Social Security numbers and dates of birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2017, SEC chairman Jay Clayton announced the EDGAR database had been hacked in a lengthy statement. The commission said the database was penetrated in 2016 but the incident wasn't detected until August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cybersecurity is critical to the operations of our markets, and the risks are significant and, in many cases, systemic,&quot; Clayton said at the time. &quot;We also must recognize — in both the public and private sectors, including the SEC — that there will be intrusions, and that a key component of cyber risk management is resilience and recovery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
