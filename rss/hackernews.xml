In a checked shirt and with neatly parted hair, Clark looked more the part of a high school teacher than a corporate executive, as he cheerfully called himself “head elf of Santa’s workshop around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Of Amazon’s transformation, &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3917309278001/#sp=show-clips&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s better for everybody.” Workers no longer would have to walk massive warehouse floors to find the right power drill – instead, robots would bring the drill directly to them. The hour or more it took to process a package had been shaved down to as little as 15 minutes. More Amazon customers could now get products delivered to their door the same day they clicked “Buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The following July, Amazon rolled out another innovation: Prime Day. The holiday-shopping season was already an intense pressure cooker of warehouse activity known as “peak” inside Amazon. Now the company had just manufactured a second peak in the middle of the year: a brand-new holiday that would become pivotal to the company’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji stk-theme_41108__mb_15&quot;&gt;Indeed, in the six years since Clark stood in that cavernous warehouse and saw the future, the company’s value has leaped from less than $150 billion to more than $1 trillion, and CEO Jeff Bezos has become the richest person in the world. The company’s top leaders have fashioned a mythology around its growth, casting Amazon as a force for good. Its obsession with delighting customers fuels a “&lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/about-amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;virtuous cycle&lt;/a&gt;,” they say, that ends up benefiting everyone – even Amazon’s more than 250,000 warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In fact, as senators have fired off letters to the company and workers have led walkouts over health and safety, Amazon has engaged in an unapologetic public relations campaign. Robots, Amazon &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-innovation/what-robots-do-and-dont-do-at-amazon-fulfillment-centers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;insists&lt;/a&gt;, are good for workers. “They make the job safer,” Jeff Wilke, one of two CEOs under Bezos, told &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/jeff-wilke/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PBS FRONTLINE&lt;/a&gt; last September. And Prime Day and the holiday rush are so well orchestrated, Amazon has claimed, that injury rates stay flat or even go down during these buying frenzies. Thanks to “diligent record-keeping,” Amazon &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-describe-peak-2019-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, “we know for a fact that recordable incidents do not increase during peak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;But a new cache of company records obtained by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting – including internal safety reports and weekly injury numbers from its nationwide network of fulfillment centers – shows that company officials have profoundly misled the public and lawmakers about its record on worker safety. They reveal a mounting injury crisis at Amazon warehouses, one that is especially acute at robotic facilities and during Prime week and the holiday peak – and one that Amazon has gone to great lengths to conceal. With weekly data from 2016 through 2019 from more than 150 Amazon warehouses, the records definitively expose the brutal cost to workers of Amazon’s vast shipping empire – and the bald misrepresentations the company has deployed to hide its growing safety crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__separator_basic_divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The internal reports cheer incremental progress in a specific month or region; call out problem warehouses with the worst injury numbers; and detail safety initiatives, action items and pilot projects. While the reports show a committed drive to improve processes with technology or design changes, they don’t propose reducing the intense workload for Amazon’s warehouse employees, which is what helps drive Amazon’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;often points&lt;/a&gt; to the tens of millions of dollars it has invested to enhance safety practices. Yet Amazon’s injury rates have gone up each of the past four years, the internal data shows. In 2019, Amazon fulfillment centers recorded 14,000 serious injuries – those requiring days off or job restrictions. The overall rate of 7.7 serious injuries per 100 employees was 33% higher than in 2016 and nearly double the most recent industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The data back up the accounts of Amazon warehouse workers and former safety professionals who say the company has used the robots to ratchet up production quotas to the point that humans can’t keep up without hurting themselves. For each of the past four years, injury rates have been significantly higher at Amazon’s robotic warehouses than at its traditional sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;And for years, the internal data show, injury rates have spiked during the weeks of Prime Day and Cyber Monday, contrary to Amazon’s public claims. Those two weeks had the highest rate of serious injuries for all of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Monthly bulletins from Amazon’s environment, health and safety team show that the famously data-obsessed company is well aware of its safety problems. Each month, company officials sent out detailed updates – marked “Privileged &amp;amp; Confidential” – to warehouse safety managers across the country with data, charts and FAQs. They set safety goals and monitor progress closely. But the internal documents show that the company has failed to hit these targets. In 2018, Amazon aimed to lower its injury rate by 20%. Instead, injury rates went up. The next year, the goal was more modest: a 5% decrease. But the rate rose again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In May, Bezos told shareholders that he welcomed scrutiny of the company’s operations. “It’s good for us,” he said. “Nothing is more important,” he added, “than the health and well-being of our employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon declined Reveal’s interview request and did not respond to detailed questions about the accuracy of its public statements. Instead, a company spokesperson provided a general statement about its warehouse safety initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our teams. So far in 2020, we have committed over $1B in new investments in operations safety measures, ranging from technology investments in safety to masks, gloves, and the enhanced cleaning and sanitization required to protect employees from the spread of Covid-19,” spokesperson Rachael Lighty said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;She said the company has seen improvements through an array of programs inside its warehouses, such as installing guardrails to separate forklifts from pedestrians, increasing safety staffing and offering wellness exercises. “Our investments in safety training and education programs, in technology and new safety infrastructure are working,” Lighty said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Yet her email didn’t say how the company justifies its claim that these initiatives are working, while injury rates have continued, year after year, to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;stk-reset stk-code&quot;&gt;Amazon says its warehouses are safe for workers. But the numbers reveal that workers are getting hurt much more often than the company claims.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last year, its workers experienced the highest injury rates of any Amazon fulfillment center in the country: 22 serious injuries for every 100 workers. That’s a rate more than five times higher than the most recent industry average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Cecilia Hoyos has been at the company for nine years. She lives just a block away from BFI3, and her $17.90 hourly wage supports two children and a 1½-year-old granddaughter. Earlier this month, she spent her 56th birthday at work in the warehouse. She often talks about how much she loves her job – she likes being around people and keeping busy. “It’s just that it’s hurting me and they’re not listening to what my body’s telling me,” Hoyos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Since the warehouse opened in 2014, Hoyos has seen the production quotas go higher and higher. Managers would closely monitor a computer system that tracks how many items an employee scans every hour and write up workers who weren’t hitting targets. Workers who fell too far behind could be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Those quotas changed dramatically when the robots arrived at Amazon. Company officials promised they’d save workers such as Hoyos from the fatigue of walking miles a day to find customer orders. All they would have to do is stand in place and grab things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“We thought it was so cool,” she said. But she soon wished she were back to walking all day. Instead of greeting colleagues as she moved through the facility, she was isolated at a workstation, and standing 10 hours a day doing repetitive motions proved to be much harder on her body, Hoyos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The robots were too efficient. They could bring items so quickly that the productivity expectations for workers more than doubled, according to a former senior operations manager who saw the transformation. And they kept climbing. At the most common kind of warehouse, workers called pickers – who previously had to grab and scan about 100 items an hour – were expected to hit rates of up to 400 an hour at robotic fulfillment centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;According to Kathleen Fagan, a physician who inspected Amazon warehouses in her capacity as a medical officer for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, studies have shown that production rates have a direct impact on injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“If you’ve got robots that are moving product faster and workers have to then lift or move those products faster, there’ll be increased injuries,” she said. Doing the same motion over and over again, quickly and without a break, doesn’t allow muscles to rest. Increased physical and mental stress leads to distraction and exhaustion, which also increase injuries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24669547/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24669552/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;A former senior Amazon safety manager said that within a year or two of introducing the robots, the unintended consequences had become clear to Amazon’s safety team. “We vastly underestimated the effects it was going to have on our associates,” said the former safety manager, whom we agreed not to name because he left on good terms with the company and, overall, has a positive impression of how Amazon otherwise handled safety. “We realized early on there was an issue. It was just – you’re already moving that way at light speed, so how do you take a step back and readjust?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;As far back as December 2015, just over a year after Amazon debuted its fleet of robots, OSHA issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Amazon_1074833_eHAL.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hazard alert letter&lt;/a&gt; against an Amazon robotic warehouse in New Jersey. OSHA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region3/01122016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;called out&lt;/a&gt; Amazon for conditions that resulted from the robotics innovation: “The company exposed employees to ergonomic risk factors including stress from repeated bending at the waist and repeated exertions, and standing during entire shifts up to 10 hours, four days a week and sometimes including mandatory overtime shifts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The federal agency recommended measures – such as an extra rest break and rotating employees to different jobs throughout the day – that Amazon has yet to implement across its warehouse network. And Amazon’s data show that by the end of 2016, its robotic warehouses had significantly higher injury rates than its traditional facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Yet in May 2019, Wilke, Amazon’s co-CEO, &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffawilke/status/1132035105906577408&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet, “What some folks may not know is that the robots make those jobs better and safer.” He also said robots allow “people to take advantage of their innate human creativity instead of doing rote things over and over again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon did not respond to the finding that its robotic facilities have higher injury rates, instead reiterating its claim that “the use of robotics, automation and technology in our fulfillment centers is enhancing our workplace, making jobs safer and more efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__style_font_style-1600758096782 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Prime Day is one of Amazon’s two most crucial sales periods. Amazon Prime members get access to more than a million deals over what is now two days; workers get mandatory overtime, with shifts extended from 10 to 12 hours or extra shifts added to an already grueling job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Prime Day 2019 was the biggest shopping event in the company’s history. It was also the year’s most dangerous week for injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers, with nearly 400 serious injuries recorded across the country. Reveal calculated those numbers from Amazon’s internal data. Yet Amazon officials have publicly denied that rates spike during these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Last November, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reveal investigation&lt;/a&gt; showed that the company’s obsession with speed had turned its warehouses into injury mills. When asked about injuries during Prime Day and the holidays for that story, an Amazon spokesperson told Reveal that “the rate of injury – an average rate of injury per person – has historically decreased or been stable during these two times.” In a safety report from that same month, a line graph illustrates Amazon’s injury rates for 2019. The tallest spike is right in the middle of the year, during the week of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Just five months earlier, in June 2019, the monthly report from the Amazon safety director in charge of robotic warehouses across the country was frank about the risks. Warehouses in the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Connecticut were “expecting an increase in injuries across all sites during Prime Week.” Injuries already had increased in the ramp-up to Prime Day, a trend the report attributed to mandatory overtime and bringing in 1,200 to 2,000 seasonal employees to each robotic site in that region. Both the overtime and the influx of new workers were labeled “high-risk situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;At the time, Amazon had several safety initiatives in the works. A pilot project to do what OSHA had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Amazon_1074833_eHAL.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; years before – rotate workers to different jobs to alleviate repetitive stress – had shown promise in reducing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;But sales came first. “Despite the considerable benefits, half of the pilot sites decided to turn off sort rotation during Prime Week,” Amazon’s safety team reported in August 2019. A November report said that while the job rotation had driven down injury rates in robotic warehouses, “adherence is declining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Another pilot project, outlined in a May 2019 report, sought to lower injuries by blocking off the highest and lowest shelves on warehouse racks, “optimizing work allocation to an associate’s power zone,” so workers wouldn’t have to bend as low or reach as high. According to the report, ergonomic issues such as excessive repetition and bending down led to 74% of injuries among the workers who stowed away and picked out customer orders in robotic warehouses in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;That pilot project, however, was designed for use only “during non-Peak.” And out of six warehouses testing the pilot, five put it on hold for the runup to Prime Day. The report warned there was “risk of complete termination of (the) project.” Amazon declined to provide an update on the program’s current status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon has maintained that the company properly staffs its warehouses with safety officials. An Amazon spokesperson told me last November, “We ensure we have adequate leadership and safety staff on hand during these peak times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Yet an August 2019 report described safety staffing at robotic warehouses as being “critically low.” That October, another report again warned of staffing problems at robotic warehouses, including safety-team attrition in the region that covers New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Connecticut that “will put several sites understaffed going into Peak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;As last year’s holiday-shopping season approached, Amazon’s safety managers received talking points to pass along to workers fatigued from 12-hour shifts and 60-hour weeks. “Mandatory Extra Time,” it said, “requires us to give a little extra to stay customer obsessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“Take the time away from work to recharge your internal battery,” the list of tips suggests. “Smile and laugh with the people in your life that bring you joy. Sleep in on your day off. Binge your favorite shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji stk-theme_41108__style_font_style-1600758096782&quot;&gt;Austin Wendt left his job as an EMT for a private ambulance company in 2016 to take a higher-paying role running the first aid clinic at Amazon’s warehouse BFI3 in DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Eventually, he became the only person responsible for safety at the warehouse during his shifts. A safety specialist had quit and wasn’t replaced. His manager, he said, was rarely on-site. Overworked and overwhelmed, Wendt was being asked to do things he wasn’t trained to do, he said, such as ergonomic assessments of workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“I never had support from my boss or senior leadership, to do my job effectively or enforce safety,” he said. “There’s so much to do and you’re so far behind, and there’s so many injuries that you could just never get caught up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;He’d watch workers heave heavy bags of dog food and cat litter all night – tens of thousands of pounds in some cases, he estimated. And the workers had to do it quick. Under constant pressure to hit ever-increasing production rates, they took shortcuts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Instead of climbing a ladder to grab a heavy item off a top shelf, workers would get on their tiptoes and reach. Or they’d bend over, instead of squatting, to grab a bag, then twist to put it down quickly. They’d grab a heavy tote off a conveyor belt with one hand while pressing a button on a computer screen with the other. The extra hours, fatigue and stress of peak times compounded the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“I’d have managers sitting there watching these people work very improperly” he said, “and they don’t say anything. Because it’s about rate and productivity.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In 2018, Amazon safety officials did what they called a “deep dive” analysis into why so many workers at the DuPont warehouse gave negative feedback in a routine safety survey. To the question, “Does the safety training match the real world expectations of your job?” 36% of the site’s workers gave an “unfavorable” response. For months, that was the safety question with the worst response, and it wasn’t budging even with retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Trying to figure out why, Amazon got a common explanation from workers, according to the report: The work “requires me to move too quickly, so I am forced to either cut corners or not make rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The report said BFI3 leadership was seeking “to improve processes and ensure that they can be performed safely at rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Yet not one of the dozens of safety initiatives described in the 2018 and 2019 internal safety reports obtained by Reveal suggests slowing down production quotas to reduce injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“In the end, I don’t think it’s that hard of an issue,” Wendt said; the answer is to “lower the rate.” But, he added, “I don’t think that was ever an option in their head or even thought of as a route to take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Wendt left Amazon for a fire department job in early 2019. That year, the warehouse’s injury problem got even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Cecilia Hoyos accounted for two of the injuries on the warehouse logs that year. For one, in July 2019, the heavy lifting and repetition caught up with her. After an entire shift spent unloading a trailer – grabbing heavy boxes and putting them on a conveyor belt – she had a hard time walking to her front door. Trying not to complain, she returned to unloading trailers the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“It was killing me, but OK, that’s my job,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;After a break, Hoyos found she couldn’t walk back to her workstation. She ended up with a hip injury that put her off work for months, according to Amazon’s injury logs. That and other work injuries have left her in constant pain, she said, leaving her feeling like her 80-year-old mother when she climbs stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Hoyos said Amazon should have workers rotate jobs to lessen the repetitive strain. But managers don’t listen, she said. “They say no because they only think about the rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Warehouse leaders would, however, offer pizza parties as a reward for a streak of injury-free shifts, Wendt said – so some workers would push through the pain rather than be the person who cost their co-workers free pizza. Managers were effectively “offering rewards for not reporting injuries,” Wendt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji stk-theme_41108__style_font_style-1600758096782&quot;&gt;In February, a group of 15 U.S. senators, led by Sherrod Brown, Bernie Sanders and Tammy Baldwin, demanded that Bezos make a long list of changes in Amazon’s warehouses after Reveal’s initial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“These reports make clear that by placing such a priority on speed and quota fulfillment, your company requires employees to risk their safety and health to perform and keep their jobs,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-sanders-baldwin-demand-answers-from-amazon-as-work-related-injuries-continue-to-rise-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the letter reads&lt;/a&gt;. The senators also demanded a response from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, pushed back on the idea that the company had a worker injury problem, telling the senators that other companies underreport their injuries. “In 2016, we decided to change our approach to recordkeeping and design a system that reported all injuries – no matter the severity,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6786669-Amazon-Safety-Response-02-21-2020.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in response to the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;But the 2015 OSHA investigation of the fulfillment center in New Jersey found that Amazon had failed to record more than two dozen injuries as required, leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region3/01122016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;$7,000 fine&lt;/a&gt;. And several former Amazon safety professionals told me that the company used to systematically hide injuries by having safety staff write up “justifications” for not recording injuries that should have been counted by federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Days after the senators sent their letter, Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xoj7y2MwEo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;went on&lt;/a&gt; CNBC to talk about the company having raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour. When asked about the letter, he echoed the argument that the company’s injury rates are so high today only because it initiated a policy of zealous compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“Across the country, injuries are woefully underreported,” he said. “That was true at Amazon a number of years ago, and then we changed the way we report injuries. That spiked the numbers for us. We report well above what’s required by OSHA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Fagan helped lead that 2015 inspection as a medical officer for OSHA. She found Amazon’s on-site clinics would send injured workers back to work instead of referring them to another clinic for proper medical attention. “What we learned was really surprising, actually shocking,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-ce-tag=&quot;mask&quot; class=&quot;stk-mask&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fagan-edited.jpg&quot; data-image-id=&quot;135019&quot; alt=&quot;Portrait of Kathleen Fagan&quot; title=&quot;Kathleen Fagan, a physician who inspected Amazon warehouses as a medical officer for OSHA, found the company did not provide proper medical attention to injured workers.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fagan-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fagan-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fagan-edited.jpg 1920w&quot; data-image-name=&quot;Fagan-edited.jpg&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset stk-image&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 1200px, 100vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Fagan went on to investigate Amazon warehouses in New Jersey again and found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/12/02/amazon-warehouse-workers-safety-cyber-monday/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;same problems&lt;/a&gt; with medical care. Workers were still being discouraged from reporting injuries in 2017 and from seeking outside medical attention in 2019, Fagan found. In another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6584275-Amazon-Robbinsville-OSHA-Letter-081919.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hazard alert letter&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA criticized Amazon for explicitly allowing AmCare, Amazon’s system of on-site medical clinics, to delay sending workers to a doctor for up to 21 days. The result was that workers’ injuries got worse while they waited for proper medical care, she said. “The company did not improve,” Fagan, who has since retired, told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“I mean, that’s shameful,” she said. “This is a company that makes enormous profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon also has selectively released flattering numbers to inquiring Congress members, even when the big picture is far grimmer. Last November, after Reveal reported that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/find-out-what-injuries-are-like-at-the-amazon-warehouse-that-handled-your-packages/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2018 injury rates&lt;/a&gt; at a warehouse in Fall River, Massachusetts, were nearly triple the industry average, Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6590447-2019-12-20-Letter-to-Mr-Bezos-on-Fall-River.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to Bezos “seeking answers about why so many Massachusetts workers are getting seriously injured at Amazon fulfillment centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Huseman &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7215123-Amazon-Response-to-Warren-Markey-Kennedy-Letter.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;, “The injury data by itself does not tell the full story.” He declined to provide the 2019 annual injury numbers the lawmakers had requested, but cited one data point: The 2019 holiday peak produced a lower rate of injuries requiring time off work compared with 2018, a change he attributed to “the continuous improvement initiatives executed locally and companywide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Lost-time injuries did dip in that time period. But Amazon’s internal numbers for 2019 as a whole were significantly worse. The Fall River warehouse’s rate of lost-time injuries, for example, was more than 50% higher in 2019 compared with 2018 and six times the industry average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Just like Carney, Huseman insisted that Amazon doesn’t play games with the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“We differ from companies who take aggressive measures to avoid recording a lost time injury, such as requiring employees to come back to work immediately after injury,” he wrote. “We do not create ‘light duty’ work, even if this means that we record a lost time injury as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The internal safety reports show that Amazon did exactly that in some of its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon’s safety team last year rolled out an initiative to “drastically reduce” its rate of lost-time injuries – those considered more serious because they require days off work. But the initiative didn’t involve preventing injuries – it just prevented them from being recorded as lost time. The initiative’s name: “temporary light duty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Many injured workers, hurt to the point that they were unable to perform their warehouse jobs, were reassigned. Some were sent to tag photos on a computer to help train Amazon’s machine learning algorithms. Others were loaned to nonprofit organizations with which the company partners. The strategy, articulated in an August 2019 email from Marla Corson, Amazon’s safety director for robotic warehouses, could be used for workers whose injuries meant they had the use of only one hand or could do only sit-down work. Rolled out across the fulfillment center network, she said, it had “the potential to reduce Lost Time Injuries and workers compensation costs by 70%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon’s rate of lost-time injuries did go down in 2019. This can be better for workers because they keep their regular pay, instead of being out on workers’ comp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;But the injuries hadn’t gone away. The rate of injuries needing a job restriction or accommodation went up by just as much. Combine those categories, as OSHA often does in calculating serious injuries, and there was no improvement at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, whose district includes Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, said she’s troubled by Amazon’s lack of honesty. “I don’t know that the information I’m getting from Amazon is accurate, because mostly Amazon denies that anything is happening and says that there is a vast network of people who are simply reporting on things to make them look bad,” she said. “I just don’t believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji stk-theme_41108__style_font_style-1600758096782&quot;&gt;Amazon’s safety team knew there was a problem at its fulfillment center in Thornton, Colorado. Internal reports sent to Amazon safety managers across the country in early 2019 repeatedly flagged the warehouse for having especially high injury rates. One item in the FAQ section asked why that warehouse and six others had a rate of lost-time injuries “more than twice” the internal goal for January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The answer didn’t attribute the injury rate to unsafe working conditions. Instead, the report cited an increase in work restrictions ordered by medical providers. Workers typically get first aid at AmCare, Amazon’s on-site health centers, and may be referred to outside medical clinics – usually on contract with Amazon – if they need further medical attention. What happens at those clinics has a decisive impact on the company’s official injury records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Employers must log for OSHA any work-related injuries that require medical care beyond first aid, time off work to heal or a change to a worker’s job. These “recordable” injuries make up a company’s injury rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Keeping injuries off that log has benefits for a company. High recorded injury rates can make a company more of a target for OSHA inspectors. Keeping workers from getting medical care can also lower a company’s workers’ compensation insurance. Plus, too many injuries can lead to bad press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The report said Thornton safety staff were meeting with the facility’s most frequently used medical clinic to “discuss the impact” of the care it was giving workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;When things didn’t improve, the next month’s report, in March 2019, documented a more drastic solution: “To address the flat recordable rate, the site has … terminated the use of an occupational clinic with poor performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The warehouse, the report said, also would ensure “strong” use of the on-site AmCare first aid and “reduce the probability of associates transitioning to external clinic care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;The next month, in April 2019, Amazon contracted with a new clinic for its injured Colorado workers: Advanced Urgent Care &amp;amp; Occupational Medicine, a local operation that promoted itself online as “OSHA-Sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;According to the Advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://advurgent.com/osha-sensitive-workers-compensation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Julie Parsons, then its occupational medicine medical director, believed in “treating injuries such that they are not OSHA recordable, if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Three medical providers who worked for Advanced told me that clinic directors instructed them to avoid giving any treatment to Amazon workers that would make their injuries recordable. Normally, these providers could prescribe medications, days of rest, physical therapy or workplace restrictions, such as guidance to avoid climbing stairs or lifting anything above a certain weight. But clinic directors pressured medical staff to send injured Amazon employees back to work without any of those remedies, said the providers, who asked that their names not be used for fear of harming their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;A nurse practitioner who worked at the clinic said she dreaded seeing Amazon patients because she didn’t think she would be able to treat them appropriately. She said she remembers an Amazon worker who came to the clinic in a lot of pain from a wrist injury, crying and asking, “Can’t you do something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“I’m really sorry,” the nurse practitioner recalled telling her. “There’s really not a whole lot I can offer you right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In a July 2019 email, Parsons instructed medical staff to contact her or the clinic owner before they “think about giving restrictions or making it recordable” for Amazon patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;When they did contact the directors to recommend restrictions, the providers said they were usually told to not make them recordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“That was made very clear – that there was pressure from Amazon and it seemed like it was very explicit that you should try to avoid recordables at all costs,” said an Advanced provider who left last year. “When I felt like our policies were impacting my ability to make proper medical decisions, that made me very uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Parsons did not respond to requests for comment. Tony Euser, who owns Advanced Urgent Care, said in an interview that his clinic tries to balance the needs of employers and patients and looks for “common-sense alternatives” to treatment that would make an injury recordable. Many employers seek to limit recordable injuries and lean on workers’ compensation doctors to help them out, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“I wouldn’t put Amazon at the far end of it,” he said, “but I wouldn’t put them on the soft end of it, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Early on in the contract, he said, Amazon representatives would call his clinic out of concern about how certain cases were handled. “Now they don’t call us as much,” he said, “whether they trust us more or whether they just determined that we are trying to do the best we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Euser denied personally pressuring his providers to avoid giving Amazon workers treatment that would make their injuries recordable. He also said he had decided to stop providing occupational medical care for companies, including Amazon, at the end of this year. He said it was too much to balance the needs of employers and their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“It’s not worth it,” Euser said. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be dealing with this anymore. And we don’t want to have to play these games. And I say games, and not – they’re not games. But it’s this back-and-forth, constant thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In Amazon’s statement to Reveal, Lighty reiterated the company’s talking point that while workplace injuries are underreported in general, Amazon is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“At Amazon, we are focused on improving the safety of our workplace and seek to accurately report across all sites and all incident types, which means recording all injuries or illnesses that meet or likely meet the OSHA criteria for recordkeeping, and ensuring that we learn from these incidents and improve each day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon did not respond to questions about why it changed medical clinics for the Thornton warehouse and how medical professionals say they were pressured to keep injuries off the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__style_font_style-1600758096782 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos’ &lt;a class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;14 leadership principles&lt;/a&gt; are famous inside and outside Amazon for vividly articulating what is expected of the company’s leaders. The first is customer obsession. “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards,” it reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Tim Bray, a former Amazon executive, told me that principle is so baked into the company’s culture that it can be blinding. “It’s so absorbing, it’s hard to see outside it. It’s possible that a lot of the leaders are simply so absorbed with obsessing about customers that they just haven’t found the bandwidth to pay attention to some of the side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Bray also cited another line from the principles that might help explain Amazon: “We accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;“If you’re in one of those leadership roles, you’re used to being right,” Bray said. “Unfortunately, this can lead to an almost impossible level of arrogance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;In early May, Bray resigned as vice president of Amazon Web Services. As U.S. customers drove up sales while they sheltered in place, hundreds of Amazon warehouse workers got sick from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/#:~:text=An%20eighth%20Amazon%20warehouse%20employee%20has%20died%20from%20COVID%2D19,-Brian%20Heater%40bheater&amp;amp;text=An%20eighth%20Amazon%20employee%20has,infections%20among%20its%20warehouse%20workers.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;COVID-19 and several died&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon ultimately invested $800 million on COVID-19 safety measures in the first half of the year. But workers said the company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-one-of-amazons-hardest-hit-warehouses-why-arent-we-closing-the-building/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;slow to protect&lt;/a&gt; them and offered inadequate sick leave, leaving workers who may have been exposed to the coronavirus with the choice of going to work or not getting paid. They signed petitions calling on Amazon to shut down worksites for deep cleaning and, in a few cases, walked off the job in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Amazon responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-chris-smalls-amazon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;firing a worker&lt;/a&gt; who helped organize a walkout at its Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center. It then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;fired two employees&lt;/a&gt; from the tech side who spoke up in support. That was the last straw for Bray, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;stk-reset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;resignation post&lt;/a&gt; went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;Still, the company was – is – growing relentlessly. Its stock is up by more than 50% this year. The growth of Bezos’ personal wealth has exploded by about $60 billion so far in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;At Amazon’s annual shareholders meeting in May, Bezos was confronted with an uncomfortable question: “As Amazon gets bigger, it’s getting a lot more scrutiny. Do you think that scrutiny could hurt your reputation with customers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;stk-reset stk-theme_41108__mb_15 wp-exclude-emoji&quot;&gt;He paused, then gave his answer: “No.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How Amazon hid its safety crisis
&lt;p&gt;Will Evans | September 29, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots. Prime Day. Holiday peak. Internal records show Amazon has deceived the public on rising injury rates among its warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;
Anthony Zinonos for Reveal
&lt;p&gt;On Cyber Monday 2014, Amazon operations chief Dave Clark proudly unveiled the company’s new warehouse of the future in Tracy, California.  Behind him, tall yellow racks packed with vitamins, toy rockets and paintball gear zipped across the floor, lugged by the powerful, squat orange robots that would help catapult the company toward world domination. In a checked shirt and with neatly parted hair, Clark looked more the part of a high school teacher than a corporate executive, as he cheerfully called himself “head elf of Santa’s workshop around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Amazon’s transformation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3917309278001/#sp=show-clips&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s better for everybody.” Workers no longer would have to walk massive warehouse floors to find the right power drill – instead, robots would bring the drill directly to them. The hour or more it took to process a package had been shaved down to as little as 15 minutes. More Amazon customers could now get products delivered to their door the same day they clicked “Buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following July, Amazon rolled out another innovation: Prime Day. The holiday-shopping season was already an intense pressure cooker of warehouse activity known as “peak” inside Amazon. Now the company had just manufactured a second peak in the middle of the year: a brand-new holiday that would become pivotal to the company’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in the six years since Clark stood in that cavernous warehouse and saw the future, the company’s value has leaped from less than $150 billion to more than $1 trillion, and CEO Jeff Bezos has become the richest person in the world. The company’s top leaders have fashioned a mythology around its growth, casting Amazon as a force for good. Its obsession with delighting customers fuels a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/about-amazon&quot;&gt;virtuous cycle&lt;/a&gt;,” they say, that ends up benefiting everyone – even Amazon’s more than 250,000 warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, as senators have fired off letters to the company and workers have led walkouts over health and safety, Amazon has engaged in an unapologetic public relations campaign. Robots, Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-innovation/what-robots-do-and-dont-do-at-amazon-fulfillment-centers&quot;&gt;insists&lt;/a&gt;, are good for workers. “They make the job safer,” Jeff Wilke, one of two CEOs under Bezos, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/jeff-wilke/&quot;&gt;PBS FRONTLINE&lt;/a&gt; last September. And Prime Day and the holiday rush are so well orchestrated, Amazon has claimed, that injury rates stay flat or even go down during these buying frenzies. Thanks to “diligent record-keeping,” Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-describe-peak-2019-2&quot;&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, “we know for a fact that recordable incidents do not increase during peak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new cache of company records obtained by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting – including internal safety reports and weekly injury numbers from its nationwide network of fulfillment centers – shows that company officials have profoundly misled the public and lawmakers about its record on worker safety. They reveal a mounting injury crisis at Amazon warehouses, one that is especially acute at robotic facilities and during Prime week and the holiday peak – and one that Amazon has gone to great lengths to conceal. With weekly data from 2016 through 2019 from more than 150 Amazon warehouses, the records definitively expose the brutal cost to workers of Amazon’s vast shipping empire – and the bald misrepresentations the company has deployed to hide its growing safety crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal reports cheer incremental progress in a specific month or region; call out problem warehouses with the worst injury numbers; and detail safety initiatives, action items and pilot projects. While the reports show a committed drive to improve processes with technology or design changes, they don’t propose reducing the intense workload for Amazon’s warehouse employees, which is what helps drive Amazon’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/safety&quot;&gt;often points&lt;/a&gt; to the tens of millions of dollars it has invested to enhance safety practices. Yet Amazon’s injury rates have gone up each of the past four years, the internal data shows. In 2019, Amazon fulfillment centers recorded 14,000 serious injuries – those requiring days off or job restrictions. The overall rate of 7.7 serious injuries per 100 employees was 33% higher than in 2016 and nearly double the most recent industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data back up the accounts of Amazon warehouse workers and former safety professionals who say the company has used the robots to ratchet up production quotas to the point that humans can’t keep up without hurting themselves. For each of the past four years, injury rates have been significantly higher at Amazon’s robotic warehouses than at its traditional sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for years, the internal data show, injury rates have spiked during the weeks of Prime Day and Cyber Monday, contrary to Amazon’s public claims. Those two weeks had the highest rate of serious injuries for all of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly bulletins from Amazon’s environment, health and safety team show that the famously data-obsessed company is well aware of its safety problems. Each month, company officials sent out detailed updates – marked “Privileged &amp;amp; Confidential” – to warehouse safety managers across the country with data, charts and FAQs. They set safety goals and monitor progress closely. But the internal documents show that the company has failed to hit these targets. In 2018, Amazon aimed to lower its injury rate by 20%. Instead, injury rates went up. The next year, the goal was more modest: a 5% decrease. But the rate rose again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Bezos told shareholders that he welcomed scrutiny of the company’s operations. “It’s good for us,” he said. “Nothing is more important,” he added, “than the health and well-being of our employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon declined Reveal’s interview request and did not respond to detailed questions about the accuracy of its public statements. Instead, a company spokesperson provided a general statement about its warehouse safety initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our teams. So far in 2020, we have committed over $1B in new investments in operations safety measures, ranging from technology investments in safety to masks, gloves, and the enhanced cleaning and sanitization required to protect employees from the spread of Covid-19,” spokesperson Rachael Lighty said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the company has seen improvements through an array of programs inside its warehouses, such as installing guardrails to separate forklifts from pedestrians, increasing safety staffing and offering wellness exercises. “Our investments in safety training and education programs, in technology and new safety infrastructure are working,” Lighty said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet her email didn’t say how the company justifies its claim that these initiatives are working, while injury rates have continued, year after year, to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;excerpt-copy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon says its warehouses are safe for workers. But the numbers reveal that workers are getting hurt much more often than the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;About an hour south on Interstate 5 from Amazon’s Seattle headquarters is DuPont, Washington, and a company warehouse called BFI3. Last year, its workers experienced the highest injury rates of any Amazon fulfillment center in the country: 22 serious injuries for every 100 workers. That’s a rate more than five times higher than the most recent industry average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cecilia Hoyos has been at the company for nine years. She lives just a block away from BFI3, and her $17.90 hourly wage supports two children and a 1½-year-old granddaughter. Earlier this month, she spent her 56th birthday at work in the warehouse. She often talks about how much she loves her job – she likes being around people and keeping busy. “It’s just that it’s hurting me and they’re not listening to what my body’s telling me,” Hoyos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the warehouse opened in 2014, Hoyos has seen the production quotas go higher and higher. Managers would closely monitor a computer system that tracks how many items an employee scans every hour and write up workers who weren’t hitting targets. Workers who fell too far behind could be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those quotas changed dramatically when the robots arrived at Amazon. Company officials promised they’d save workers such as Hoyos from the fatigue of walking miles a day to find customer orders. All they would have to do is stand in place and grab things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was so cool,” she said. But she soon wished she were back to walking all day. Instead of greeting colleagues as she moved through the facility, she was isolated at a workstation, and standing 10 hours a day doing repetitive motions proved to be much harder on her body, Hoyos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robots were too efficient. They could bring items so quickly that the productivity expectations for workers more than doubled, according to a former senior operations manager who saw the transformation. And they kept climbing. At the most common kind of warehouse, workers called pickers – who previously had to grab and scan about 100 items an hour – were expected to hit rates of up to 400 an hour at robotic fulfillment centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kathleen Fagan, a physician who inspected Amazon warehouses in her capacity as a medical officer for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, studies have shown that production rates have a direct impact on injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve got robots that are moving product faster and workers have to then lift or move those products faster, there’ll be increased injuries,” she said. Doing the same motion over and over again, quickly and without a break, doesn’t allow muscles to rest. Increased physical and mental stress leads to distraction and exhaustion, which also increase injuries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24669547/&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24669552/&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former senior Amazon safety manager said that within a year or two of introducing the robots, the unintended consequences had become clear to Amazon’s safety team. “We vastly underestimated the effects it was going to have on our associates,” said the former safety manager, whom we agreed not to name because he left on good terms with the company and, overall, has a positive impression of how Amazon otherwise handled safety. “We realized early on there was an issue. It was just – you’re already moving that way at light speed, so how do you take a step back and readjust?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as December 2015, just over a year after Amazon debuted its fleet of robots, OSHA issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Amazon_1074833_eHAL.pdf&quot;&gt;hazard alert letter&lt;/a&gt; against an Amazon robotic warehouse in New Jersey. OSHA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region3/01122016&quot;&gt;called out&lt;/a&gt; Amazon for conditions that resulted from the robotics innovation: “The company exposed employees to ergonomic risk factors including stress from repeated bending at the waist and repeated exertions, and standing during entire shifts up to 10 hours, four days a week and sometimes including mandatory overtime shifts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal agency recommended measures – such as an extra rest break and rotating employees to different jobs throughout the day – that Amazon has yet to implement across its warehouse network. And Amazon’s data show that by the end of 2016, its robotic warehouses had significantly higher injury rates than its traditional facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in May 2019, Wilke, Amazon’s co-CEO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffawilke/status/1132035105906577408&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet, “What some folks may not know is that the robots make those jobs better and safer.” He also said robots allow “people to take advantage of their innate human creativity instead of doing rote things over and over again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s robotic fulfillment centers have higher serious injury rates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Serious injuries are work-related injuries and illnesses that require days away from work or a job restriction. Sortable warehouses, which ship small- and medium-sized items, are the most common type of Amazon fulfillment center. The data for 2019 includes 46 robotic and 13 nonrobotic sortable warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s data – available at the time in widely circulated internal reports – shows otherwise. At the most common type of Amazon fulfillment center, those that ship small- and medium-sized items, the rate of serious injuries from 2016 to 2019 was more than 50% higher at warehouses with robots than ones without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon did not respond to the finding that its robotic facilities have higher injury rates, instead reiterating its claim that “the use of robotics, automation and technology in our fulfillment centers is enhancing our workplace, making jobs safer and more efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Day is one of Amazon’s two most crucial sales periods. Amazon Prime members get access to more than a million deals over what is now two days; workers get mandatory overtime, with shifts extended from 10 to 12 hours or extra shifts added to an already grueling job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Day 2019 was the biggest shopping event in the company’s history. It was also the year’s most dangerous week for injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers, with nearly 400 serious injuries recorded across the country. Reveal calculated those numbers from Amazon’s internal data. Yet Amazon officials have publicly denied that rates spike during these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/&quot;&gt;Reveal investigation&lt;/a&gt; showed that the company’s obsession with speed had turned its warehouses into injury mills. When asked about injuries during Prime Day and the holidays for that story, an Amazon spokesperson told Reveal that “the rate of injury – an average rate of injury per person – has historically decreased or been stable during these two times.” In a safety report from that same month, a line graph illustrates Amazon’s injury rates for 2019. The tallest spike is right in the middle of the year, during the week of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just five months earlier, in June 2019, the monthly report from the Amazon safety director in charge of robotic warehouses across the country was frank about the risks. Warehouses in the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Connecticut were “expecting an increase in injuries across all sites during Prime Week.” Injuries already had increased in the ramp-up to Prime Day, a trend the report attributed to mandatory overtime and bringing in 1,200 to 2,000 seasonal employees to each robotic site in that region. Both the overtime and the influx of new workers were labeled “high-risk situations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injuries spike the weeks of Prime Day, Cyber Monday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Amazon had several safety initiatives in the works. A pilot project to do what OSHA had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Amazon_1074833_eHAL.pdf&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; years before – rotate workers to different jobs to alleviate repetitive stress – had shown promise in reducing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sales came first. “Despite the considerable benefits, half of the pilot sites decided to turn off sort rotation during Prime Week,” Amazon’s safety team reported in August 2019. A November report said that while the job rotation had driven down injury rates in robotic warehouses, “adherence is declining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pilot project, outlined in a May 2019 report, sought to lower injuries by blocking off the highest and lowest shelves on warehouse racks, “optimizing work allocation to an associate’s power zone,” so workers wouldn’t have to bend as low or reach as high. According to the report, ergonomic issues such as excessive repetition and bending down led to 74% of injuries among the workers who stowed away and picked out customer orders in robotic warehouses in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pilot project, however, was designed for use only “during non-Peak.” And out of six warehouses testing the pilot, five put it on hold for the runup to Prime Day. The report warned there was “risk of complete termination of (the) project.” Amazon declined to provide an update on the program’s current status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has maintained that the company properly staffs its warehouses with safety officials. An Amazon spokesperson told me last November, “We ensure we have adequate leadership and safety staff on hand during these peak times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet an August 2019 report described safety staffing at robotic warehouses as being “critically low.” That October, another report again warned of staffing problems at robotic warehouses, including safety-team attrition in the region that covers New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Connecticut that “will put several sites understaffed going into Peak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As last year’s holiday-shopping season approached, Amazon’s safety managers received talking points to pass along to workers fatigued from 12-hour shifts and 60-hour weeks. “Mandatory Extra Time,” it said, “requires us to give a little extra to stay customer obsessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take the time away from work to recharge your internal battery,” the list of tips suggests. “Smile and laugh with the people in your life that bring you joy. Sleep in on your day off. Binge your favorite shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Wendt left his job as an EMT for a private ambulance company in 2016 to take a higher-paying role running the first aid clinic at Amazon’s warehouse BFI3 in DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he became the only person responsible for safety at the warehouse during his shifts. A safety specialist had quit and wasn’t replaced. His manager, he said, was rarely on-site. Overworked and overwhelmed, Wendt was being asked to do things he wasn’t trained to do, he said, such as ergonomic assessments of workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never had support from my boss or senior leadership, to do my job effectively or enforce safety,” he said. “There’s so much to do and you’re so far behind, and there’s so many injuries that you could just never get caught up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d watch workers heave heavy bags of dog food and cat litter all night – tens of thousands of pounds in some cases, he estimated. And the workers had to do it quick. Under constant pressure to hit ever-increasing production rates, they took shortcuts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of climbing a ladder to grab a heavy item off a top shelf, workers would get on their tiptoes and reach. Or they’d bend over, instead of squatting, to grab a bag, then twist to put it down quickly. They’d grab a heavy tote off a conveyor belt with one hand while pressing a button on a computer screen with the other. The extra hours, fatigue and stress of peak times compounded the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
An associate hands merchandise to a fellow worker at the Amazon fulfillment center in DuPont, Wash., in February 2015. In 2018, 36% of the site’s workers gave an “unfavorable” response to the staff survey question: “Does the safety training match the real world expectations of your job?” (Stephen Brashear/Getty Images)
&lt;p&gt;“I’d have managers sitting there watching these people work very improperly” he said, “and they don’t say anything. Because it’s about rate and productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Amazon safety officials did what they called a “deep dive” analysis into why so many workers at the DuPont warehouse gave negative feedback in a routine safety survey. To the question, “Does the safety training match the real world expectations of your job?” 36% of the site’s workers gave an “unfavorable” response. For months, that was the safety question with the worst response, and it wasn’t budging even with retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out why, Amazon got a common explanation from workers, according to the report: The work “requires me to move too quickly, so I am forced to either cut corners or not make rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said BFI3 leadership was seeking “to improve processes and ensure that they can be performed safely at rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet not one of the dozens of safety initiatives described in the 2018 and 2019 internal safety reports obtained by Reveal suggests slowing down production quotas to reduce injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the end, I don’t think it’s that hard of an issue,” Wendt said; the answer is to “lower the rate.” But, he added, “I don’t think that was ever an option in their head or even thought of as a route to take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendt left Amazon for a fire department job in early 2019. That year, the warehouse’s injury problem got even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cecilia Hoyos accounted for two of the injuries on the warehouse logs that year. For one, in July 2019, the heavy lifting and repetition caught up with her. After an entire shift spent unloading a trailer – grabbing heavy boxes and putting them on a conveyor belt – she had a hard time walking to her front door. Trying not to complain, she returned to unloading trailers the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was killing me, but OK, that’s my job,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a break, Hoyos found she couldn’t walk back to her workstation. She ended up with a hip injury that put her off work for months, according to Amazon’s injury logs. That and other work injuries have left her in constant pain, she said, leaving her feeling like her 80-year-old mother when she climbs stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoyos said Amazon should have workers rotate jobs to lessen the repetitive strain. But managers don’t listen, she said. “They say no because they only think about the rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warehouse leaders would, however, offer pizza parties as a reward for a streak of injury-free shifts, Wendt said – so some workers would push through the pain rather than be the person who cost their co-workers free pizza. Managers were effectively “offering rewards for not reporting injuries,” Wendt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, a group of 15 U.S. senators, led by Sherrod Brown, Bernie Sanders and Tammy Baldwin, demanded that Bezos make a long list of changes in Amazon’s warehouses after Reveal’s initial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These reports make clear that by placing such a priority on speed and quota fulfillment, your company requires employees to risk their safety and health to perform and keep their jobs,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-sanders-baldwin-demand-answers-from-amazon-as-work-related-injuries-continue-to-rise-&quot;&gt;the letter reads&lt;/a&gt;. The senators also demanded a response from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, pushed back on the idea that the company had a worker injury problem, telling the senators that other companies underreport their injuries. “In 2016, we decided to change our approach to recordkeeping and design a system that reported all injuries – no matter the severity,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6786669-Amazon-Safety-Response-02-21-2020.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in response to the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the 2015 OSHA investigation of the fulfillment center in New Jersey found that Amazon had failed to record more than two dozen injuries as required, leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region3/01122016&quot;&gt;$7,000 fine&lt;/a&gt;. And several former Amazon safety professionals told me that the company used to systematically hide injuries by having safety staff write up “justifications” for not recording injuries that should have been counted by federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days after the senators sent their letter, Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xoj7y2MwEo&quot;&gt;went on&lt;/a&gt; CNBC to talk about the company having raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour. When asked about the letter, he echoed the argument that the company’s injury rates are so high today only because it initiated a policy of zealous compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Across the country, injuries are woefully underreported,” he said. “That was true at Amazon a number of years ago, and then we changed the way we report injuries. That spiked the numbers for us. We report well above what’s required by OSHA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fagan helped lead that 2015 inspection as a medical officer for OSHA. She found Amazon’s on-site clinics would send injured workers back to work instead of referring them to another clinic for proper medical attention. “What we learned was really surprising, actually shocking,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fagan went on to investigate Amazon warehouses in New Jersey again and found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/12/02/amazon-warehouse-workers-safety-cyber-monday/&quot;&gt;same problems&lt;/a&gt; with medical care. Workers were still being discouraged from reporting injuries in 2017 and from seeking outside medical attention in 2019, Fagan found. In another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6584275-Amazon-Robbinsville-OSHA-Letter-081919.html&quot;&gt;hazard alert letter&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA criticized Amazon for explicitly allowing AmCare, Amazon’s system of on-site medical clinics, to delay sending workers to a doctor for up to 21 days. The result was that workers’ injuries got worse while they waited for proper medical care, she said. “The company did not improve,” Fagan, who has since retired, told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, that’s shameful,” she said. “This is a company that makes enormous profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon also has selectively released flattering numbers to inquiring Congress members, even when the big picture is far grimmer. Last November, after Reveal reported that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/find-out-what-injuries-are-like-at-the-amazon-warehouse-that-handled-your-packages/&quot;&gt;2018 injury rates&lt;/a&gt; at a warehouse in Fall River, Massachusetts, were nearly triple the industry average, Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6590447-2019-12-20-Letter-to-Mr-Bezos-on-Fall-River.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to Bezos “seeking answers about why so many Massachusetts workers are getting seriously injured at Amazon fulfillment centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huseman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7215123-Amazon-Response-to-Warren-Markey-Kennedy-Letter.html&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;, “The injury data by itself does not tell the full story.” He declined to provide the 2019 annual injury numbers the lawmakers had requested, but cited one data point: The 2019 holiday peak produced a lower rate of injuries requiring time off work compared with 2018, a change he attributed to “the continuous improvement initiatives executed locally and companywide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious injury rates at Amazon’s Fall River warehouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Serious injuries are work-related injuries and illnesses that require days away from work or a job restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost-time injuries did dip in that time period. But Amazon’s internal numbers for 2019 as a whole were significantly worse. The Fall River warehouse’s rate of lost-time injuries, for example, was more than 50% higher in 2019 compared with 2018 and six times the industry average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Carney, Huseman insisted that Amazon doesn’t play games with the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We differ from companies who take aggressive measures to avoid recording a lost time injury, such as requiring employees to come back to work immediately after injury,” he wrote. “We do not create ‘light duty’ work, even if this means that we record a lost time injury as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal safety reports show that Amazon did exactly that in some of its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s safety team last year rolled out an initiative to “drastically reduce” its rate of lost-time injuries – those considered more serious because they require days off work. But the initiative didn’t involve preventing injuries – it just prevented them from being recorded as lost time. The initiative’s name: “temporary light duty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many injured workers, hurt to the point that they were unable to perform their warehouse jobs, were reassigned. Some were sent to tag photos on a computer to help train Amazon’s machine learning algorithms. Others were loaned to nonprofit organizations with which the company partners. The strategy, articulated in an August 2019 email from Marla Corson, Amazon’s safety director for robotic warehouses, could be used for workers whose injuries meant they had the use of only one hand or could do only sit-down work. Rolled out across the fulfillment center network, she said, it had “the potential to reduce Lost Time Injuries and workers compensation costs by 70%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s rate of lost-time injuries did go down in 2019. This can be better for workers because they keep their regular pay, instead of being out on workers’ comp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the injuries hadn’t gone away. The rate of injuries needing a job restriction or accommodation went up by just as much. Combine those categories, as OSHA often does in calculating serious injuries, and there was no improvement at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, whose district includes Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, said she’s troubled by Amazon’s lack of honesty. “I don’t know that the information I’m getting from Amazon is accurate, because mostly Amazon denies that anything is happening and says that there is a vast network of people who are simply reporting on things to make them look bad,” she said. “I just don’t believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;
Anthony Zinonos for Reveal
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s safety team knew there was a problem at its fulfillment center in Thornton, Colorado. Internal reports sent to Amazon safety managers across the country in early 2019 repeatedly flagged the warehouse for having especially high injury rates. One item in the FAQ section asked why that warehouse and six others had a rate of lost-time injuries “more than twice” the internal goal for January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer didn’t attribute the injury rate to unsafe working conditions. Instead, the report cited an increase in work restrictions ordered by medical providers. Workers typically get first aid at AmCare, Amazon’s on-site health centers, and may be referred to outside medical clinics – usually on contract with Amazon – if they need further medical attention. What happens at those clinics has a decisive impact on the company’s official injury records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers must log for OSHA any work-related injuries that require medical care beyond first aid, time off work to heal or a change to a worker’s job. These “recordable” injuries make up a company’s injury rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping injuries off that log has benefits for a company. High recorded injury rates can make a company more of a target for OSHA inspectors. Keeping workers from getting medical care can also lower a company’s workers’ compensation insurance. Plus, too many injuries can lead to bad press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said Thornton safety staff were meeting with the facility’s most frequently used medical clinic to “discuss the impact” of the care it was giving workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things didn’t improve, the next month’s report, in March 2019, documented a more drastic solution: “To address the flat recordable rate, the site has … terminated the use of an occupational clinic with poor performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warehouse, the report said, also would ensure “strong” use of the on-site AmCare first aid and “reduce the probability of associates transitioning to external clinic care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next month, in April 2019, Amazon contracted with a new clinic for its injured Colorado workers: Advanced Urgent Care &amp;amp; Occupational Medicine, a local operation that promoted itself online as “OSHA-Sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://advurgent.com/osha-sensitive-workers-compensation/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Julie Parsons, then its occupational medicine medical director, believed in “treating injuries such that they are not OSHA recordable, if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious injuries at Amazon’s Thornton warehouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded injuries began to decline after Amazon contracted with an “OSHA-Sensitive” clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three medical providers who worked for Advanced told me that clinic directors instructed them to avoid giving any treatment to Amazon workers that would make their injuries recordable. Normally, these providers could prescribe medications, days of rest, physical therapy or workplace restrictions, such as guidance to avoid climbing stairs or lifting anything above a certain weight. But clinic directors pressured medical staff to send injured Amazon employees back to work without any of those remedies, said the providers, who asked that their names not be used for fear of harming their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nurse practitioner who worked at the clinic said she dreaded seeing Amazon patients because she didn’t think she would be able to treat them appropriately. She said she remembers an Amazon worker who came to the clinic in a lot of pain from a wrist injury, crying and asking, “Can’t you do something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really sorry,” the nurse practitioner recalled telling her. “There’s really not a whole lot I can offer you right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 2019 email, Parsons instructed medical staff to contact her or the clinic owner before they “think about giving restrictions or making it recordable” for Amazon patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they did contact the directors to recommend restrictions, the providers said they were usually told to not make them recordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was made very clear – that there was pressure from Amazon and it seemed like it was very explicit that you should try to avoid recordables at all costs,” said an Advanced provider who left last year. “When I felt like our policies were impacting my ability to make proper medical decisions, that made me very uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsons did not respond to requests for comment. Tony Euser, who owns Advanced Urgent Care, said in an interview that his clinic tries to balance the needs of employers and patients and looks for “common-sense alternatives” to treatment that would make an injury recordable. Many employers seek to limit recordable injuries and lean on workers’ compensation doctors to help them out, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t put Amazon at the far end of it,” he said, “but I wouldn’t put them on the soft end of it, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in the contract, he said, Amazon representatives would call his clinic out of concern about how certain cases were handled. “Now they don’t call us as much,” he said, “whether they trust us more or whether they just determined that we are trying to do the best we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euser denied personally pressuring his providers to avoid giving Amazon workers treatment that would make their injuries recordable. He also said he had decided to stop providing occupational medical care for companies, including Amazon, at the end of this year. He said it was too much to balance the needs of employers and their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not worth it,” Euser said. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be dealing with this anymore. And we don’t want to have to play these games. And I say games, and not – they’re not games. But it’s this back-and-forth, constant thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Amazon’s statement to Reveal, Lighty reiterated the company’s talking point that while workplace injuries are underreported in general, Amazon is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Amazon, we are focused on improving the safety of our workplace and seek to accurately report across all sites and all incident types, which means recording all injuries or illnesses that meet or likely meet the OSHA criteria for recordkeeping, and ensuring that we learn from these incidents and improve each day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon did not respond to questions about why it changed medical clinics for the Thornton warehouse and how medical professionals say they were pressured to keep injuries off the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles&quot;&gt;14 leadership principles&lt;/a&gt; are famous inside and outside Amazon for vividly articulating what is expected of the company’s leaders. The first is customer obsession. “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards,” it reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Bray, a former Amazon executive, told me that principle is so baked into the company’s culture that it can be blinding. “It’s so absorbing, it’s hard to see outside it. It’s possible that a lot of the leaders are simply so absorbed with obsessing about customers that they just haven’t found the bandwidth to pay attention to some of the side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bray also cited another line from the principles that might help explain Amazon: “We accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in one of those leadership roles, you’re used to being right,” Bray said. “Unfortunately, this can lead to an almost impossible level of arrogance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early May, Bray resigned as vice president of Amazon Web Services. As U.S. customers drove up sales while they sheltered in place, hundreds of Amazon warehouse workers got sick from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/#:~:text=An%20eighth%20Amazon%20warehouse%20employee%20has%20died%20from%20COVID%2D19,-Brian%20Heater%40bheater&amp;amp;text=An%20eighth%20Amazon%20employee%20has,infections%20among%20its%20warehouse%20workers.&quot;&gt;COVID-19 and several died&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon ultimately invested $800 million on COVID-19 safety measures in the first half of the year. But workers said the company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-one-of-amazons-hardest-hit-warehouses-why-arent-we-closing-the-building/&quot;&gt;slow to protect&lt;/a&gt; them and offered inadequate sick leave, leaving workers who may have been exposed to the coronavirus with the choice of going to work or not getting paid. They signed petitions calling on Amazon to shut down worksites for deep cleaning and, in a few cases, walked off the job in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-chris-smalls-amazon.html&quot;&gt;firing a worker&lt;/a&gt; who helped organize a walkout at its Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center. It then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/&quot;&gt;fired two employees&lt;/a&gt; from the tech side who spoke up in support. That was the last straw for Bray, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon&quot;&gt;resignation post&lt;/a&gt; went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the company was – is – growing relentlessly. Its stock is up by more than 50% this year. The growth of Bezos’ personal wealth has exploded by about $60 billion so far in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Amazon’s annual shareholders meeting in May, Bezos was confronted with an uncomfortable question: “As Amazon gets bigger, it’s getting a lot more scrutiny. Do you think that scrutiny could hurt your reputation with customers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, then gave his answer: “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 2021: GUI</title>
<link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/28/rust-2021.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/28/rust-2021.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a response to the Rust &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/03/Planning-2021-Roadmap.html&quot;&gt;call for blogs 2021&lt;/a&gt; and also a followup to &lt;a href=&quot;https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2019/10/31/rust-2020.html&quot;&gt;last year’s entry&lt;/a&gt;. It will be entirely focused on GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable interest in GUI toolkits for Rust. As one data point, it was the 6th highest rated challenge for adoption in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html#rust-adoption---a-closer-look&quot;&gt;2019 Rust survey&lt;/a&gt;, just behind async I/O. There is also a fair amount of activity towards this goal, though as a community it still feels a bit unfocused. A characteristic sign is that a new GUI toolkit seems to pop up every couple of months or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there is great potential for a high-quality GUI toolkit in Rust. At the same time, it’s an incredibly ambitious task. Subtasks within it, for example accelerated GPU drawing and text layout, are in and of themselves incredibly ambitious tasks. I wouldn’t consider a toolkit “ready” for production use until it supported accessibility, and as far as I know there is nothing in the Rust space even starting to work on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, perhaps against my better judgment, I find myself devoting most of my time and energy towards building GUI in Rust. In this post I will set out my hopes but also frankly discuss the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-gui-in-rust&quot;&gt;Why GUI in Rust?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, I believe that the strengths of Rust translate well to writing GUI applications, and that the missing piece is the existence of a good toolkit. One strength is Rust’s wide “dynamic range” – the ability to describe application logic in high level terms while still being attentive to low level details. Another is &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; cross-platform compatibility. The increasingly rich crate ecosystem is compelling in many domains. And don’t lose sight of the importance of safety. In traditional object-oriented GUI in C++ especially, object lifetimes can be complicated, and it’s not hard to cause crashes, especially on takeoffs and landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do pay attention to the competitive space, and one thing I see is Electron being used more and more, because it solves real problems. But I also believe that the success of Electron creates a real opportunity for a higher performance, lighter weight alternative. And in general for the projects I see in other languages, I find myself &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to compete against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-druid&quot;&gt;About Druid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/druid&quot;&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; toolkit has made impressive progress in the last year, but is still nowhere near stable or complete. If you are looking for a GUI toolkit to develop your application today, Druid is not it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing the font editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/runebender&quot;&gt;Runebender&lt;/a&gt; as the primary motivating application, but, while a lot of pieces are in place, it is sadly not yet usable for day to day font creation work. One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start creating a font in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I am very proud of the work that’s been done in the last year. To hit on some of the highlights, we’re just landing basic but capable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmyr.net/blog/piet-text-work.html&quot;&gt;rich text layout&lt;/a&gt;. The keyboard event is close to browser quality (based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/keyboard-types&quot;&gt;keyboard-types&lt;/a&gt;). There is incremental painting based on damage regions. Multi-window support is solid, with support for controlling window placement and dynamic hi-dpi. There is tab-focusing between text boxes. All of these are hard problems. Even more so, I am pleased that a lot of the work came from people in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;converging-a-vision&quot;&gt;Converging a vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a thought experiment for a bit. Obviously Rust is promising for implementing async, but there isn’t a consensus on the best way to do it. Some people feel it should be done with callbacks, and invest considerable effort into overcoming the serious problems with that approach. Others feel it should be done with a polling future trait, but there are multiple versions of that trait: some get the context from thread local storage, others pass it into the poll method. And of course some people feel the syntax should be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;future.await&lt;/code&gt; while others insist on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;await!(future)&lt;/code&gt;. Every couple of months somebody pops up on /r/rust with a new crate that promises to solve “the async problem,” complete with a nice-looking echo server demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about where we are today with GUI toolkits. In many ways, I think converging on a single vision in GUI is a harder problem than for async. For one, people have different things they want to do. I’m personally most interested in things that resemble document editors. Others want 3D or video content. In the future, there might be commercial interest in enterprise line-of-business apps or interfaces for medical devices. These all have quite different requirements in the best ways to express UI logic, and how to build them. Not to mention the endless opportunities to bikeshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not (yet) proposing Druid as the singular vision that the Rust community should converge on. I’m enjoying reading codebases and learning from other Rust GUI projects. In particular, I’m finding lots to like about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hecrj/iced&quot;&gt;Iced&lt;/a&gt;: it has good solutions to async, 3D graphics (through wgpu), being able to function in a guest window (important for VST plug-ins), among other problems. And I’m getting the sense that it’s easier for developers. The Elm-like reactive architecture maps nicely to Rust, and depending on exactly what you’re trying to do, it’s not hard to figure out how to express your app-specific logic. By contrast, Druid’s reactive model, while efficient and powerful in many ways, has complex concepts such as Haskell-like lenses, and places a burden on the developer to carefully design the “app data” to fit the Druid model. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/25/principled-reactive-ui.html&quot;&gt;Crochet research prototype&lt;/a&gt; is an active exploration into making that simpler. I am thankful to Iced (and other toolkits) for being a model to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work to build consensus is complex and multifaceted, and it cannot be rushed. From my side, I hope to improve the designs and implementations to the point where they are compelling. I also hope to listen to criticisms, many of which are valid. I also think there is more work the community can be doing here. I’d love to see more active effort in trying to learn from the ongoing work and try to synthesize it. The GUI-related threads on /r/rust are sadly not a place where that happens; they most often consist of a statement of requirements (usually presented very informally), followed by a bit of bikeshedding. I don’t have a good answer for how to improve this situation, but put it out there as a problem I’m feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think a converged vision is an admirable and ambitious goal, it may not be necessary for a successful GUI ecosystem in Rust. It’s possible that different types of GUI programs will simply require different infrastructure, so even in the long term it makes sense to have ecosystem diversity. Certainly that’s the case in the short and medium term as well, just to explore the space. And even without a grand unifying vision, there is lots of scope to work on infrastructural crates for important pieces of the GUI story, including text layout and related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-and-community&quot;&gt;Learning and community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Rust projects these days come with what’s basically a marketing pitch: “adopt this codebase, it’s awesome.” I am starting to see the Druid project in a somewhat different light. I consider its primary mission to be &lt;em&gt;teaching and learning&lt;/em&gt; the knowledge required to build GUI. To that extent, the community we’re building, hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://xi.zulipchat.com/&quot;&gt;our Zulip instance,&lt;/a&gt; is just as important as the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge needed to build GUI has many aspects, and is at all levels. Some of it is at a high level, like the best way to express reactive UI. Some of it is at a low level, like the keyboard event processing. A common thread is that a lot of is is very arcane, not really written down properly anywhere. Fortunately, a lot of it is accessible through reading the code of other open source projects, whether in Rust or in other languages (I’ve found both Chromium and Gecko to be especially useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I consider this a goal, a success criterion, of the Druid project. If somebody wants to know how to solve a problem in GUI, the Druid codebase should be one of the best places to look for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love research more than most anything, and a lot of my own work has a strong research flavor. That has caused some confusion; some of the things I’m exploring are very speculative and will likely take years to come to fruition. Certainly my research into compute-centric GPU rendering is of that nature; I’m excited about the fact that it promises dramatic performance improvements over the current state of the art, but it’s nowhere near ready to put into production yet. I’m striving for clearer communication so people can have a better idea what is speculative, based on grand futuristic visions, and what is on track to being usable reasonably soon. But both are important aspects of what I consider to be the main mission: fostering learning about how to build GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;baby-steps&quot;&gt;Baby steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am driven by a long-term, ambitious vision, the goal of Druid in 2021 is not to deliver a general UI toolkit. Rather, we are deliberately continuing to follow a narrow scope. The primary goal remains the font editor project, and we plan to re-focus attention on that. I do think this is an attainable goal. I also think that what we learn from trying to build a real application with users will be extremely valuable to the more ambitious task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One project management technique that is proving effective is “cycles.” Instead of trying to solve the most ambitious version of a problem, we choose up front what to push to a future cycle, reducing the scope for the current implementation cycle. An example is the choice to defer BiDi from our recent text work. This is obviously an essential feature for a real GUI toolkit, but we also know it could take weeks or months to get it right. To have any chance of shipping, we have to carefully budget our time and energy on subprojects that easily could expand to absorb our full attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common development pattern for a fledgling GUI toolkit is to have a “hero app” that drives development. It really helps clarify requirements, and also makes it easier to change things without having to worry as much about churn in the ecosystem. For Druid, that is the Runebender font editor. We want to increase our focus on that in coming months, and that is also reflected in our approach to community: we will happily mentor Druid features that fit on the Runebender roadmap. Other features that don’t massively stretch the scope can happen, but will really need to be driven by the people in the community. And we will push back against things that are off roadmap and require a huge amount of work, simply because our bandwidth for mentoring and review is finite. Even so, I remain impressed by the scope and quality of contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-wishlist&quot;&gt;A wishlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I’d especially like from the rest of the Rust community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’d love for wgpu to become more mature, as I think it is the most promising approach to GPU for the future. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/druid/issues/891&quot;&gt;roadmap for 3D&lt;/a&gt; basically depends on it. Much love to that community for the progress they’ve made so far and hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, while we generally find Windows platform bindings to be straightforward, thanks to the excellent winapi bindings (and hopefully a stable &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/com-rs&quot;&gt;com-rs&lt;/a&gt; shortly), the situation on macOS is not as good. There are real problems interoperating with Objective-C code, including type-safety in wrappers that also allow subclassing, and continual friction around autorelease pools. There are also different, incompatible conventions around wrapping foreign types (foreign_object vs TCFType). None of this is blocking, but it makes developing macOS platform integration less fun. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24309565&quot;&gt;this HN thread&lt;/a&gt; for a bit more background)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, some perhaps surprisingly good news. I prefer Rust crates when possible rather than relying on C++, but for OpenType font shaping, we would have to call into HarfBuzz. Now not one but two Rust solutions are on the horizon: &lt;a href=&quot;https://yeslogic.com/blog/allsorts-rust-font-shaping-engine.html&quot;&gt;Allsorts&lt;/a&gt; from YesLogic, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RazrFalcon/rustybuzz&quot;&gt;rustybuzz&lt;/a&gt; from RazrFalcon. Both are young, but I can see adopting them (primarily for use on Linux, which is still work in progress; on Windows and macOS we use the platform text layout capabilities). I know of no other language besides C++ that has working OpenType font shaping. Almost every language community has its own language-native GUI toolkit project, and most fall short. I do believe that Rust will be different, and seeing projects like this is to me evidence why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, if I could have one wishlist from the Rust language, it would be proper keyword arguments, as the builder pattern feels clunky, and the struct-with-default pattern is no better. But overall there’s a lot to be said for the language itself basically being stable, and the primary focus being on implementation, tools, and ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-2021&quot;&gt;To 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUI is a hard problem, but the Rust community has a track record of solving hard problems, even if the journey is sometimes long. I find the progress so far impressive, both in Druid and other related projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my sincere hope that 2021 will be a year of recovery from trauma, re-building what has been lost, and building new and better things. I’m looking forward to the work on Druid and Runebender, and walking with the Rust community on the journey, hopefully ultimately towards my most ambitious vision of what a high-performance, richly expressive GUI toolkit could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on Druid and Runebender is generously funded by Google Fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com&quot;&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt; (the &quot;friendly interactive shell&quot;) has the explicit goal of being more user-friendly than other shells. It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box (all with no configuration required). Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn't care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path. Since our &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/575002/&quot;&gt;last look&lt;/a&gt; at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users. Some of the biggest additions landed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.0.0&quot;&gt;3.0 release&lt;/a&gt;, but we will also describe some other notable changes from version 2.1 up through latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/832882/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/fish-shell-sm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;[Fish shell]&quot; title=&quot;Fish shell&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first release of fish was made by Axel Liljencrantz in February 2005. Version 2.0 was released in September 2013, and 3.0 in December 2018. The latest version, 3.1.2, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.1.2&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; on April 29, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Logical operators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 3.0 release, fish lacked a special syntax to express logical AND (&amp;amp;&amp;amp;) and OR (||) operations. Instead, the &lt;tt&gt;and&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;or&lt;/tt&gt; commands were used for such operations. These commands verify the previous command's exit status before acting accordingly. For example, &lt;tt&gt;command1; and command2&lt;/tt&gt; expresses a logical AND operation in which &lt;tt&gt;command2&lt;/tt&gt; is executed if, and only if, &lt;tt&gt;command1&lt;/tt&gt; returns an exit status of zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax proved to be unpopular among converts from other shells where operators such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; were used to express logical operations and it was the subject of several &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/150&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; on the project's issue tracker. Due to popular demand, these logical operators are now supported as of fish 3.0 to make it easier to migrate from other shells. It is now possible to enter &lt;tt&gt;command1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; command2&lt;/tt&gt; in the shell or in a script to express the logical AND operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;History and incognito mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a command is executed in the shell, it is inserted at the end of the history file located at &lt;tt&gt;~/.local/share/fish/fish_history&lt;/tt&gt;, accompanied by the timestamp of its entry. It is also possible to save a command to the history without executing it using the Alt+# binding (introduced in version 2.3.0). It toggles the current command line between commented and uncommented states. As with Bash and other shells, the up or down arrow keys can be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#history-search&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; forward or backward in the history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice feature for fish history is the ability to filter through the history based on what is typed into the shell. Entering a few characters and then hitting the up arrow key performs a history search for the commands that include the typed characters. For example, typing &lt;tt&gt;git&lt;/tt&gt; and hitting the up arrow will display only the commands that contain the string &lt;tt&gt;git&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish does not enter any command that begins with a space into its history file, essentially treating it like an incognito command. This often surprises users who are transitioning to fish from Bash or other shells that do not have this behavior; it is also easy to activate it unintentionally when pasting commands to the terminal from other sources. There have been several &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4327&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; in GitHub issues on whether to retain this behavior in future releases and how to make it more discoverable. As of fish 3.1.2, no changes have been made to this aspect of the shell behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new addition in fish 3.0 is the &lt;tt&gt;--private&lt;/tt&gt; flag that can be used to start fish in private mode; it stops all subsequent commands from being logged in the history file. This is handy for when a user wants to enter sensitive information in a command. The &lt;tt&gt;$fish_private_mode&lt;/tt&gt; variable was also added for the purpose of detecting if a script is being run in private mode so that its behavior may be modified accordingly to respect the user's wish for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aliases and abbreviations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other shells, fish provides the ability to define memorable alternate names (known as aliases) for commonly used commands. Aliases can help to eliminate a great deal of typing when working in the command line. There are two ways to create aliases in fish. The first involves creating a function wrapping a command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    function gc
      git commit $argv
    end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to use the &lt;tt&gt;alias&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, which is essentially a shell wrapper for the function syntax above. When using this syntax, the &lt;tt&gt;$argv&lt;/tt&gt; arguments string will be appended automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    alias gc=&quot;git commit&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of fish 2.2 brought support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/abbr.html&quot;&gt;abbreviations&lt;/a&gt; to the shell. These are similar to standard aliases, but expand inline to the full command when typed. For example, a command can be shortened to &lt;tt&gt;yul&lt;/tt&gt; using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
   abbr yul &quot;yarn upgrade --latest&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;tt&gt;yul&lt;/tt&gt; is entered into the terminal followed by the space or enter key, it will be expanded into the full command. By default, abbreviations are stored to the universal scope, so they immediately become available in all current fish sessions and subsequent ones as well. To make an abbreviation visible in the current session only, use the (surprisingly named) &lt;tt&gt;--global&lt;/tt&gt; flag when creating it. This places the abbreviation in the global scope which is local to the current shell. Abbreviations are generally better than aliases because the full command can be seen before executing it, which makes it easier to edit for a one-off change. They are also more suitable for interactive demos or presentations because the instructor can use a shortcut without obscuring the full command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vi mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default key bindings used by fish for moving the cursor around on the command line are from the Emacs editor. Examples are Ctrl+A to move the cursor to the start of a command, Ctrl+E to move to the end of a command, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#emacs-mode-commands&quot;&gt;and so on&lt;/a&gt;. Fish 2.2 introduced a Vi mode for those who prefer bindings from the Vi editor. It supports command mode, insert mode, and visual mode &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#vi-mode-command&quot;&gt;bindings&lt;/a&gt;. Fish also provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#shared-bindings&quot;&gt;shared bindings&lt;/a&gt; that are accessible regardless of your preferred mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If neither mode is sufficient for a particular edit, an external editor may be summoned using the Alt+E or Alt+V shortcuts. The two commands are synonymous; the editor is chosen from the first available of the &lt;tt&gt;$VISUAL&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/tt&gt; environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clipboard integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish features an Emacs-style &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/The-Kill-Ring.html&quot;&gt;kill ring&lt;/a&gt; for blocks of text that were previously killed. For example, Ctrl+U cuts from the cursor position to the start of the line and inserts the text into the kill ring while Ctrl+Y pastes the latest value from the kill ring at the cursor position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change in Fish 2.4 is that any text cut with kill ring commands no longer overrides the system clipboard. This behavior was changed because it was a common source of frustration when pasting to the shell from external sources because cutting some text would override the previously copied text meaning that it would have to be copied again. Working with the system clipboard is still supported on Linux (X11 and Wayland) and macOS. Ctrl+X is used to copy the whole line to the clipboard (regardless of cursor position) and Ctrl+V pastes from the clipboard to the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Web configuration tool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web configuration tool, launched with &lt;tt&gt;fish_config&lt;/tt&gt;, provides a nice way to customize the prompt style, color theme, and so on. An important security enhancement landed in 2.1.1 which prevents a remote-code-execution attack when running this web interface by using an authentication token to protect requests and responding only to requests that include this token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the behavior of this tool was changed slightly in version 3.1 by causing it to display a list of the commands it is executing, for debugging purposes. Other improvements include new theme presets, base-16 color options, prompt styles, and support for viewing, editing, and adding abbreviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/832525/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/fish-config-sm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;[Fish configuration tool]&quot; title=&quot;Fish configuration tool&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wrap it up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish was originally implemented in C but is now primarily written in C++. It does not follow any particular release cycle but major versions usually take a few years to come out. The best way to follow the development of the shell is through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/fish/lists/fish-users&quot;&gt;official mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. The changes that are being planned for upcoming releases are detailed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones&quot;&gt;milestones&lt;/a&gt; page on GitHub. An official &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/fish-shell/fish-shell&quot;&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; also exists for community discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the refinements being made continue the process of making fish easier and more convenient to use compared to other shells. It strikes a good balance between having useful defaults to get started with immediately and leaving room for extensibility and customizability. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is available for those looking to quickly get up to speed with the precise differences between fish and more traditional shells.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Compact nuclear fusion reactor is &amp;#039;very likely to work,&amp;#039; studies suggest</title>

That reactor has been under construction since 2013 and, although it is not designed to generate electricity, is expected to produce a fusion reaction by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Bob Mumgaard, Commonwealth Fusion’s chief executive and one of the company’s founders, said a goal of the Sparc project was to develop fusion in time for it to play a role in mitigating global warming. “We’re really focused on how you can get to fusion power as quickly as possible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Fusion, in which lightweight atoms are brought together at temperatures of tens of millions of degrees to release energy, has been held out as a way for the world to address the climate-change implications of electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like a conventional nuclear fission power plant that splits atoms, a fusion plant would not burn fossil fuels and would not produce greenhouse-gas emissions. But its fuel, usually isotopes of hydrogen, would be far more plentiful than the uranium used in most nuclear plants, and fusion would generate less, and less dangerous, radioactivity and waste than fission plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the hurdles to building a machine that can create and control a fusion plasma — a roiling ultrahot cloud of atoms that will damage or destroy anything it touches — are enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some scientists who have worked on fusion energy for decades say that while they are enthusiastic about the prospects for Sparc, the timetable may be unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Reading these papers gives me the sense that they’re going to have the controlled thermonuclear fusion plasma that we all dream about,” said Cary Forest, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin who is not involved in the project. “But if I were to estimate where they’re going to be, I’d give them a factor of two that I give to all my grad students when they say how long something is going to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sparc would be far smaller than ITER — about the size of a tennis court, compared with a soccer field, Dr. Mumgaard said — and far less expensive than the international effort, which is officially estimated to cost about $22 billion but may end up being far costlier. Commonwealth Fusion, which was founded in 2018 and has about 100 employees, has raised $200 million so far, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0&quot; aria-label=&quot;media&quot; role=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media=&quot;(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;disable=upscale&amp;amp;width=600&quot;/&gt;&lt;source media=&quot;(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;disable=upscale&amp;amp;width=1200&quot;/&gt;&lt;source media=&quot;(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;disable=upscale&amp;amp;width=1800&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Sparc fusion energy machine would be relatively small, as shown by this rendering of the reaction chamber.&quot; class=&quot;css-1m50asq&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;disable=upscale&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;auto=webp 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/science/29CLI-FUSION02/29CLI-FUSION02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;disable=upscale&quot;/&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-1l44abu ewdxa0s0&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The Sparc fusion energy machine would be relatively small, as shown by this rendering of the reaction chamber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;T.

Fusion power has always seemed to be “just decades” away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That might turn out to be true in this case as well. But in seven peer-reviewed papers published Tuesday in a special issue of The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of Plasma Physics&lt;/a&gt;, researchers laid out the evidence that Sparc would succeed and produce as much as 10 times the energy it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The research “confirms that the design we’re working on is very likely to work,” said Martin Greenwald, deputy director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center and one of the project’s lead scientists. Dr. Greenwald is a founder of Commonwealth Fusion but has no current affiliation with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sparc employs the same kind of device as ITER: a tokamak, or doughnut-shaped chamber inside which the fusion reaction takes place. Because the plasma cloud is so hot — hotter than the sun — it must be confined by magnetic forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;ITER does this using huge electromagnetic coils that contain superconducting wires that must be cooled by liquid helium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sparc takes advantage of a newer electromagnet technology that uses so-called high temperature superconductors that can produce a much higher magnetic field, Dr. Greenwald said. As a result, the plasma is much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The papers show “this high-field path still looks viable,” Dr. Greenwald said. “If we can overcome the engineering challenges, this machine will perform as we predict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Fusion said it would announce a location for Sparc in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is just one of a number of companies working to develop and commercialize fusion power in partnership with research institutions, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars of investment money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://tae.com/fusion-power/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TAE Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which is based in Southern California, is working on a design that uses a linear device that shoots two clouds of plasma at each other to generate fusion. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://firstlightfusion.com/technology/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;First Light Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, a spinoff of the University of Oxford in England, uses energy to compress and collapse the fusion fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Forest said that by using stronger magnetic fields, Sparc ended up with what he called a “conservative” design. “That distinguishes it totally from all of the start-ups, which are by definition more edgy and higher risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;William Dorland, a physicist at the University of Maryland and editor of The Journal of Plasma Physics, said the journal had asked some of these fusion projects “to tell us their physics basis.” The M.I.T. and Commonwealth Fusion group quickly said yes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“From my perspective, it’s the first of these groups that have private money that actually is saying very clearly what they’re doing,” Dr. Dorland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Reasonable people disagree about whether it works,” he said. “I’m just happy that they stepped up and are telling us in normal science speak what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<title>Writing a book: is it worth it?</title>

<description>&lt;a class=&quot;twitter-share-button&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/share&quot; data-text=&quot;Writing a book: is it worth it?&quot; data-via=&quot;martinkl&quot; data-related=&quot;martinkl&quot; data-size=&quot;large&quot; data-count=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published by Martin Kleppmann on 29 Sep 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataintensive.net/&quot;&gt;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&lt;/a&gt;, recently passed the milestone of 100,000 copies sold. Last year, it was the second-best-selling book in O’Reilly’s entire catalogue, second only to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=dataintensive-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d47ed0da85dc67659afbfbbad99f6ec&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;Aurélien Géron’s machine learning book&lt;/a&gt;. Machine learning is obviously a hot topic, so I am quite content with coming second to it! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the success of this book was totally unexpected: while I was writing it, I thought that it was going to be a bit niche, and I set myself the goal of selling 10,000 copies over the lifetime of the book. Having passed that goal tenfold, this seems like a good opportunity to look back and reflect on the process. I don’t want to make this post too self-congratulatory, but rather I will try to share some insights into the business of book-writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-financially-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is it financially worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most books make very little money for both authors and publishers, but then occasionally something like &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; comes along. If you are considering writing a book, I strongly recommend that you estimate the value of your future royalties to be close to zero. Like starting a band with friends and hoping to become rock stars, it’s difficult to predict in advance what will be a hit and what will flop. Maybe this applies less to technical books than to fiction and music, but I suspect that even with technical books, there are a small number of hits, and most books sell quite modest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, in my case, I am happy to report that writing this book has in retrospect turned out to be a financially sound decision. These graphs show the royalties I have been paid since the book first went on sale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/royalties-cumulative.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; alt=&quot;Cumulative royalties chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/royalties-monthly.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; alt=&quot;Monthly royalties chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 2½ years the book was in “early release”: during this period I was still writing, and we released it in unedited form, one chapter at a time, as ebook only. Then in March 2017 the book was officially published, and the print edition went on sale. Since then, the sales have fluctuated from month to month, but on average they have stayed remarkably constant. At some point I would expect the market to become saturated (i.e. most people who were going to buy the book have already bought it), but that does not seem to have happened yet: indeed, sales noticeably increased in late 2018 (I don’t know why). The x axis ends in July 2020 because from the time of sale, it takes a couple of months for the money to trickle through the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contract with the publisher specifies that I get 25% of publisher revenue from ebooks, online access, and licensing, 10% of revenue from print sales, and 5% of revenue from translations. That’s a percentage of the wholesale price that retailers/distributors pay to the publisher, so it doesn’t include the retailers’ markup. The figures in this section are the royalties I was paid, after the retailer and publisher have taken their cut, but before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total sales since the beginning have been (in US dollars):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Print: 68,763 copies, $161,549 royalties ($2.35/book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ebook: 33,420 copies, $169,350 royalties ($5.07/book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O’Reilly online access (formerly called Safari Books Online): $110,069 royalties (I don’t get readership numbers for this channel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dataintensive.net/translations.html&quot;&gt;Translations&lt;/a&gt;: 5,896 copies, $8,278 royalties ($1.40/book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other licensing and sponsorship: $34,600 royalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total: 108,079 copies, $477,916&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of money, but I also put a lot of time into it! I estimate that I spent about 2.5 years of full-time equivalent work researching and writing the book, spread out over the course of 4 years. Of that time, I spent one year (2014–15) working full-time on the book without income, while the rest of the time I worked on the book part-time alongside part-time employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in retrospect, it turns out that those 2.5 years were a good investment, because the income that this work has generated is in the same ballpark as the Silicon Valley software engineering salary (including stock and benefits) I could have received in the same time if I hadn’t quit LinkedIn in 2014 to work on the book. But of course I didn’t know that at the time! The royalties could easily have turned out to be a factor of 10 lower, in which case it would have been a financially much less compelling proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-the-royalties&quot;&gt;Beyond the royalties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the success of my book might also be explained by the fact that I put a lot of effort into promoting it. Since the book went into early release I have given &lt;a href=&quot;https://martin.kleppmann.com/talks.html&quot;&gt;almost 50 talks&lt;/a&gt; at major conferences, plus a bunch of additional invited talks at companies and universities. Every single talk contained at least a small advertisement for my book. Like a band going on tour to promote their latest album, I suspect these talks contributed to the book being widely known. A couple of my blog posts have also been quite popular, and these may also have brought the book to potential readers’ attention. I have now significantly dialled back my speaking commitments, so I assume it is mostly spreading via word of mouth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intensivedata/likes&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, and readers recommending it to their colleagues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of talks and the book have allowed me to establish a significant public presence and reputation in this field. I now get far more invitations to speak at conferences than I can realistically accept. Conference talks don’t generate income &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; (good industry conferences generally pay for speakers’ travel and accommodation, but they rarely pay speaking fees), but this kind of reputation is helpful for getting consulting gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only done a bit of consulting (and I now regularly turn down consulting requests from companies because I’m focussing on my research), but I suspect that in my current position it would be fairly easy to establish a lucrative consulting and training business, going into companies and helping them with their data infrastructure problems. That is further financial value that writing a book can bring: you become recognised as an expert and an authority in an area, and companies will pay good money to get advice from such experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have focussed a lot on the financial viability of writing a book because I believe that books are an extremely valuable educational resource (more on this below). I want more people to write books, and that requires book-writing to be a sustainable activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to spend a great deal of time doing background research for my book because I was able to afford to live without a salary for a year, but many people will not be able to do that. If people can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/who-pays-to-educate-developers-/&quot;&gt;paid fairly for creating educational materials&lt;/a&gt;, we will get more and better educational materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economics of book-writing are challenging, and I reiterate that the success of my book is atypical. However, I also find it heartening that it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to make a decent living from technical writing. Not guaranteed, but possible, and that gives me hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-book-is-accessible-education&quot;&gt;A book is accessible education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides financial value to the author, there are lots of other good things about writing books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book is universally &lt;strong&gt;accessible&lt;/strong&gt;: it is affordable to almost everyone, anywhere in the world. It is vastly cheaper than a university course or corporate training, and you don’t have to move to another city to take advantage of it. People in rural areas and developing countries can benefit equally to those living in the global centres of tech. You can skim it or read it carefully cover to cover, as you please. You don’t even need an internet connection to use it. Of course it doesn’t confer all of the benefits of a university education (such as individual feedback, credentials, professional network, social life), but as a medium for communicating knowledge, a book is almost unbeatably efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are also plenty of free resources online: Wikipedia, blog posts, videos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, research papers, and so on. These are good as reference material for answering a concrete question that you have (such as “what are the parameters of the function foo?”), but they are piecemeal fragments that are difficult to assemble into a coherent education. On the other hand, a good book provides a carefully selected and designed programme of study, and a narrative that is particularly valuable when you are trying to make sense of a complex topic for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to teaching people in person, a book is vastly more scalable. Even if I lecture in my university’s largest lecture theatre for the rest of my career, I will not get anywhere near teaching 100,000 people. For individual and small-group teaching, the disparity is greater still. Yet a book is able to reach such large numbers of people routinely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-more-value-than-you-capture&quot;&gt;Creating more value than you capture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a book is an activity that &lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html&quot;&gt;creates more value than it captures&lt;/a&gt;. What I mean with this is that the benefits that readers get from it are greater than the price they paid for the book. To back this up, let’s try roughly estimating the value created by my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100,000 people who have bought my book so far, let’s say that two thirds of them intend to read it but actually haven’t got round to it yet. Of those who have read it, let’s say that one third were able to actually apply some of the ideas in the book, and two thirds read it purely out of interest. So let’s say conservatively that 10% of people who bought the book, that is 10,000 people, have applied it for some useful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might such a useful purpose look like? In the case of my book, much of it is about making architectural decisions regarding data storage. If you get them right, you can build some amazing systems; if you get them wrong, you have to spend ages painfully digging yourself out of a mess that you got yourself into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to quantify that, but let’s say that the people who applied ideas from the book avoided a bad decision that would have taken them one month of engineering time to rectify. (I’d actually love to claim that the time saving is much higher, but let’s be conservative in our estimates.) Thus, the 10,000 readers who applied the knowledge freed up an estimated 10,000 months, or 833 years, of engineering time to spend on things that are more useful than digging yourself out of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I spend 2.5 years writing a book, and it saves other people 833 years of time in aggregate, that is over 300x leverage. If we assume an average engineering salary on the order of $100k, that’s $80m of value created. Readers have spent approximately $4m buying those 100,000 books, so the value created is about 20 times greater than the value captured. And this is based on some very conservative estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are further ways in which the book creates value. For example, lots of readers have sent me emails and tweets saying that because they read my book, they did well in a job interview, landing them their dream job and providing financial security for their family. I don’t know how to measure that sort of value created, but I think it’s tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to be a 10x engineer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peterseibel/status/512615519934230528&quot;&gt;help ten other engineers be twice as good&lt;/a&gt;. Producing high-quality educational materials enables you to be a 300x engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a technical book is not easy, but it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;valuable (it helps people be better at their job),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scalable (large numbers of people can benefit from it),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessible (it doesn’t discriminate who can benefit), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economically viable (it is possible to generate a reasonable level of income from it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to compare it to working on open source software, another activity that can have significant positive impact but is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=nav_signin&amp;amp;&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=dataintensive-20&amp;amp;linkId=a152ade47ab23a9351d3e24950a89515&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;difficult to get paid for&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t have a strong opinion on this at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, writing a book is really hard, at least if you want to do it well. For me it was about the same level of difficulty as building and selling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rapportive&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; (YMMV), that is to say, involving multiple existential crises. The writing process was not good for my mental health. For that reason I haven’t rushed into writing another book: the scars from writing the first one are still too fresh. But the scars gradually do fade, and I’m hoping (perhaps naively) that it might be easier next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On balance, I do think that writing a technical book is worth it. The feeling of knowing that you have helped a lot of people is gratifying. The personal growth that comes from taking on such a challenge is also considerable. And there is no better way to learn something in depth than by explaining it to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post I will provide some advice on writing and publishing from my experience so far.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;3. Increased social rigidity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186&quot;&gt;social credit score&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records, what they say on social media, what they buy, and even the scores of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a low score you can't get a government job, visa, cheap loan, or even a nice online date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social pressure is the most powerful and most subtle form of control.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Epic’s decision to bypass Apple’s App Store policies was dishonest, says judge</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;UJ1oBp&quot;&gt;A US judge hearing arguments in Epic’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple has criticized the game developer’s decision to breach its contract with the iPhone maker by pushing a version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with a custom payment system onto the App Store. The decision resulted in Apple removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OE06w7&quot;&gt;During a hearing on Monday with both companies, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California expressed skepticism about Epic’s arguments, particularly its claim that it did not pose a security threat to Apple because it is a well-established company and partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;nbG8aU&quot;&gt;“You did something, you lied about it by omission, by not being forthcoming. That’s the security issue. That’s the security issue!” Rogers told Epic, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/28/tech/apple-fortnite-epic-hearing/index.html&quot;&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There are a lot of people in the public who consider you guys heroes for what you guys did, but it’s still not honest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k3Ltsg&quot;&gt;The three-hour hearing, which took place over Zoom, did not settle any of the open questions in Epic’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Apple, including whether or not &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be allowed to return temporarily to the App Store. A decision on that issue is expected “in the coming days,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/apple-epic-app-court.html&quot;&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TNB08g&quot;&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers did recommend, though, that the case be taken to a jury trial in July next year to settle these issues permanently. “It is important enough to understand what real people think,” said Rogers. “Do these security issues concern people or not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bdCKbk&quot;&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;, Judge Rogers said she was “not particularly persuaded” by Epic’s argument that Apple has bundled its App Store and in-app payment system together in violation of antitrust law. The judge also said she did not necessarily agree with Epic that Apple has harmed its ability to distribute &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through its control of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dvatny&quot;&gt;“Walled gardens have existed for decades,” said the judge. “Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple’s doing is not much different... It’s hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you’re asking me to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;s1BsKL&quot;&gt;The lawsuit between Apple and Epic has become a rallying cry for many developers dissatisfied with the iPhone maker’s App Store policies. Last week, companies including Epic, Spotify, Tile, and the Match Group created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest&quot;&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim to “defend the fundamental rights of creators to build apps and to do business directly with their customers,” according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Identifying Airtel middleboxes that censor HTTPS traffic</title>
<link>http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in November 2019, &lt;a target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/reliance-jio-is-using-sni-inspection-to-block-websites&quot;&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; that Reliance Jio is able to block HTTPS internet traffic by means of a deep packet inspection (DPI) technique. In response, some readers messaged us saying that they ran our test and were able to reproduce similar behaviour on Airtel mobile networks. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/PIR_08012020_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TRAI's Performance Indicators report for Jul-Sep 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Reliance Jio and Airtel serve roughly 52% and 23% of internet subscribers in India respectively. &lt;strong&gt;This essentially means that SNI inspection based censorship is now impacting every 3 out of 4 internet connections in India.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the previous test was able to detect the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, it was not very insightful. In this post, we delve into a more informative test which not only confirms the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, but also helps us identify the exact mechanism. Furthermore, it also allows us to identify middleboxes which are actively inspecting SNI in TLS handshakes and censoring requests. &lt;strong&gt;Using this method, we were able to discover 25 different middleboxes registered to Airtel, which are actively censoring HTTPS traffic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick links to different sections of this post:&lt;br/&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secTLS&quot;&gt;Transport Layer Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secSNI&quot;&gt;Server Name Indication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secSNICensor&quot;&gt;SNI Inspection based censorship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secINT&quot;&gt;Iterative Network Tracing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secData&quot;&gt;Data Preparation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secMethod&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secAirtel&quot;&gt;Examining Airtel's behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secRef&quot;&gt;References&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code for replicating this experiment, as well as the logs from our test runs can be found in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI&quot;&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;. Big shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipinfo.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IPinfo&lt;/a&gt; for giving us access to their IP address dataset, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gurshabad.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gurshabad Grover&lt;/a&gt; for his suggestions while ideating the methodology and for editing this post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol for providing communication confidentiality and authenticity, commonly used for encrypting web traffic (as done in HTTPS). Normally TLS is used over TCP, as it requires a reliable in-order data stream. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quick refresher&lt;/a&gt; on TLS by Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OlMYujg.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;A TCP handshake followed by a TLS Handshake. The ClientHello is a message sent by the client, which initiates the TLS handshake. This message can contain extensions such as SNI. Image credits - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;servernameindication&quot;&gt;Server Name Indication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server Name Indication (SNI), defined first in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RFC4366&lt;/a&gt; and then in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RFC6066&lt;/a&gt;, is a TLS extension designed to facilitate the hosting of multiple HTTPS websites on the same IP address. While sending a &lt;code&gt;ClientHello&lt;/code&gt; message (which initiates the establishment of a secure connection), the client is expected to fill in the SNI attribute with the hostname of the website it wishes to connect to. SNI, unfortunately, travels on the network in cleartext, i.e. &lt;strong&gt;network operators can not only see the websites you’re visiting, but also filter traffic based on this information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the SNI present is in cleartext, anyone in the network can inspect and filter traffic based on its value. As seen in other countries, ISPs can leverage this to deny access to certain websites. We can observe the same by attempting a TLS connection using openssl and monitoring packets to the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;openssl s_client -state -connect 103.224.212.222:443 -servername fullhd720.com  
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kush789/INT-SNI/master/images/airtel_103.224.212.222_fullhd720.com.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;An attempted TLS connection to &lt;code&gt;103.224.212.222&lt;/code&gt;, with SNI &lt;code&gt;fullhd720.com&lt;/code&gt;. We observe a RST packet immediately after the ClientHello message containing the SNI is sent.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, using Airtel, we can see that the client receives a TCP RST packet when it tries to connect to a blocked website &quot;fullhd720.com&quot;. The RST packet seems to be originating from the actual host, and is received right after the ClientHello message containing the SNI is sent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/pcaps/airtel_103.224.212.222_fullhd720.com.pcap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PCAP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm that the connection termination was indeed due to the SNI, we can reattempt the connection with a different SNI which we don't expect to be blocked (in this case we use &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;openssl s_client -state -connect 103.224.212.222:443 -servername facebook.com  
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kush789/INT-SNI/master/images/airtel_103.224.212.222_facebook.com.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;An attempted TLS connection to &lt;code&gt;103.224.212.222&lt;/code&gt; with a different SNI, &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, we observe a successful TLS handshake&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we notice a successful connection, indicating that the RST in the previous attempt was indeed due to the specified SNI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/pcaps/airtel_103.224.212.222_facebook.com.pcap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PCAP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this test does demonstrate the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, the packet dumps are not sufficient to prove that the RST packet was actually forged by a middlebox belonging to the ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given host, let's call the minimum Time to Live (&lt;a href=&quot;https://packetpushers.net/ip-time-to-live-and-hop-limit-basics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TTL&lt;/a&gt;) required for a packet to reach from the client to the host, &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt;. Any packet where the TTL set is less than &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt; would expire in transit, and never reach the host. Ideally, the router at which the TTL of the packet expired should respond with an ICMP Time Exceeded (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg11.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICMP message type 11&lt;/a&gt;) message. However, this is not guaranteed, and some routers are even configured to not send them (in order to hide the topology of the network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aSrR375.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Iterative Network Tracing; we send ClientHello messages with increasing TTL. In this particular case, the minimum TTL required is 9. A middlebox which censors requests would send back a censored response even when the TTL is less than 9. Image credits - &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#cite1&quot;&gt;Yadav et al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the RST received is forged by a middlebox, we should receive it even when we send the ClientHello message with TTL less than &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt;. This approach, known as Iterative Network Tracing (INT), has been previously used to ascertain the presence of middleboxes which censor DNS and HTTP traffic in India [&lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#cite1&quot;&gt;Yadav et al.&lt;/a&gt;] and China &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#cite2&quot;&gt;Xu et al.&lt;/a&gt; Similar to these studies, we use INT to detect censorship of TLS traffic (explained further in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamkush.me/sni-airtel/#secMethod&quot;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run our tests using a list of potentially blocked websites (PBWs), curated from leaked court and government orders. The list and more information pertaining to it can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/How-India-Censors-The-Web-Data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Google's DNS over HTTPS (DoH) &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;service&lt;/a&gt;, each hostname was resolved to its correct IP address. Using DoH here is important as it ensures that no DNS based censorship intervenes with the test. This resulted in roughly 5000 (hostname, ip) pairs. Next we selected a random subset and checked for TCP connectivity to port 443 to each of those ips (since not all would support HTTPS traffic), filtering our list down to 1370 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these test points, we establish a TCP connection with the resolved_ip, and send a TLS ClientHello with the SNI set as the correct_hostname. We sniff and save these ClientHello packets (just the SSL layer) for use later. Similarly, we save the ClientHello packet with the SNI set as &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;. These sniffed packets can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/tree/master/tls_client_hellos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input to the test is a 2-tuple, (&lt;code&gt;correct_hostname&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;resolved_ip&lt;/code&gt;). We would like to understand the behaviour of a middlebox when it observes a ClientHello message containing an SNI for a website it wishes to block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we calculate the &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt; for a given test point. We begin by establishing a TCP connection with &lt;code&gt;resolved_ip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;import socket  
import random  
from scapy.all import *

resolved_ip = &quot;103.224.212.222&quot;  
dport = 443 # TLS connection  
sport = random.randint(1024, 65535) # Random source port

def create_connection(resolved_ip):  
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW)
    s.bind((&quot;usb0&quot;, 0)) # Was using a tethered mobile connection for the experiment

    IP_PACKET = IP(dst = resolved_ip)

    seq = random.randint(12345, 67890) # Randomise initial seq number
    SYN = TCP(sport = sport, dport = dport, flags = &quot;S&quot;, seq = seq)
    SYNACK = sr1(IP_PACKET / SYN)
    ACK = TCP(sport = sport, dport = dport, flags = &quot;A&quot;, seq = seq + 1, ack = SYNACK.seq + 1)
    send(IP_PACKET / ACK)
    return IP_PACKET, ACK
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: When the linux kernel feature gets a TCP packet to an unknown socket, it sends a RST back to the originator. Since we'll be creating our own raw sockets, we need to suppress these outbound RSTs from the kernel using iptables before running experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP  
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the TCP connection has been established, we send ClientHello messages (containing &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt; in SNI) after updating the TTL (&lt;code&gt;probe_ttl&lt;/code&gt;) in the underlying IP header. We specify &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt; in the SNI so that the middlebox doesn't attempt to terminate the connection. &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt; would be the minimum TTL at which we receive a TLS ServerHello or TLS Alert from the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;# Load ClientHello with garbled hostname in SNI (sniffed earlier, read Data Preparation)
max_ttl = 35

def find_min_ttl(resolved_ip)

    with open(&quot;tls_client_hellos/facebook.com&quot;, 'rb') as fp:
        tls_client_hello_facebook_com_sni = fp.read()

    for probe_ttl in range(1, max_ttl):
        IP_PACKET, ACK = create_connection(resolved_ip)
        IP_PACKET.ttl = probe_ttl
        del IP_PACKET.chksum # Will force scapy to recalculate checksum after TTL update

        resp, _ = sr(IP_PACKET / ACK / tls_client_hello_facebook_com_sni, timeout = 2, retry = 0, multi = True)

        for _, ans_packet in resp:
            tls_alert = ans_packet.get(tls.TLS, {}).get(tls.TLSAlert)
            tls_server_hello = ans_packet.get(tls.TLS, {}).get(tls.TLSHandshakes, {}).get(tls.TLSServerHello)

            if tls_alert or tls_server_hello:
                return probe_ttl # min_ttl found!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we send ClientHello messages containing the &lt;code&gt;correct_hostname&lt;/code&gt; in the SNI with TTL increasing from 1 to &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt; - 1. If there is no middlebox interfering with the connection, all such requests should receive either an ICMP Time Exceeded in response or no response at all. If at any point we receive an RST packet which seems to be originating from &lt;code&gt;resolved_ip&lt;/code&gt;, we can say with certainty that the packet was forged by a middlebox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;min_ttl = find_min_ttl(resolved_ip, tls_client_hello)

with open(&quot;tls_client_hellos/fullhd720.com&quot;, 'rb') as fp:  
    tls_client_hello_correct_sni = fp.read()

for probe_ttl in range(1, min_ttl):  
    IP_PACKET, ACK = create_connection(resolved_ip)
    IP_PACKET.ttl = probe_ttl
    del IP_PACKET.chksum # Will force scapy to recalculate checksum after TTL update
    resp, _ = sr(IP_PACKET / ACK / tls_client_hello_correct_sni, timeout = 2, retry = 0, multi = True)

    for _, ans_packet in resp:
        icmp_packet = ans_packet.get(ICMP)
        if icmp_packet is not None:
            print (&quot;Found ICMP message of type %d&quot; %(ans_packet[ICMP].type))
            continue

        tcp_packet = ans_packet.get(TCP)
        if tcp_packet and (tcp_packet.flags &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) % 2 == 1:
            print (&quot;Found RST at hop %d&quot; % (probe_ttl))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our methodology, we mine the following information for our each point in our test list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;min_ttl&lt;/strong&gt;: Minimum TTL at which TLS ServerHello / TLS Alert received (if any) in response to a ClientHello with `facebook.com` as SNI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;min_correct_sni_RST&lt;/strong&gt;: Minimum TTL at which RST received (if any) in response to a ClientHello with correct_sni&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;min_correct_sni_TLS&lt;/strong&gt;: Minimum TTL at which TLS ServerHello / TLS Alert received (if any) in response to a ClientHello with correct_sni&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script for running this test can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/runInt.py&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Logs for each test run can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/tree/master/airtel_logs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Code for mining the information above from the logs is present in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/Log%20Analysis.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this python notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our list of 1370 potentially blocked websites, there were &lt;strong&gt;1058&lt;/strong&gt; instances where we received RST packets in response to ClientHellos with &lt;code&gt;correct_sni&lt;/code&gt;. In all of these cases, the RST seemed to be originating from &lt;code&gt;resolved_ip&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;min_correct_sni_RST&lt;/code&gt; was less than &lt;code&gt;min_ttl&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;This implies the presence of a middlebox deliberately terminating connections&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in &lt;strong&gt;170&lt;/strong&gt; cases, we also received ICMP Time Exceeded alerts at the same &lt;code&gt;probe_ttl&lt;/code&gt; at which we received RST packets. On further analysis, we found these RST packets to be originating from 25 unique middleboxes. Checking with ipinfo.io revealed that &lt;strong&gt;16 of these were registered to &lt;code&gt;airtel.com&lt;/code&gt;, and 9 were registered to &lt;code&gt;bhartitelesonic.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. More information regarding these middleboxes can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/Airtel%20middle%20box%20identification.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this python notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;290&lt;/strong&gt; cases, we received TLS ServerHellos / TLS Alerts in response, indicating no network interference. This is expected, since we started with a list of &lt;strong&gt;potentially&lt;/strong&gt; blocked websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above, there were a few test failure due to connectivity issues, which we did not probe further.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amnesty International India Halts Its Work in India Due to Government Reprisal</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://amnesty.org.in/news-update/amnesty-international-india-halts-its-work-on-upholding-human-rights-in-india-due-to-reprisal-from-government-of-india-2/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amnesty International India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bengaluru/ New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; 29 September 2020 10:03 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete freezing of Amnesty International India’s bank accounts by the Government of India which it came to know on 10 September 2020, brings all the work being done by the organization to a grinding halt.  The organisation has been compelled to let go of staff in India and pause all its ongoing campaign and research work. This is latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organizations by the Government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations, Amnesty International India said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The continuing crackdown on Amnesty International India over the last two years and the complete freezing of bank accounts is not accidental. The constant harassment by government agencies including the Enforcement Directorate is a result of our unequivocal calls for transparency in the government, more recently for accountability of the Delhi police and the Government of India regarding the grave human rights violations in Delhi riots and Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir. For a movement that has done nothing but raise its voices against injustice, this latest attack is akin to freezing dissent,” said Avinash Kumar, Executive Director of Amnesty International India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International India stands in full compliance with all applicable Indian and international laws. For human rights work in India, it operates through a distinct model of raising funds domestically. More than four million Indians have supported Amnesty International India’s work in the last eight years and around 100,000 Indians have made financial contributions. These contributions evidently cannot have any relation with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010.  The fact that the Government is now portraying this lawful fundraising model as money-laundering is evidence that the overbroad legal framework is maliciously activated when human rights activists and groups challenge the government’s grave inactions and excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacks on Amnesty International India and other outspoken human rights organizations, activists and human rights defenders is only an extension of the various repressive policies and sustained assault by the government on those who speak truth to power. “Treating human rights organisations like criminal enterprises and dissenting individuals as criminals without any credible evidence is a deliberate attempt by the Enforcement Directorate and Government of India to stoke a climate of fear and dismantle the critical voices in India.  It reeks of fear and repression, ignores the human cost to this crackdown particularly during a pandemic and violates people’s basic rights to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, and association guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and international human rights law. Instead, as a global power and a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, India must fearlessly welcome calls for accountability and justice,” said Avinash Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Nobel Prize winning movement, Amnesty International India holds itself to the highest evidentiary standards. Our work in India, as elsewhere, is to uphold universal human rights and build a global movement of people who take injustice personally. These are the same values that are enshrined in the Constitution of India and flow from a long and rich Indian tradition of pluralism, tolerance and peaceful dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRONOLOGY OF ATTACKS AND HARASSMENT OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL INDIA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 25 October 2018, Amnesty International India endured a 10-hour-long raid as a group of officers from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a financial investigation agency under the Ministry of Finance, entered its premises and locked the gates behind them. Most of the information and documents that were demanded during the search were already available in the public domain or filed with the relevant government authorities. The residence of a Director was also raided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the raid, the bank accounts were also frozen by the ED. As a result, Amnesty International India was forced to let go of a number of its staff, adversely affecting its work in India including with the marginalised communities. Despite the ongoing investigations and before the framing of charges, the Government of India started a smear campaign against Amnesty International India in the country through selective leaking of documents gathered by the ED, to government-aligned media outlets. This resulted in a malicious media trial against the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2019, the Department of Income Tax started sending investigative letters to more than 30 small regular donors. Apparently, the department did not find any irregularities but the process adversely affected the fundraising campaigns of Amnesty International India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, Amnesty International India was denied permission to hold the press conference launch in Srinagar to release its third ‘Lawless Law’ report on the misuse and abuse of Public Safety Act in Jammu and Kashmir. It was forced to digitally release it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 22 October 2019, Amnesty International testified at the US Congressional hearing on the situation of human rights in South Asia with specific focus on Jammu and Kashmir since the unilateral abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 15 November 2019, two weeks after the testimony and amid rumours of impending arrests of the organizations top officials, the offices of Amnesty International India and the residence of one of its directors were raided again by the CBI. The raids were conducted on the basis of a First Information Report filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs over unsubstantiated allegations of suspected violations of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. It suggested investigations be launched under other laws like Prevention of Money Laundering Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 13 April 2020, Amnesty International India called on the Uttar Pradesh Government to stop its intimidation of journalists through use of repressive laws during a pandemic. On 15 April 2020, the Cyber Crime Police Station, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh notified Twitter to furnish information about Amnesty International India’s Twitter account @AIIndia which the organization uses to monitor and analyse developments in international human rights law and Indian constitutional and criminal law related to human rights issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 5 August 2020, marking the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, Amnesty International India released an update on the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 28 August 2020, marking the six-month anniversary of the riots that took place in North-East Delhi in February 2020, Amnesty International India released an investigative brief on the complicity of Delhi police in the riots which claimed the lives of at least 53 people, mostly from the minority Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the two publications has provided fresh impetus to the establishment to harass and intimidate Amnesty International India through its investigative agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 10 September 2020 Amnesty International India came to know that all its bank accounts were completely frozen by the Enforcement Directorate bringing most of the work of the human rights organization to a grinding halt.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Samsung TV owners complain about increasingly obtrusive ads</title>
<link>https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1583755244</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1583755244</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
In the beginning, Samsung TV owners were seeing ads for new streaming content, apps or Samsung products. Owners are now complaining about larger, increasingly obtrusive, and unrelated ads.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ads in your TV interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Sometime in 2016 Samsung began pushing a software update to enable ads in the user interface of previously acquired Smart TVs as well as new TVs. The ads were shown above a new icon in the bottom menu.

The move upset some owners of Samsung TVs while others accepted it. Back then, the ads related mostly to new services (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://adage.com/article/digital/samsung-smart-tv-update-forces-ads/307246&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GameFly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), new content from close partners (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/peteryates/b44b70d19ccd52f62d66cdd4bcef1e52&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play or Amazon Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), new movies in theaters (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/co5aw4/unremovable_ads_on_my_2500_samsung_smart_tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angry Birds 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Samsung's own services (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a863a45b7411c7ee11b73e5/1577751097175-0ISZZVBE5NKEHWMBVS6F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJm9ulcpndi6KKE7fqgaM4AUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dlHfO4o__ZVqrcVdxABjT9ERmwjpv6GUilbHAGXH8A7HCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/samsung-tv-mockup-web.png?format=2500w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TV Plus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) or its own products (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://image-us.samsung.com/SamsungUS/samsungbusiness/samsung-ads/home/101619/sa-homepage-our-foundation-v3.jpg?$bu-two-column-desktop-jpg$&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy smartphones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

Towards the end of 2019, owners have started to voice their dissatisfaction with larger, increasingly obtrusive, and unrelated ads showing up on their Samsung TVs. These include ads for canned beans or discount supermarkets such as the one embedded below or the one shared on Samsung's &lt;a href=&quot;https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/TV/Ads-on-TV/td-p/536686/page/3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;community boards here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; readability=&quot;3.7671232876712&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I own Samsung's $2500 &quot;Frame&quot; art TV and it gets ads in the menus too &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/P2OJ5MkhlW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/P2OJ5MkhlW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Internet of Shit (@internetofshit) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/1235727016596590593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 6, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Industry's &quot;largest data set&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
On its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/&quot; target=&quot;_Blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;webpage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; intended for business partners, Samsung boasts that is has 50 million Smart TVs in operation and that it has the &quot;industry’s largest ACR data set&quot;.

What is ACR? It is short for Automatic Content Recognition and it means that the TV uses identification technology to analyze and recognize the content displayed on the screen at any time. It is used to build a personal profile of you and your interests in order to serve &quot;native ads on the home screen&quot; and &quot;video ads on Samsung TV Plus&quot; as well as ads &quot;on the biggest to the smallest screens&quot;. In other words ads that venture beyond your TV.

There is apparently no way to deactivate the ads. 

- &lt;em&gt;&quot;In general, the banner cannot be deactivated in the Smart Hub. We thank you for your feedback and assure you that Samsung takes customer feedback into account in product development,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Samsung Germany said in response to the tweet.


&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung is not alone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Samsung is not alone here. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1554707566&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google pushed a new 'sponsored' row to the home screen of Android TV. It affects TVs from Sony and others.

Panasonic has been experimenting with showing ads when you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1416894724&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adjust audio volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and European broadcasters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1477479820&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using HbbTV to serve targeted ads. LG introduced an ad above its webOS menu but it was later removed. Roku is hard at work turning its TV platform into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1532418306&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;next-generation ad platform&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while Amazon has been showing ads on FireTV devices for years. Most of these platforms have also been confirmed to use ACR, just like Samsung.

So what is the alternative? Apple's tvOS platform (in Apple TV) does not use ACR and its &quot;ads&quot; are limited to content recommendations from apps such as the Apple TV app. These recommendations can be deactivated and users can remove the app from the top row.
