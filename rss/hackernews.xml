<title>Companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The millions of dots on the map trace highways, side streets and bike trails — each one following the path of an anonymous cellphone user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;One path tracks someone from a home outside Newark to a nearby Planned Parenthood, remaining there for more than an hour. Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Yet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin’s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist’s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend’s home, information she found disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don’t want people to know,” said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Like many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people’s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people’s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States — about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times — a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company — reveals people’s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Learn how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/prevent-location-data-sharing.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Intentional&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot;&gt;stop apps from tracking your location&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;These companies sell, use or analyze the data to cater to advertisers, retail outlets and even hedge funds seeking insights into consumer behavior. It’s a hot market, with sales of location-targeted advertising reaching an &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.biakelsey.com/product/2018-u-s-local-mobile-local-social-ad-forecast&quot; title=&quot;BIA Advisory Services forecast&quot;&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; $21 billion this year. IBM has gotten into the industry, with its purchase of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/mcdonalds-watson-advertising&quot;&gt;the Weather Channel’s apps&lt;/a&gt;. The social network Foursquare &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/02/foursquare-raises-33-million-for-ad-and-location-analytics/&quot;&gt;remade itself&lt;/a&gt; as a location marketing company. Prominent investors in location start-ups include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180518005397/en/Cuebiq-Raises-27-Million-Growth-Capital&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.safegraph.com/safegraph-raises-16-million-series-a-e8e88eeb7beb&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt;, the PayPal co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone’s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data — including employees or clients — could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person’s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Location information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person’s life — whether you’ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s very scary,” said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. “It feels like someone is following me, personally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Retailers look to tracking companies to tell them about their own customers and their competitors’. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVZc86CZovU&quot;&gt;a web seminar&lt;/a&gt; last year, Elina Greenstein, an executive at the location company GroundTruth, mapped out the path of a hypothetical consumer from home to work to show potential clients how tracking could reveal a person’s preferences. For example, someone may search online for healthy recipes, but GroundTruth can see that the person often eats at fast-food restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“We look to understand who a person is, based on where they’ve been and where they’re going, in order to influence what they’re going to do next,” Ms. Greenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Financial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings — seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer’s stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Health care facilities are among the more enticing but troubling areas for tracking, as Ms. Lee’s reaction demonstrated. Tell All Digital, a Long Island advertising firm that is a client of a location company, says it runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613127311/digital-ambulance-chasers-law-firms-send-ads-to-patients-phones-inside-ers&quot;&gt;ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt; for personal injury lawyers targeting people anonymously in emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“The book ‘1984,’ we’re kind of living it in a lot of ways,” said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant — even crime scenes — appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Two location firms, Fysical and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.safegraph.com/inauguration-attendees-make-significantly-less-money-than-womens-march-attendees-7cb8b056556a&quot;&gt;SafeGraph&lt;/a&gt;, mapped people attending the 2017 presidential inauguration. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/fysicalblog/the-2017-womens-march-in-washington-had-3x-the-attendance-as-trump-s-inauguration-267fc7f6968c&quot;&gt;On Fysical’s map&lt;/a&gt;, a bright red box near the Capitol steps indicated the general location of President Trump and those around him, cellphones pinging away. Fysical’s chief executive said in an email that the data it used was anonymous. SafeGraph did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More than 1,000 popular apps contain location-sharing code from such companies, according to 2018 data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mightysignal.com/&quot;&gt;MightySignal&lt;/a&gt;, a mobile analysis firm. Google’s Android system was found to have about 1,200 apps with such code, compared with about 200 on Apple’s iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;To evaluate location-sharing practices, The Times tested 20 apps, most of which had been flagged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appcensus.mobi/&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; and industry insiders as potentially sharing the data. Together, 17 of the apps sent exact latitude and longitude to about 70 businesses. Precise location data from one app, WeatherBug on iOS, was received by 40 companies. When contacted by The Times, some of the companies that received that data described it as “unsolicited” or “inappropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;WeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users’ permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn’t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/location-tracking-apps-privacy.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Intentional&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot;&gt;how The Times analyzed location tracking companies&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“There are really no consequences” for companies that don’t protect the data, he said, “other than bad press that gets forgotten about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Companies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Brian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. “You are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,” he said, adding, “You would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. “I guess that’s what they have to tell themselves,” she said of the companies. “But come on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Ms. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes — helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts — and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to “analyze industry trends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help “recommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.” The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a “quick introduction to certain key product features” and that the full uses of the data were described in the app’s privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate “privacy settings” section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called “location settings” made no mention of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The app did not explicitly disclose that the company had also analyzed the data for hedge funds — a pilot program that was promoted on the company’s website. An IBM spokesman said the pilot had ended. (IBM &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/en-US/twc/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;updated the app’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 5, after queries from The Times, to say that it might share aggregated location data for commercial purposes such as analyzing foot traffic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Even industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don’t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Most people don’t know what’s going on,” said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Many location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users’ privacy, but policies vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;For example, Sense360, which focuses on the restaurant industry, says it &lt;a href=&quot;https://sense360.com/portfolio/additional-information-protect-user-privacy/&quot;&gt;scrambles data&lt;/a&gt; within a 1,000-foot square around the device’s approximate home location. Another company, Factual, says that it collects data from consumers at home, but that its database doesn’t contain their addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Several people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn’t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It “would take an enormous amount of resources,” said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users’ locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“You can’t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,” Ms. Mithal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Apps form the backbone of this new location data economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Targeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Google and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don’t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Smaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Apple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations “a few times an hour,” instead of continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Apple has been stricter, for example requiring apps to justify collecting location details in pop-up messages. But Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/requesting-permission/&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for writing these pop-ups do not mention advertising or data sale, only features like getting “estimated travel times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Apple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The discussion served as a “warning shot” to people in the location industry, David Shim, chief executive of the location company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.placed.com/&quot;&gt;Placed&lt;/a&gt;, said at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExDwELoLAJ8&quot;&gt;an industry event&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I went through all their phones and just told them: ‘You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,’” Ms. Lee said. “Nobody knew.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Satariano contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Why Not to Use Quora</title>
<link>https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Quora &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124849/quora-100-million-user-hack-name-email-messages?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that 100 million user accounts were compromised, including private activity like downvotes and direct messages, by a “malicious third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data breaches are a frustrating part of the lifecycle of every online service — as they grow in popularity, they become a bigger and bigger target. Nearly every major online service has had a security breach: Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, Tumblr, Uber, Evernote, eBay, Adobe, Target, and Sony all extensively leaked user data in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security breaches like these are a strong argument for using a password manager, but not a compelling reason to avoid a service you love, unless you plan to quit the internet entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this does seem like a good time to remind you of all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reasons why you should never, ever use Quora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hoarding Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://konklone.com/post/quora-keeps-the-worlds-knowledge-for-itself&quot;&gt;Eric Mill&lt;/a&gt; wrote about Quora’s tendency to hoard knowledge, and nothing’s changed since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/about&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;, “Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge.” With 300 million monthly users, and nearly 40 million questions asked so far, they’re doing a good job of growing the world’s knowledge, but a terrible job of sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Quora’s value is derived from the answers provided by its users, and they go to great lengths to make a well-designed platform for finding and replying to questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they do &lt;strong&gt;everything they can&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure you can’t get those contributions back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quora has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No public API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No backup or export tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted access to answers without an account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocked scrapers and unofficial APIs, and deleted questions related to scraping on their site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with Q&amp;amp;A competitors Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, which offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, a wealth of user-made tools and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackapps.com/&quot;&gt;support community&lt;/a&gt; for it, a powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt; for querying and exporting data, a liberal crawling policy, and doesn’t attempt to hide questions and answers behind authentication. They even proactively upload &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/stackexchange&quot;&gt;anonymized data dumps&lt;/a&gt; of all user-contributed content to the Internet Archive for posterity under a Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://ask.metafilter.com/&quot;&gt;Ask MetaFilter&lt;/a&gt; lets you export your history, and that was mostly built by one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blocking Preservation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be generous, you could argue that it’s not a priority for them to build features like an API or export tools, especially as they’re still struggling to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for years, Quora has also explicitly forbidden the Internet Archive from indexing their site. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/*/quora.com&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is what you’ll see if you try to find any Quora page in the Wayback Machine’s index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-18224&quot; src=&quot;https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wayback_quora-1024x367.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; srcset=&quot;https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wayback_quora-1024x367.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wayback_quora-300x108.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wayback_quora-768x275.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wayback_quora-800x287.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quora could do literally nothing, and the Internet Archive would actively preserve the work of their millions of users for the future, but they’ve chosen to exclude their site from being archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/robots.txt&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; file, they elaborate on why they block the Wayback Machine, claiming they do it to protect their writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People share a lot of sensitive material on Quora – controversial political views, workplace gossip and compensation, and negative opinions held of companies. Over many years, as they change jobs or change their views, it is important that they can delete or anonymize their previously-written answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opt out of the wayback machine because inclusion would allow people to discover the identity of authors who had written sensitive answers publicly and later had made them anonymous, and because it would prevent authors from being able to remove their content from the internet if they change their mind about publishing it. As far as we can tell, there is no way for sites to selectively programmatically remove content from the archive and so this is the only way for us to protect writers. If they open up an API where we can remove content from the archive when authors remove it from Quora, but leave the rest of the content archived, we would be happy to opt back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive is a historical archive of the public internet, and Quora asking for the ability to selectively modify their archives is absurd. An API like they’re suggesting would be ripe for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive inadvertently acts as a contingency for every startup’s short-sighted business plan, disastrous pivots, or acquisitions gone awry. When you run a social platform with content generated by the community, you have a larger responsibility not to burn their collective work to the ground. Part of that responsibility is participating in the web, and giving back what you take from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Wayback Machine’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004716091-Wayback-Machine-General-Information&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the Internet Archive collecting sites from the Internet? What makes the information useful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage. Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form. The Archive’s mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library for researchers, historians, and scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quora’s closure isn’t a remote, distant possibility, and as a collection of uniquely personal stories and knowledge, there’s a strong argument for preserving it. Most VC-funded social platforms eventually shutter, and in many cases, the only remnants left are what was saved by volunteer archivists and the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Quora’s efforts to lock up its community’s contributions make it incredibly difficult to preserve when they go away, which they someday will. If you choose to contribute to Quora, they’re actively fighting to limit future access to your own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Burning It Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly ten years after its founding, Quora’s long-term prospects are still uncertain. They’ve raised over $225 million in four rounds of funding, most recently an $85 million Series D in April 2017 at a $1.7 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their self-serve ad platform launched last year, but have yet to report earnings. This is the first time in its nine-year history it’s made any money at all, which is better than nothing, but the sustainability of its model is still a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the investors who dumped a quarter billion dollars into it will want a return on that investment. Last year, founder Adam D’Angelo &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/quora-raises-85-million-to-expand-internationally-and-develop-its-ads-business/&quot;&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; they expect to eventually IPO. But market conditions, combined with the results of their ad platform, may force them in different directions — a pivot, merger, or acquisition are always a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Quora shuts down, and it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eventually shut down one day, all of that collected knowledge will be lost unless they change their isolationist ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, Adam D’Angelo &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.quora.com/Our-Mission&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “We hope to become an internet-scale Library of Alexandria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Quora keeps boarding up the exits, we may see it end the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-18225&quot; src=&quot;https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria-300x169.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria-768x432.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria-800x450.jpg 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alexandria.jpg 1480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why You Should Never, Ever Use Quora – Waxy.org</og:title>
<og:description>Forget about Quora's security breach. Their ongoing efforts to block access to their content, including a multi-year ban on the Internet Archive, are reason enough to never use them.</og:description>

<title>Why Aren’t Rich People Happy With the Money They Have?</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/rich-people-happy-money/577231/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/rich-people-happy-money/577231/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number of millionaires and billionaires in the world &lt;a href=&quot;http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=168E2808-9ED4-5A5E-19E43EA2A731A4ED&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;climbs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#6e77ac1b251c&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;ever higher&lt;/a&gt;, there are a growing number of people who possess more money than they could ever reasonably spend on even the lushest goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at a certain level of wealth, the next million isn’t going to suddenly revolutionize their lifestyle. What drives people, once they’ve reached that point, to keep pursuing more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some good explanations, I found, after talking to a few people who’ve spent significant amounts of time in the presence of and/or researching the really, really rich. Michael Norton, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied the connections between happiness and wealth, had a particularly elegant model for understanding this pattern of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton says that research &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53540&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001872675400700202&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to two central questions that people ask themselves when determining whether they’re satisfied with something in their life: &lt;em&gt;Am I doing better than I was before?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Am I doing better than other people?&lt;/em&gt; This applies to wealth, but also to attractiveness, height, and other things that people fret about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the problem is,” Norton says, “a lot of the things that really matter in life are hard to measure. So if you wanted to be a good parent, it’s a little hard to know if you’re being a better parent now than you were a year ago, and it’s also hard to know if you’re a better parent than the neighbors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So people turn to dimensions of comparison that can be quantified. “Money is a terrific one,” Norton says. “If I need to know if I’m doing better than I was, the easy thing to ask is, &lt;em&gt;Am I making more money?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Does my house have more square feet?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Do I have more houses than I used to?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This instinct to measure and compare doesn’t disappear once people have an obscene amount of money. “The problem is, &lt;em&gt;Am I doing better than I was?&lt;/em&gt; is only [moving people in] one direction, which is up,” Norton says. And if a family amasses, say, $50 million but upgrades to a neighborhood where everyone has that much money (or more), they feel a lot less rich than if they had stuck to the peer comparisons they were making tens of millions of dollars ago. Hence the ever-shifting goalposts of wealth and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research Norton has conducted illustrating this phenomenon is dispiriting. In &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53540&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;a paper published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, he and his collaborators asked more than 2,000 people who have a net worth of at least $1 million (including many whose wealth far exceeded that threshold) how happy they were on a scale of one to 10, and then how much more money they would need to get to 10. “All the way up the income-wealth spectrum,” Norton told me, “basically everyone says [they’d need] two or three times as much” to be perfectly happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did Norton find his rich people? For that particular study, an investment bank connected him with some of its high-net-worth clients. But Norton also told me that he had previously consulted with a pool of Dutch millionaires willing to respond to researchers’ questions, making themselves marginally richer in the process: For one study, Norton and his collaborator paid each respondent about 46 euros for every completed questionnaire. “You can run a survey on regular people for like a dollar,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Winters, a professor of political science at Northwestern University and the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780521182980&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;Oligarchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, said that in addition to social comparison, really rich people are often motivated to acquire more money by the thrill that comes with multiplying one’s fortune by making investments, buying up businesses, and so forth. “For those of us who make wages and have expenditures that we are trying to meet—a mortgage, pay our health insurance, food, whatever happens to be our kid’s tuition—we link the making of money to our expenses,” he says. Meanwhile, many ultra-wealthy people “use their money to make money,” he says—an exciting, status-enhancing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those two ways of putting money to use—as a way of covering expenses or as a way of building a bigger fortune—come with two different points of diminishing returns. “Say you wanted to have a mega-yacht plus six mansions in six different locations around the world,” Winters says. “You could probably do all of that fairly comfortably with a few hundred million dollars.” It’s different if the goal is to keep accumulating, in which case “there’s no number at which you have enough,” Winters says. He adds, “Every billionaire I’ve spoken to, and I’ve spoken to quite a number of them, is extremely excited by each additional increment of money they make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another expert I consulted, Brooke Harrington, a professor at the Copenhagen Business School who &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674743809&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;has studied and written about the financial practices of the super-wealthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, says that the question many rich people ask themselves about their money is not &lt;em&gt;Do I have enough to buy this expensive thing I want?&lt;/em&gt; but rather &lt;em&gt;Do I have as much or more than these people I’m comparing myself with?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sensation of ‘being well-off,’” she wrote to me in an email, “is not about fulfilling a childhood dream of buying a sailboat or something; feeling wealthy is about comparison with others in your reference group. So the question is not what individuals &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to buy, but what they feel they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; buy in order to keep up their status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novelist Gary Shteyngart also has firsthand experience seeing how rich people think about their wealth. The protagonist of his recent novel, &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246822/lake-success-by-gary-shteyngart/9780812997415/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;Lake Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, published a few months ago, is a New York financier, and in the course of researching the book, Shteyngart cultivated friendships with more than a dozen highly wealthy, mostly male hedge funders, the sorts of people who say they’re allergic to flying commercial and who hire chief financial officers to manage their family’s abundant wealth. “They’ve reached the point where you have all the money you ever really need for anything, and the things that they can buy are not that expensive compared to what they have,” he told me. “The gull-wing Tesla, the latest Tesla, I don’t know what it [costs], but it’s not that much if you have $100 million.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing Shteyngart noticed after spending time with this crowd was how competitive they were. “They’d compete against one another on their Bloomberg terminals all day and then at the end of the day they would play competitive poker with each other,” he says; this spirit of one-upmanship pervaded even the donations they made to charities. Shteyngart speculates that underneath this competitiveness is a need to seem smarter and more capable than their peers: Managers of hedge funds can sometimes get rich from making one or two bets that had more to do with luck than anything else, which might make them feel like their intelligence is in question even if their money stands as evidence of their professional success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shteyngart also witnessed the hedge funders making the sort of social comparisons that Norton and Harrington described, treating money as a “scorecard.” He remembers one of them saying something along the lines of “We don’t have best-seller lists and book awards. What we have is this—the number at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole experience did not leave Shteyngart feeling good. Here were people who could purchase anything they could ever want and whose wealth was widely envied, and even they weren’t content—just as these researchers studying happiness and wealth might have predicted. “At the end of the day,” Shteyngart told me, “I was just happy to end this research, because it was quite depressing.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Life of a Backpacker in Asia in the 1970s</title>

<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;colorissue&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Life of a Backpacker in Asia in the 1970s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story and photos by Kevin Kelly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an adapted excerpt from an interview on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rolfpotts.com/podcast/kevin-kelly/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Deviate podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Rolf Potts, a writer and speaker best known as a futurist talks about his early travel years in Asia, when backpacking meant cutting yourself off almost completely from the home you left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/photos/kelly-top.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Kelly traveling Asia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the 1960s in New Jersey was very parochial. Before I went traveling later, I had never eaten Chinese food in my life, I had never held chopsticks. But a friend of my father's was living in Japan and I would listen to his exotic stories when he visited and his life there seemed so interesting. But I never really dreamed of going. The only other window I really had into the world beyond was National Geographic magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became interested in photography in high school because I was kind of a science nerd. It seemed like a beautiful convergence of art and technology. At that time in the sixties the only way to do photography was to develop and print photos yourself, to go into the darkroom and mess with the chemicals. Photography was esoteric in the sense that there was a lot of information you had to master. Cameras were not automatic so you had to learn the system. I really got into photography in 1970 and spent a lot time in the darkroom then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first impetus to want to travel was reading Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass—an ode to the diversity of geography. After that I suddenly got this urge to travel, something I had never really had before. Then a friend of mine told me he was moving to Taiwan for a while and invited me to come visit him there. So then I concocted a plan to take photographs in Taiwan and Japan because my father's friend had a contact for me in Japan also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew nothing about Asia, or even travelling; I had never even been out of New England. I knew nothing about what to expect. I went to the bookstores and it was really hard to find any information. There were these Fodor's guidebooks for people who had a lot of money. I didn't have any money. They barely covered places like Taiwan, so these books weren't of any use to me. There was no internet, of course, and the libraries didn't have much. I travelled kind of blindly because I had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started getting this idea that maybe I should be a National Geographic photographer so I actually called up the National Geographic office and asked for the photo editor. I was about 18 years old. I had looked at the masthead and got a name, so I called up and asked to speak to him. The guy took my call, I told him about my going to Taiwan and Japan, and asked him if he needed any photos from there. He patiently said, &quot;Well, that's not really how it works. But show me what you've got when you get back and we'll see if any of it's worthwhile.&quot; (True to his word, he did take a look later, but I never got published there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/photos/kelly-taiwan.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Kelly Taiwan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back it's sort of remarkable. When I was in Taiwan I came across very few other travelers. Taiwan at that time had almost no English translation anywhere. This was in the early seventies and it was similar to China in that respect. It was like I had discovered a secret world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very frustrating for me as someone who didn't speak Chinese or read Chinese just finding hotels because to start with there just weren't many apart from business hotels. There were no signs I could read and so I was trying to learn this character for hotel, but sometimes it was more than one character. Often they didn't look like hotels, there was just something like a garage door on the street, and then often they often didn't take foreigners. So just finding a place to sleep was actually a big deal for me as I was trying traveling around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually while I was still in Taiwan, my first foreign country, I encountered these two Swiss guys who were traveling and they were describing their recent adventures going through Indonesia and India and I asked, &quot;Wait, you mean you can just go there? You just buy a ticket and go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they said, &quot;Yeah you just you just go there.&quot; Then of course I asked, &quot;Well...how do you get around? How do you know where to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said, &quot;You just go and ask around.&quot; Then they were raving about the Philippines, where they had just come from, because you could get by with English. &quot;It's just a couple hours away by flight and the fare is really cheap. You should go!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/photos/kelly-philippines.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Kelly Phillipines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I thought yes, I should go. I wanted to take a break from this struggle of trying to get around in Taiwan with the language barrier so I actually bought a ticket to the Philippines a week later. It was very cheap. When I got on the plane. I had nothing. I mean I had zero information. I had no guidebook, no contacts, no addresses. I didn't know anything about the country. I remember sitting there on the plane and there was a little map in the back of the seat and I thought to myself, &quot;Wow, there are a lot of islands down here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Manila at the airport and I didn't even know where to go. There were families meeting other people at the airport and one of them threw a little garland of flowers around me. I was asking them, &quot;Are there hotels here in Manila? Where should I go?&quot; I didn't have a single scrap of advance guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They told me to get a jeepney into the city and showed me how, so I took a jeepney from the airport and then I was walking around, seeing if I could find a hotel. I just would get a map and try to figure everything out. Well, there's a ferry here, let's see what time the ferries go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of information sounds almost unbelievable to us now but that really was the state of affairs at that time and the solution was just to ask. That's easier in a place where they speak English. Asking in places like Taiwan was frustrating, it was work. There was a little bit of anxiety every day. Will I be able to find a place? I was writing down characters, trying to translate signs. In India, Burma, places like that it was a lot easier, but in Japan it was a constant struggle to communicate and find things. Very little was in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/photos/kelly-japan.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Kelly Japan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard way to deal with money then was travelers checks. To cash them you had to go to a bank. Not just any bank, but a special bank, and those were usually in the biggest cities. It was always a big ritual, a lot of bureacracy, standing in different lines. That worked pretty well at the time. I would carry a few hundred dollars of cash at any given time and that continued through the 80s. You had to pace yourself with what you had and make sure you didn't run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was way before the internet, of course, and you couldn't make phone calls that weren't prohibitively expensive. So the way you stayed in touch was you sent aerograms. These were single thin sheets of paper that you folded up a certain way after you wrote on one side and you could send a letter to someone fairly cheaply. You would then collect mail by telling people ahead of time that you were going to Burma and they should send a letter to you post restante in Rangoon. Then in the main post office in Rangoon there would just be trays and trays of mail, these long trays, full of letters from abroad addressed to different people. There were hundreds, sometimes thousands of envelopes. Often they weren't in any order, so you just had to flip through them all to see if there was anything addressed to you. You could write a letter to anyone, anywhere in the world, and send it to post restante in that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan was very expensive, even then, so I hitchhiked through Japan and stayed in youth hostels. They offered an all-you-can-eat breakfast and dinner. Granted, hostel meals were white rice, miso soup, some pickles and maybe an egg, but that was enough to keep me going most of the time. Then I'd try to find a noodle shop I could afford now and then. I was living on three or four dollars a day in Japan. In India and Burma back then you could get by on a couple dollars a day. You could really go very, very far for a few thousand dollars if you were willing to live at a level where were you stayed was in a dorm with a shared bath and no shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up going to these communal places not because I wanted to hang out with other travelers necessarily, but because that dorm became the guidebook! Every place would have these guestbooks that guests would write in. People would post key information there. There was this very thin, rarified network of people who just came from an area. Now traveling the circuit is like a rite of passage in Southeast Asia especially, but then it was like this secret network of people who would leave breadcrumbs: which hotels would accept travelers, where you could find yogurt, where to find a bus in the northern Philippines. Because this was before Lonely Planet and Moon Handbooks, this is where you would get all your information, where you picked up all your tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/photos/kelly-japan2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Kelly Japan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't identify quite with that crowd though. They were really there to have a good time, cheaply, but I had given myself an assignment. I saw myself as a working photographer. I was documenting the rare stuff. I was out all day taking photos and exploring, traveling hard, always moving. I went to those traveler guesthouses because they were the sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>JIRA is an antipattern</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/09/jira-is-an-antipattern/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/09/jira-is-an-antipattern/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Atlassian’s JIRA began life as a bug-tracking tool. Today, though, it has become an agile planning suite, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/comparison/jira-vs-bugzilla&quot;&gt;to plan, track, and release great software&lt;/a&gt;.” In many organizations it has become the primary map of software projects, the hub of all development, the infamous “source of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a truism that the map is not the territory. Alas, this seems especially true of JIRA. Its genesis as a bug tracker, and its resulting use of “tickets” as its fundamental, defining unit, have made its maps especially difficult to follow. JIRA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is all too often used in a way which makes it, inadvertently, an industry-wide “antipattern,” i.e. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern&quot;&gt;a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that writing elegant software has in common with art: its crafters should remain cognizant of the overall macro vision of the project, at the same time they are working on its smallest micro details. JIRA, alas, implicitly teaches everyone to ignore the larger vision while focusing on details. There is no whole. At best there is an “Epic” — but the whole point of an Epic is to be decomposed into smaller pieces to be worked on independently. JIRA encourages the disintegration of the macro vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, feature-driven JIRA does not easily support the concept of project-wide infrastructure which does not map to individual features. A data model used across the project. A complex component used across multiple pages. A caching layer for a third-party interface. A background service providing real-time data used across multiple screens. Sure, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; wedge those into JIRA’s ticket paradigm … but the spiderweb of dependencies which result don’t help anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, though, is the endless implicit pressure for tickets to be &lt;em&gt;marked finished&lt;/em&gt;, to be passed on to the next phase. Tickets, in the JIRA mindset, are taken on, focused on until complete, and then passed on, never to be seen again. They have a one-way lifecycle: specification; design; development; testing; release. Doesn’t that sound a little … um … waterfall-y? Isn’t agile development supposed to be fundamentally &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from waterfall development, rather than simply replacing one big waterfall with a thousand little ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an analogy. Imagine a city-planning tool which makes it easy to design city maps which do include towers, residential districts, parks, malls, and roads … but which doesn’t easily support things like waterworks, sewers, subway tunnels, the electrical grid, etc., which can only be wedged in through awkward hacks, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine this tool is used as a blueprint for construction, with the implicit baked-in assumption that a) the neighborhood is the fundamental unit of city construction b) cities are built one neighborhood at a time, and neighborhoods one block at a time. What’s more, one is incentivized to proceed to the next only when the last is absolutely complete, right down to the flowers growing in the median strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; imagine that the city’s developers, engineers, and construction workers are asked to estimate and report progress purely in terms of how many neighborhoods and blocks have been fully completed, and how far along each one is. Does that strike you as a particularly effective model of urban planning? Do you think you would like to live in its result? Or, in practice, do you think that the best way to grow a city might be just a little more organic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s extend that metaphor. Suppose you began to build the city more organically, so that, at a certain significant point, you have a downtown full of a mix of temporary and permanent buildings; the skyscrapers’ foundations laid (i.e. technical uncertainty resolved); much of the core infrastructure built out; a few clusters of initial structures in the central neighborhoods, and shantytowns in the outskirts; a dirt airstrip where the airport will be; and traffic going back and forth among all these places. In other words, you have built a crude but functioning city-in-the-making, its skeleton constructed, ready to be fleshed out. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if measured by how many blocks and neighborhoods are absolutely &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;, according to the urban planners’ artistic renditions, what is your progress? By that measure, your progress is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is not how JIRA incentivizes you to work. That would look like a huge column of in-progress tickets, and zero complete ones. That would look beyond terrible. Instead JIRA incentivizes you to complete an entire block, and then the next; an entire neighborhood, and then the next; to kill off as many different tickets as possible, to mark them complete and pass them on, even if splicing them together after the fact is more difficult than building them to work together in the first place,.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you prefer a smaller-scale model, just transpose: city → condo building, neighborhood → floor, block → unit, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so people take tickets, implement them as written, pass them off to whoever is next in the workflow, consider their job well done, even if working on scattered groups of them in parallel might be much more effective … and without ever considering the larger goal. “Implement the Upload button” says the ticket; so that is all that is done. The ticket does not explain that the larger goal of the Upload button is to let users back up their work. Perhaps it would actually be technically easier to automatically upload every state change, such that the user gets automatic buttonless backups plus a complete undo/redo stack. But all the ticket says is: “Implement the Upload button.” So that is all that is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, the only time anyone worries about the vision of the project as a whole is at the very beginning, when the overworked project manager(s) initially deal(s) with the thankless task of decomposing the entire project into a forest of tickets. But the whole &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of agile development is to accept that the project will always be changing over time, and — albeit to a lesser extent — for multiple people, everyone on the team, to help contribute to that change. JIRA has become a tool which actually works against this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And don’t even get me started on asking engineers to estimate a project that someone else has broken down, into subcomponents whose partitioning feels unnatural, by giving them about thirty seconds per feature during a planning meeting, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; basing the entire project plan on those hand-waved un-researched off-the-top-of-the-head half-blind guesses, without ever revisiting them or providing time for more thoughtful analysis. That antipattern is not JIRA’s fault … exactly. But JIRA’s structure contributes to it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying JIRA has no place. It’s very good when you’re at the point where breaking things down into small pieces and finishing them sequentially does make sense. And, unsurprisingly given its history, it’s exceedingly good at issue tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate: to write elegant software, you must keep both the macro and the micro vision in your mind simultaneously while working. JIRA is good at managing micro pieces. But you need something else for the macro. (And no, a clickable prototype isn’t enough; those are important, but they too require descriptive context.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to propose something shocking and revolutionary: &lt;em&gt;prose&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, that’s right; words in a row; thoughtfully written paragraphs. I’m not talking about huge requirements documents. I’m talking about maybe a ten-page overview describing the vision for the entire project in detail, and a six-page architectural document explaining the software infrastructure — where the city’s water, sewage, power, subways, and airports are located, and how they work, to extend the metaphor. When Amazon can, famously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/bezos-admits-amazon-has-the-weirdest-meeting-culture-2018-4&quot;&gt;require six-page memos in order to call meetings&lt;/a&gt;, this really doesn’t seem like too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply ceasing to treat JIRA as the primary map and model of project completion undercuts a great deal of its implicit antipatternness. Use it for tracking iterative development and bug fixes, by all means. It’s very good at that. But it is a tool deeply ill-suited to be the map of a project’s overall vision or infrastructure, and it is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; the source of truth — the source of truth is always the running code. In software, as in art, the micro work and the macro vision should always be informed by one another. Let JIRA map the micro work; but let good old-fashioned plain language describe the macro vision, and try to pay more attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Atlassian seems to have decapitalized JIRA between versions &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver079/administering-jira-server-7-9-applications-950288070.html&quot;&gt;7.9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver0710/administering-jira-server-7-10-applications-953144166.html&quot;&gt;7.10&lt;/a&gt;, but descriptively, all-caps still seems more common.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Do I really need to get out the soldering-iron again?</title>
<link>http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had this idea that it would be nice to listen to music when I get home from work everyday, so I put all my ripped music onto my phone, and I bought some good quality over-ear headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/new_headphones.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;new headphones&quot; width=&quot;1446&quot; height=&quot;810&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found I liked the great sound quality of the headphones, and the way they block atmospheric noise out a bit so I can just hear the music. It's a great experience to listen to some great music for 20 minutes when I get home to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I had a problem. When my phone plays certain tracks it makes and explosion of noise when switching songs, or pausing and resuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried converting the music to different formats (flac, wav and vorbis), it didn't help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried a different music-player app, it didn't help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried a different Android phone, it didn't help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/code_culprit.png&quot; alt=&quot;section of code from Android music-player app&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that all music players on Android actually play music using the Android-media-player-service. Apparently this service has some sort of bug. Maybe it doesn't like the metadata in those tracks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd actually noticed this problem before, but these new headphones make it much more of a problem because they're much more sensitive, so the sound explosion is extremely loud relative to the music, scaring the hell out of me. This is not OK because the whole point is for me to be relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Android is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt;, meaning I can modify the code, it would probably take me months to learn enough about music decoding and the Android-media-player-service to write a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my first idea was to just get one of those portable CD players. So I bought a medium priced one from Argos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/cd_player.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;black portable CD player&quot; width=&quot;1584&quot; height=&quot;932&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this device has a problem too; it constantly feeds a hissing sound into the headphones. Like the phone's explosion problem, it's made worse by the sensitivity of the headphones, as the hiss has a constant amplitude, which is unaffected by the volume control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I'm kind-of surprised at how hard it is to just listen to music with headphones. I'm sure I didn't have such bad problems doing this 15 years ago with a cheap MP3 player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desktop has great sound quality but I don't want to be sitting at my computer chair while I listen to my music, I do that too much already. So I thought why don't I use my spare old laptop as a music-player?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/spare_laptop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;white netbook&quot; width=&quot;1518&quot; height=&quot;1018&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I put a fresh install of Debian and installed mpd and ncmpc. It works and frankly ncmpc has a much nicer interface than any android music player apps I've tried, or a CD player. But the sound quality on the laptop is just not quite up-to scratch. I think the output buffer on the amplifier is just not very good and struggles with the dynamic load of the transducers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm absolutely astonished at how difficult it appears to be to just listen to music with a good pair of headphones. Is it not 2018? The media is full of talk about preposterously ambitious ideas such as AI and self-driving cars and yet I can't even listen to a fuck-damn music track? O_o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done my best to avoid this ... but it looks like I'm gonna have to solve this problem with A FUCKING SOLDERING IRON!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the circuit is this fucking simple OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/schematic_20181028.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;circuit diagram&quot; width=&quot;1289&quot; height=&quot;867&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK so now I made it with parts I had lying around and it's fucking primitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/madeit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;unenclosed circuit board, plugged into the CD player, my headphones and a battery.&quot; width=&quot;1470&quot; height=&quot;934&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works completely great! I plug it into my laptop or CD player and it sorts out the sound quality and gets rid of all the hiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds fab, what else can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to point out that you could have built this in the 70s. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne5532.pdf&quot;&gt;NE5532P&lt;/a&gt; op-amps I'm using were first made and sold in 1979. Interesting how a 1979-technology audio buffer can best a 2010 laptop or a 2018 CD-player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I need to make a case and find a more sensible way to power it but right now I'm just glad I've got something that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone reads this post I'm sure loads of people will tell me that my problems are all my own making and if only I invested in an iPhone all my problems would go away. Well you know what? APPLE IS A SYMBOL OF PRETENTIOUSNESS AND IGNORANCE - YOU DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW YOUR PHONE WORKS - I DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A TAX TO APPLE TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More about the circuit I made&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this article is technical notes on how the circuit works for anyone who's interested or wants to make one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This circuit is a buffer and it helps by two mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It improves sound quality by taking away the hard work of driving the dynamic load of the headphones from the device. It can do this job well because op-amps work great when they have lots of voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a gain of 0.1, which means it makes the source quieter. This helps with the problems I've had because these headphones are very sensitive and my devices do not like driving them at the low amplitudes they require.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make this but don't want the quietening effect, I think it should be fine to just remove the four 10K resistors. This gives you a gain of 1, which means the voltage levels are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted best possible sound you'd use some actual audio op-amps rather than these cheap NE5532P. And buffer the output of the op-amps somehow. But of-course size and cost balloons if you start adding buffers and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more info on headphone amps check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://tangentsoft.net/&quot;&gt;Tangentsoft&lt;/a&gt; (And you thought the 90s web was dead)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes on performance:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have an oscilloscope so I can't do any proper signal analysis on the circuit but frankly if it sounds good; it is good as far as I'm concerned. And as I said it sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic DC-offset is unmeasurable with my equipment (0.0mV according to my voltmeter). Furthermore it divides the DC offset of the source by 10! There is however a small pop when it switches on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pictures of construction:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the components before assembly. The headphone jacks are scavenged from an old computer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/components.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1467&quot; height=&quot;883&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arranged all the parts with the prototyping board balanced on a tray. The annoying thing about doing it this way is that you then have to turn it over to solder it, and the parts start falling out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/assembly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1504&quot; height=&quot;941&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding it on it's side with a handy-andy I was able to get it all soldered up without too many things falling out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/underside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;890&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This circuit was easy to make; I didn't even bother to prototype it and yet it worked first time. Though note I have made audio amps before so I knew what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/using.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1902&quot; height=&quot;1418&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to finish this off with a proper case and power-supply so it's not a pain-in-the arse to use. Shame Maplin closed because now I have to order parts off the internet and WAIT. I'm beginning to notice a trend in the world-order whereby the shinier Apple's iPhones get the worse everything else gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure one-day everyone will get their music injected direct from their iPhone to their brain by a needle. And anyone who tries to listen to music with their ears will be burned as a heretic for betraying &quot;the Gods&quot; (Apple, Spotify and other tech deities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update: Finishing it off!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did eventually finish it off with a proper enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/low.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1308&quot; height=&quot;757&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that it can be repaired if necessary, I gave it a magnetically attached lid. By putting the two pairs of magnets different ways, I was able to make it repel of you try to put the lid on wrong. Quite cool :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/inside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2016&quot; height=&quot;928&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit is held-in by screws and is connected to the power-supply through a mini terminal block so it can be removed for maintenance, or even replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it requires &amp;gt;10V, I had to use two PP3 batteries to power it. These battery holders are quite nice, just draws that slide out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/batt_slide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;634&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery life is only a few hours unfortunately because the circuit draws an enormous idle current of 23mA :o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've put some nice &quot;Bumpon&quot; rubber feet on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/bottom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;959&quot; height=&quot;620&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I designed a clever little circuit to drive the indicator LED. I wanted an indication of battery level. This is the schematic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/indicator.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;537&quot; height=&quot;349&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this does is, when the amp is turned on, lights up for a moment, then turns off and stays off. But the amount of time which it comes on for depends on battery level. If battery is good, it lights up of only a fraction of a second. But as the battery gets low, it stays on for longer and longer. If battery level is unacceptable it lights up forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/finished.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1918&quot; height=&quot;1122&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 10, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Engine Black Book DOOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/gebb.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; /&gt; The Game Engine Black Book: DOOM is now available for purchase. It is being released exactly 25 years after DOOM.zip was first published on the University of Wisconsin FTP server in December 1993. You can get it at the following locations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Amazon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1987418433/&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1987418433/&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1987418433/&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1987418433/&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and many more).&lt;br /&gt;- Google Books (&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Fabien_Sanglard_Game_Engine_Black_Book_DOOM?id=wel6DwAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with no DRM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From November 2017 to November 2018, it took one year to complete. Both John Carmack and Dave Taylor kindly wrote forewords. The result is 427 pages, full color, to describe in great detail the PCs of the era (Intel 80486, VESA Local BUS, Dos Extenders, Watcom Compiler, ...), the NeXT hardware (and especially the NeXTStation TurboColor), the engine, and the console ports to the Jaguar, Sega 32X, Super Nintendo, Sony Playstation, 3DO, and Sega Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish the paper version could have been priced lower. A black and white version would have been cheaper ($39.00) but given the many screenshots and drawings, readability would have suffered. I tried to look around but all printers gave me roughly the same price for a 400+ pages full color book. If anybody has an idea to lower the price I will listen carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Errata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;paperbox&quot;&gt;If you find any errors, please report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxreTT5nPl6taxf3dFyCe9QLm8HmE29BA9a4KgnGKVE/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Game Engine Black Book: DOOM errata sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;paperbox&quot;&gt;I was transparent about the Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D's &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; and I want to do the same for DOOM's Black Book. Here are all the numbers. When I upload the PDF on Amazon, a minimal price is automatically calculated. In the case of the DOOM, Amazon sets the minimal price at $51.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a slider which authors can use in order to add their &quot;share&quot; on top of Amazon price. I have added $3.88 which Amazon also takes a cut on. The result is $1.59 royalty and $0.77 profit per book sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/stats.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ReactDOM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'container'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, React re-renders the component with the next &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{ clicked: true }&lt;/code&gt; state and updates the DOM to match the returned &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Thanks&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems straightforward. But wait, does &lt;em&gt;React&lt;/em&gt; do it? Or &lt;em&gt;React DOM&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating the DOM sounds like something React DOM be responsible for. But we’re calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt;, not something from React DOM. And our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; base class is defined inside React itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; update the DOM?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/why-do-react-elements-have-typeof-property/&quot;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/why-do-we-write-super-props/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, you don’t actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know any of that to be productive with React. This post is for those who like to see what’s behind the curtain. Completely optional!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might think that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; class contains DOM update logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that were the case, how can &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt; work in other environments? For example, components in React Native apps also extend &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt;. They call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt; just like we did above, and yet React Native works with Android and iOS native views instead of the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also be familiar with React Test Renderer or Shallow Renderer. Both of these testing strategies let you render normal components and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt; inside them. But neither of them works with the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used renderers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-art&quot;&gt;React ART&lt;/a&gt;, you might also know that it’s possible to use more than one renderer on the page. (For example, ART components work inside a React DOM tree.) This makes a global flag or variable untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So somehow &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; delegates handling state updates to the platform-specific code.&lt;/strong&gt; Before we can understand how this happens, let’s dig deeper into how packages are separated and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a common misconception that the React “engine” lives inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package. This is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, ever since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/07/03/react-v0.14-beta-1.html#two-packages&quot;&gt;package split in React 0.14&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package intentionally only exposes APIs for &lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt; components. Most of the &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt; of React lives in the “renderers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom/server&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-test-renderer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-art&lt;/code&gt; are some examples of renderers (and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/README.md#practical-examples&quot;&gt;build your own&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package is useful regardless of which platform you target. All its exports, such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Children&lt;/code&gt; utilities and (eventually) &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html&quot;&gt;Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, are independent of the target platform. Whether you run React DOM, React DOM Server, or React Native, your components would import and use them in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the renderer packages expose platform-specific APIs like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ReactDOM.render()&lt;/code&gt; that let you mount a React hierarchy into a DOM node. Each renderer provides an API like this. Ideally, most &lt;em&gt;components&lt;/em&gt; shouldn’t need to import anything from a renderer. This keeps them more portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What most people imagine as the React “engine” is inside each individual renderer.&lt;/strong&gt; Many renderers include a copy of the same code — we call it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler&quot;&gt;“reconciler”&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/15/improving-the-repository-infrastructure.html#migrating-to-google-closure-compiler&quot;&gt;build step&lt;/a&gt; smooshes the reconciler code together with the renderer code into a single highly optimized bundle for better performance. (Copying code is usually not great for bundle size but the vast majority of React users only needs one renderer at a time, such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package only lets you &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; React features but doesn’t know anything about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they’re implemented. The renderer packages (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt;, etc) provide the implementation of React features and platform-specific logic. Some of that code is shared (“reconciler”) but that’s an implementation detail of individual renderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know why &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; packages need to be updated for new features. For example, when React 16.3 added the Context API, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.createContext()&lt;/code&gt; was exposed on the React package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.createContext()&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t actually &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; the context feature. The implementation would need to be different between React DOM and React DOM Server, for example. So &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createContext()&lt;/code&gt; returns a few plain objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;defaultValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; context &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    _currentValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; defaultValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    Provider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    Consumer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Provider &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    $$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Symbol&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'react.provider'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    _context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; context
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Consumer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    $$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Symbol&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'react.context'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    _context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MyContext.Provider&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MyContext.Consumer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the code, it’s the &lt;em&gt;renderer&lt;/em&gt; that decides how to handle them. React DOM might track context values in one way, but React DOM Server might do it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if you update &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; to 16.3+ but don’t update &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;, you’d be using a renderer that isn’t yet aware of the special &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Provider&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why an older &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; would &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/49677020/458193&quot;&gt;fail saying these types are invalid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same caveat applies to React Native. However, unlike React DOM, a React release doesn’t immediately “force” a React Native release. They have an independent release schedule. The updated renderer code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits/master/Libraries/Renderer/oss&quot;&gt;separately synced&lt;/a&gt; into the React Native repository once in a few weeks. This is why features become available in React Native on a different schedule than in React DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now we know that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package doesn’t contain anything interesting, and the implementation lives in renderers like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. But that doesn’t answer our question. How does &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; “talk” to the right renderer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer is that every renderer sets a special field on the created class.&lt;/strong&gt; This field is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;updater&lt;/code&gt;. It’s not something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would set — rather, it’s something React DOM, React DOM Server or React Native set right after creating an instance of your class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; inst &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;YourComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updater &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ReactDOMUpdater&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; inst &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;YourComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updater &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ReactDOMServerUpdater&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; inst &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;YourComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;inst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updater &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ReactNativeUpdater&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react/src/ReactBaseClasses.js#L58-L67&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; implementation in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all it does is delegate work to the renderer that created this component instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;partialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; callback&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updater&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;enqueueSetState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; partialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; callback&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React DOM Server &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRenderer.js#L442-L448&quot;&gt;might want to&lt;/a&gt; ignore a state update and warn you, whereas React DOM and React Native would let their copies of the reconciler &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassComponent.js#L190-L207&quot;&gt;handle it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt; can update the DOM even though it’s defined in the React package. It reads &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.updater&lt;/code&gt; which was set by React DOM, and lets React DOM schedule and handle the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know about classes now, but what about Hooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people first look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html&quot;&gt;Hooks proposal API&lt;/a&gt;, they often wonder: how does &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; “know what to do”? The assumption is that it’s more “magical” than a base &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; class with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we have seen today, the base class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt; implementation has been an illusion all along. It doesn’t do anything except forwarding the call to the current renderer. And &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; Hook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js#L55-L56&quot;&gt;does exactly the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;updater&lt;/code&gt; field, Hooks use a “dispatcher” object.&lt;/strong&gt; When you call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.useState()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.useEffect()&lt;/code&gt;, or another built-in Hook, these calls are forwarded to the current dispatcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
  __currentDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;initialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__currentDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;initialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;initialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__currentDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;initialState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And individual renderers set the dispatcher before rendering your component:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; prevDispatcher &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__currentDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__currentDispatcher &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ReactDOMDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;YourComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__currentDispatcher &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; prevDispatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the React DOM Server implementation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRendererHooks.js#L340-L354&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the reconciler implementation shared by React DOM and React Native is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why a renderer such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; needs to access the same &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; package that you call Hooks from. Otherwise, your component won’t “see” the dispatcher! This may not work when you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991&quot;&gt;multiple copies of React&lt;/a&gt; in the same component tree. However, this has always led to obscure bugs so Hooks force you to solve the package duplication before it costs you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don’t encourage this, you can technically override the dispatcher yourself for advanced tooling use cases. (I lied about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;__currentDispatcher&lt;/code&gt; name but you can find the real one in the React repo.) For example, React DevTools will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L203-L214&quot;&gt;a special purpose-built dispatcher&lt;/a&gt; to introspect the Hooks tree by capturing JavaScript stack traces. &lt;em&gt;Don’t repeat this at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means Hooks aren’t inherently tied to React. If in the future more libraries want to reuse the same primitive Hooks, in theory the dispatcher could move to a separate package and be exposed as a first-class API with a less “scary” name. In practice, we’d prefer to avoid premature abstraction until there is a need for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;updater&lt;/code&gt; field and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;__currentDispatcher&lt;/code&gt; object are forms of a generic programming principle called &lt;em&gt;dependency injection&lt;/em&gt;. In both cases, the renderers “inject” implementations of features like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; into the generic React package to keep your components more declarative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to think about how this works when you use React. We’d like React users to spend more time thinking about their application code than abstract concepts like dependency injection. But if you’ve ever wondered how &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; know what to do, I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;
