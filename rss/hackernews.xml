<title>The Atlantic lays off almost 20% of staff</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/the-atlantic-layoffs-coronavirus-49cc6ad2-6579-45cd-b816-e20865f7351e.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/the-atlantic-layoffs-coronavirus-49cc6ad2-6579-45cd-b816-e20865f7351e.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic is laying off nearly 20% of staff, according to an internal note from David Bradley, the publication's chairman, that was obtained by Axios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; It's the latest media company that's been been forced to take drastic measures to survive the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The state of play:&lt;/strong&gt; The 68 staff cuts are mostly attributable to the collapse of the company's events business, which was one of its strongest pillars for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the memo, Bradley says that sales, editorial and events staff are all impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;There is no fault on the part of people leaving the firm.  What makes this so particularly difficult is that these are exceptional and beloved Atlantic colleagues.  They are exactly the same good people who were selected to join us at the outset.  Measure for measure, they have contributed to The Atlantic as have those who are remaining. It is only that the ground has shifted,&quot; Bradley wrote in his note to staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I had thought that I would spend some substantial part of this memo explaining the reasoning behind our decision. But, I think it may speak for itself. The particular timing is clear — a global pandemic that has shuttered the economy generally, advertising acutely, and in-person events altogether,&quot; he added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; The Atlantic's new majority ownership stake from Emerson Collective, the impact investment vehicle owned by Laurene Powell Jobs, has allowed the company to accelerate its growth in recent years, including &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;a major staff increase and expansion that began in 2018&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/the-atlantic-to-expand-adds-100-people-300e3a96-375e-44f0-b10f-2a7e6da5152b.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;49cc6ad2-6579-45cd-b816-e20865f7351e&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;The Atlantic lays off almost 20% of staff&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/the-atlantic-to-expand-adds-100-people-300e3a96-375e-44f0-b10f-2a7e6da5152b.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;a major staff increase and expansion that began in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The pandemic is forcing dozens of &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;major media companies,&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-news-media-advertising-layoffs-3bdc8547-4977-4338-a6af-e53fb14d64cd.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;49cc6ad2-6579-45cd-b816-e20865f7351e&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;The Atlantic lays off almost 20% of staff&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-news-media-advertising-layoffs-3bdc8547-4977-4338-a6af-e53fb14d64cd.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;major media companies,&lt;/a&gt; including newer, digitally-native media companies and older magazine companies, to carry out layoffs and pay cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Atlantic joins The Hollywood Reporter, Fortune, Billboard, The Economist Group, Group Nine Media, BuzzFeed News, Vox Media, Bustle Digital Group, Cheddar, Maven Media, G/O Media, Protocol and others who have resorted to layoffs and furloughs.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>An Amazon programmer’s perspective (2015)</title>
<link>https://pastebin.com/BjD84BQ3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pastebin.com/BjD84BQ3</guid>
<description>&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigger warning: mention of suicidal ideation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I burned out as a developer at Amazon at the end of my second year. I’ve since found a healthy and sustainable work-life balance and enjoy work again. I write this to A) raise awareness, especially for new-hires and their families, and B) help give hope and advice to people going through the same at Amazon or other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Hello, world====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been no shortage of anecdotes, opinions, and rebuttals regarding Amazon’s corporate culture as of late. I write this not to capitalize on the latest news-feed fad, but to share what I had already written and promptly deleted. I didn’t think anyone would want to hear my story, but it’s apparent people are going through a similar experience and don’t have a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon; SDE II basically means a software developer with at least 2–3 years of industry experience. I started at Amazon as an SDE I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work at one of the Big 5 is no uncommon dream for most devs, but it was one that I shared. After passing a timed online coding quiz, I was flown to Seattle for an interview. Within a week of flying back, I got a call to congratulate me as well as discuss the usual (compensation, and benefits), as well as the exceptional (moving bonus, signing bonus, and vesting stock options). Remember those “exceptional” bits, as they matter later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first few months, things were fairly standard: typical corporate mottos (this time called “Principles”) and “your work is more than just work” speeches. I see through it now but at the time phrases like “World’s Most Customer-Centric Company” are candy to a wide-eyed new-hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====First Comes the Pager====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being on the team for a couple of months, I was put on the on-call rotation. Here’s what being on-call means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- You are on-call for 1 week every X weeks, where X is the number of members on your team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- While on-call, your other projects take up at most half your time during the workday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The rest of the workday is focused on operational issues (keeping the lights on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- You are on 24/7 pager duty during your on-call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what pager duty means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- You are paged if a “thing” your team owns goes “into alarm.” This is intentionally vague because it means different things for different teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- If paged, you have 15 minutes to get online and respond to the page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- If you don’t, your manager is paged. You do NOT want this to happen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-call wasn’t (and isn’t) too terrible for my team. At first we averaged 1 page every 2 weeks; now we’re up to about 1 a week. Other teams have it much, much worse. It is a social damper though. If you have to be able to “bail out” at a second’s notice, you can’t really make plans to go out anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention on-call duty because it is “peculiar” in that the only other profession requiring this kind of responsiveness is doctors, literal lifesavers. When you go on-call for the first time, it’s terrifying and tells you “holy crap, this is serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hiring process, on-call is not mentioned in any way other than the usual salaried catch-all &quot;are you willing to work nights and/or weekends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Then Come Loaners====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally in order to complete a large project, some other team may need to make code changes. That other team, naturally, may not be able to spare the developers required, so you get loaned out. Until the project is done, you're between teams and serving two managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, that other team thought they could spare the dev-hours and complete the code changes. When they don’t, at some point they fall behind, so you get loaned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's read &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; has their ears perking up. For those who haven't read it, here's the gist, via Wikipedia: &quot;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worst days at Amazon have been when I was loaned out; in fact, the worst days of my life were when I was loaned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of my second year at Amazon, I was pulled into &quot;Project X&quot; (obviously renamed). It had all the underpinnings of a project with a bad future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- changing requirements from different teams, in different countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- high stakes and visibility (practically up to Bezos himself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't give a day-by-day account, but to cut to the chase: things got intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the project fell behind, the pressure and scrutiny from above grew. The project managers wanted to pass down the urgency in the most productive way possible, to moderate success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long weekdays turned into working over the weekend. I felt largely responsible for how behind things were. As of now, I have no idea how true that is. Whatever the cause, whether through the need to prove my worth or out of fear of failure, the result was the same: I worked non-stop. Every waking hour was put into write code and fixing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I still had some self-awareness. I knew objectively that working more only makes one less productive, but It Had To Be Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhaustion eventually took over. My code got worse and worse. I thought I could outrace my bug-count with lines of code. The Inner Loop of the Death Spiral had begun to spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the stress changed my personality in ways that became visible to others. I was rude, when I’m normally out-going and understanding. I was humorless when I’m usually the one who makes jokes. My co-workers starting noticing it, despite the guise I tried to put on. I started choosing work over being with my friends. At first they understood. Some amount of &quot;sorry I need to work&quot; is understandable. Eventually they started to worry too. Again, in a misguided attempt to not burden them, I began to isolate myself =&amp;gt; The Second Loop of the Death Spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Lock-in====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't yet reached the outermost loop, but first, a short aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I mentioned Amazon's moving and signing bonus? Little caveat on that, if you leave or are fired within 2 years, you have to pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still fresh out of college, my savings were significantly less than how much I would've owed. So if I were to quit Amazon, I wouldn't just be out of a job, I would be in the hole more than three months' income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I cannot &quot;just leave.&quot; With that realization came paralyzing hopelessness. If I failed and got fired, then I may not be able to find another job for quite a while. Un/Underemployment among Millennials is kind of A Thing. Now I have the stress of staying employed on top of everything =&amp;gt; The Third Loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Cascading Failure====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, my self-care was non-existent. All to maximize code output, I lived off a steady stream of junk food and caffeine. I've always had some level of insomnia, but it got much worse. The final straw was when I traded sleep for code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the stress became a massive black hole in my mind. No other analogy fits. It physically felt crushing. No emotions and no thoughts could escape. I could only go over and over how much it hurt and that I wanted it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state is what I think of when I hear &quot;Amazombie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I cried. A lot. Usually when going to sleep, as I knew it would just all start again the next day. Sometimes with my wife. A couple of times in the bathroom stall. But no, (you masochists) not at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my brain producing only two thought types (&quot;Pain&quot; and &quot;Please stop pain&quot;), it wasn't long before thoughts of suicide crept in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear: I never took any action on these thoughts. I did not want to kill myself. I kept thoughts of planning away as much as I could. But that's the thing with suicidal ideation: despite what you really want, the thought comes back again and again and finally replaces &quot;Please stop pain&quot; with &quot;Please stop Everything.&quot; =&amp;gt; The Final Loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Endgame====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally sought psychiatric help. I remember the decision coming so matter-of-fact. Almost with the enthusiasm that you hire a handyman to fix something. &quot;Hm. A leaky pipe. Better get a plumber.&quot; &quot;Ruminating thoughts of ending it? I should have someone to look at that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, the only person who knew what was really going on was my wife. I cannot (but will try to) express my gratitude to her during this time. She was there exactly when I needed her. She helped even when she didn't understand why I was putting myself through it. She saw the signs much sooner than I did and tried to tell me. When I did realize I needed help, she put me in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was put on Celexa. Eventually the Death Spiral's loops unwound. The project launched. Things went back to mostly normal. I went off of Celexa after a couple of months. I didn't feel fully recovered until months later. I felt on eggshells. I rigorously prioritized self-care by leaving work at 8 hours in, on the dot. I started reaching back out to my friends for hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My manager gave me a couple of extra vacation days in return for my efforts. I was promoted to SDE II and was even healthy enough to celebrate and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Have Backbone====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what? So you burned yourself out and got burned out. What did you expect?&quot; I wrote this because I needed to put my story down and as a cautionary tale. I am NOT here to set some silly bar of what a &quot;real&quot; programmer does to get things done. I am NOT here to demonize Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as what I have to say to Amazon/Jeff Bezos, I only have a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Revisit your bonus/relocation payback strategy. I don't know what the &quot;right&quot; solution is, but if that's what you need to keep employees, that's fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Be upfront and as precise as possible with what a position entails. &quot;Working alongside smart and passionate people&quot; is lazy hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Encourage employees to be critical not just of ideas, but also of expectations. Getting them to buy into the idea that they have to give up everything else to get validation from you is abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Realize that productivity and happy employees is not a zero-sum game. The customer is not a wrathful god that demands a sacrifice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cautionary tale is not Amazon-specific. This could happen to nearly anyone, but especially people working in intense workplaces and especially developers working in intense workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a saying that I saw over and over again in forums and subreddits, but never believed until I lived it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It's your professional obligation to push back on unreasonable expectations. Your bosses may not like it at first, but they will respect you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other piece of advice-you-didn't-come-here-for: save some Fuck You money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Common Reactions====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that by posting this anonymously I'm not facilitating a discussion. An anon post is me talking at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wouldn't be posting in this manner if I wasn't authentically afraid of losing my job. The only other voices we've heard from current employees have been gag-worthy in favor of Amazon: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amazonians-response-inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-nick-ciubotariu, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-name-brittan-im-amazonian-brittan-cole-ma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few major criticisms of these two articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- They're on LinkedIn. I abhor anything posted on LinkedIn. All criticism is toothless; all words watered down. Because everything is scoured by future employers, everyone is afraid of actually saying anything controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- They're from employees that aren't &quot;on the ground,&quot; but rather a manager-of-managers and an HR-rep respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does no one else find it interesting that we're not seeing any negative criticism from current employees? I don't care what company you work for, there is never any shortage of people willing to complain. So why no negative articles from current employees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear. Fear breeds a culture of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few common responses I've seen to articles and I would like to pre-empt those here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Working more than exactly 40 hours is part of being a professional.&quot; (and variants thereof)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly, but these should be occasional events. 70+ hour weeks shouldn't be the holding pattern. They should be appreciated by management. Hell, buy us dinner if you're going to fuck us over a door desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why didn't you just work less? It seems like a lot of it was your own fault.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go over this question again and again in my own head. Along with the reasons mentioned before, I just felt compelled to push through it. I felt that after getting hired at such a &quot;big name&quot; company, that if I didn't put everything I could into it that I was doing a disservice to all those who helped me get here. What I didn't realize was that the opposite was true: that by breaking myself, I did show that I wasn't ready in a way. Thankfully I did make it through as was able to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're just a ball of negativity, no wonder you got depressed&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my next section...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Happy Trails====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my story, I do want to enumerate the things I enjoy about working at Amazon. I am still working here after all and I have no plans of putting in my notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Lax working hours &amp;amp; can work from home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?!? After all you just said?!?” But seriously, when things are not in crisis, which is 80%+ of the time, a developer's day rarely starts before 9am. You can usually work from home about once a week. If you need to leave work early for a good reason, that's fine (though it's usually common courtesy to work from home afterward).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- No Dress Code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be a given in most places, but coming from a business-casual-only place, t-shirts are a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be mentioned. I won’t give out numbers, as that could be identifying, but Glassdoor.com can satisfy your curiosity. When a good portion of my friends struggle to stay gainfully employed, it is nice. Despite the issues I described  above, I still come from a privileged position of being financially stable and now have a good amount of job security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Work with and build on top of &quot;giants&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the common hiring catch phrases of tech companies is to &quot;work alongside smart people.&quot; While I usually roll my eyes at that, it actually is important to a developer's growth to not always be the smartest one in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Recruiting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos's email mentioned how we get contacted by recruiters all the time; with that aspect was in touch with our reality. I've heard from Google, Facebook, Netflix, and others. I got more recruiting emails in my first month in Seattle than I did in a year in my previous location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Near-Instant Gratification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something great about having code you wrote be actually executed by thousands of people every day. So few people get to show their friends and family a site they visit often and say &quot;I did that thing there.&quot; Maybe it will wear off eventually, but it's still my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====Event Horizon====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li1&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on a new loaner project now. Another &quot;DEFCON ZEROMG!&quot; project, but now I have boundaries,and the knowledge that Amazon will not topple over if I don’t work 70-hour weeks. Work-life balance can be largely subjective, but I now know what that balance looks like for me and enforce that while still putting my best efforts into my work I had to learn that the hard way. I can only hope you don't have to as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt; Mark Zuckerberg is shifting Facebook Inc. toward a substantially remote workforce over the next decade, permanently reconfiguring the tech giant’s operations around the dispersed structure that the coronavirus pandemic forced on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan, which the Facebook chief executive laid out in detail to employees in livestreamed remarks on Thursday, is one of the highest-profile examples of business leaders committing to extend the practices their companies quickly embraced to adjust to the crisis.

<title>Dolphins at popular spot miss tourists and keep leaving &amp;#039;gifts&amp;#039; on shore</title>
<link>https://7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;A pod of dolphins in Queensland has been bringing ashore gifts from the sea - apparently because they’re missing interaction with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;The humpback dolphins usually mingle with visitors at Barnacles Cafe &amp;amp; Dolphin Feeding at Tin Can Bay, north of the Sunshine Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;But it’s been weeks since visitors lined up to feed the animals due to coronavirus restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;Among the treasures the marine creatures have provided are sea sponges, barnacle-encrusted bottles and pieces of coral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-1049565/1f411e671e7ae50b89fa47577e41f045d22aa276-16x9-x0y240w2016h1134.jpg?imwidth=650&amp;amp;impolicy=sevennews_v2&quot; alt=&quot;Some of the items brought ashore by dolphins at Tin Can Bay.&quot; class=&quot;css-12cetpi-StyledImage e9fo5th0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1vhm7mh-StyledFigCaptionText elinl0r4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1vt5x9l-Caption elinl0r3&quot;&gt;Some of the items brought ashore by dolphins at Tin Can Bay.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Credit: Bev Lambert/Barnacles Cafe &amp;amp; Dolphin Feeding&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“The pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they’re missing the public interaction and attention,” said a post on the cafe’s Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“They are definitely missing you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;A volunteer told the ABC while the pod has displayed the behaviour before, it had increased while the venue was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on 7NEWS.com.au&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;Barry McGovern, an expert in dolphin behaviour, said it was possible the dolphins were giving gifts because they missed humans, but unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“Nothing surprises me with dolphins and their behaviour anymore,” McGovern, a UQ PhD student, told 7NEWS.com.au.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“They do everything - they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“In all likelihood, they probably don’t miss humans per se. They probably miss a free meal and the routine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-1049565/98a8f9ecabc8c77dad45d3451fa953ab0c60648e-16x9-x0y420w2848h1602.jpg?imwidth=650&amp;amp;impolicy=sevennews_v2&quot; alt=&quot;File image of a tourist feeding the dolphins at Tin Can Bay.&quot; class=&quot;css-12cetpi-StyledImage e9fo5th0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1vhm7mh-StyledFigCaptionText elinl0r4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1vt5x9l-Caption elinl0r3&quot;&gt;File image of a tourist feeding the dolphins at Tin Can Bay.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Credit: David Potts&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;AAP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;He speculated it may be a “play-like behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“They often play with bits of weed and coral and all sorts of things and just leave it on their rostrum (nose),” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“They’re used to getting fed now, so they’re used to humans coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1316j2p-StyledParagraph enqfv0t0&quot;&gt;“When it’s not happening, maybe it’s just out of boredom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China to impose sweeping national security law in Hong Kong, bypassing city's legislature&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG - China's Communist Party will impose a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong by fiat during the annual meeting of its top political body, officials said Thursday, criminalizing &quot;foreign interference&quot; along with secessionist activities and subversion of state power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is the boldest yet from Beijing to undercut Hong Kong's autonomy and bring the global financial hub under its full control, as it works to rewrite the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; framework that has allowed the territory to enjoy a level of autonomy for the past 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After steadily eroding Hong Kong's political freedoms, Beijing signaled that the national security law will be a new tool that allows it to directly tackle the political dissent that erupted on Hong Kong's streets last year. The months-long and sometimes violent protests began last June and fizzled out only over public health concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new tactic marks an escalation in Beijing's crackdown in the former British colony and the clearest indication that it views Hong Kong as a restive region to be brought to heel after last year's protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city's future has become a point of contention in the intensifying rivalry between China and the United States; on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was &quot;closely watching what's going on&quot; in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have directly appealed to Washington for intervention, frequently waving American flags on the streets, and see themselves as the last bastion of resistance against an increasingly assertive Beijing under President Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beijing has opted for the most risky route,&quot; said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;It will show the world that 'one country, two systems' is, if not already over, almost over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;It will be very difficult for anyone, especially the United States, to say Hong Kong is still autonomous and viable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, China made clear it was asserting control over Hong Kong through &quot;improvement&quot; of its governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will ensure the long-term stability of 'one country, two systems,' &quot; Wang Yang, head of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the opening of the annual meeting of China's top political advisory body. The meeting is the first part of the Two Sessions political gatherings, which will continue Friday with the National People's Congress (NPC), the rubber-stamp parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will continue to support the improvement of the implementation of the systems and mechanisms of the constitution and Basic Law,&quot; Wang said in a report to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Thursday, representatives from Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office met with Hong Kong delegates to China's legislature to explain the details of the national security law. The law, a direct response to last year's protests, will ban secession, subversion of state power, foreign interference and terrorism, said Stanley Ng, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, who attended the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation could pass as early as next week and will bypass all of Hong Kong's usual processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar laws were proposed in 2003 and would have allowed authorities to conduct searches without warrants. But they were abandoned after mass protests and never picked up locally again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The social unrest last year showed that the Hong Kong government was unable to handle passing [national security legislation] on its own,&quot; said Ng, a Beijing loyalist who has for years pushed for a similar law. &quot;Hong Kong's status will be sacrificed with or without this law if society is unstable due to the protesters' violence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang Yesui, the spokesman for the NPC session, said in comments to Chinese media that Hong Kong is an &quot;inseparable&quot; part of China and that national security is the cornerstone of stability in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In light of new circumstances and needs, the National People's Congress is exercising the power that is enshrined in the [Chinese] constitution to establish and improve&quot; Hong Kong's legal framework, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong dollar weakened sharply against the U.S. dollar as the reports emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing blamed last year's unrest on secessionist forces and foreign influence. A government proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China touched off the unrest, but the movement grew into a broader and sometimes violent rebellion calling for full democracy and opposing China's efforts to chip away at Hong Kong's firewall with the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has sharply stepped up denunciations of China over his claims it failed to warn the world of the coronavirus dangers in the outbreak's early weeks. But his comments on Hong Kong were less direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know what it is because nobody knows yet,&quot; Trump told reporters as he left the White House. &quot;If it happens, we'll address that issue very strongly.&quot; He did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the State Department, spokesman Morgan Ortagus called China's expected move &quot;highly destabilizing&quot; for Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong would be highly destabilizing,&quot; she said, &quot;and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang did not elaborate on what &quot;improvement&quot; meant. But he also referred to the Chinese territory of Macao, a gambling hub where open displays of political dissent are rare and where most leaders toe Beijing's line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift will have far-reaching effects. Under the agreement Britain signed with China before it handed back Hong Kong in 1997, the territory is supposed to enjoy its relative freedoms until at least 2047 under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arrangement helped Hong Kong to flourish as a global financial center even after returning to Beijing's overall control, and has allowed the United States and other nations to treat the city differently to China. It also allowed Hong Kong to run its own affairs, except foreign affairs and defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But under Xi's leadership, the Communist Party has encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy with stunning speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm speechless,&quot; said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker, of the proposed national security legislation. Kwok was singled out for criticism by Beijing and was recently removed from his chairmanship of a key legislative council committee. &quot;This is a complete and total surprise and I think it means the end of one country, two systems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwok said that the Hong Kong government and Beijing had used the coronavirus pandemic as cover to clamp down on the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the world is not watching they are killing Hong Kong, killing one country, two systems, and using social distancing rules to keep people from coming out to protest,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the most devastating thing to happen to Hong Kong since the handover.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Pompeo warned China about its actions in Hong Kong, saying that the city's pro-democracy lawmakers had been &quot;manhandled&quot; this week &quot;while trying to stop a procedural irregularity by pro-Beijing legislators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leading Hong Kong activists like Martin Lee and Jimmy Lai were hauled into court,&quot; Pompeo told a news conference in Washington. &quot;Actions like these make it more difficult to assess that Hong Kong remains highly autonomous from mainland China,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the United States to treat Hong Kong as a separate entity, mostly for commercial purposes, the State Department must certify that the city retains &quot;a high degree of autonomy&quot; from China. Pompeo said its latest decision on this was still pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Foreign Ministry, through its office of the commissioner to Hong Kong, said Thursday that Pompeo was &quot;blackmailing&quot; the Hong Kong government and accused him of &quot;blatant interference&quot; in China's internal affairs. It also took aim at Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for placing &quot;unjustifiable pressure on China's central government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Certain U.S. politicians are repeatedly carping on about [Hong Kong's] legislative and judiciary branches in a vain attempt to glorify and exculpate the rioters who oppose China and seek to stir up trouble in Hong Kong,&quot; it said. &quot;They just don't want to see Hong Kong heal its divides and get back on track: Their sinister motives are thoroughly exposed, and their 'black hands' are bared for all to see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Beijing has installed a tough new representative in Hong Kong, called for patriotic education to instill more allegiance to China, and promoted a bill that would make it a criminal offense to disrespect China's national anthem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates from Hong Kong, including Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, arrived in Beijing on Thursday for the Two Sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang said Beijing supports the Hong Kong deputies' efforts to &quot;avoid violence in Hong Kong and to restore order.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as news of the proposal spread, calls were issued for more mass protests in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The arms of tyranny have reached Hong Kong,&quot; said Ted Hui, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was a regular participant in protests last year. &quot;Darker days are coming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifield reported from New Zealand. The Washington Post's Timothy McLaughlin in Hong Kong, Yuan Wang in Beijing and Carol Morello in Washington contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The FBI tracking your browsing history without a warrant might be the beginning</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;While much of the world is focussed on the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Senate recently voted to expand its surveillance powers. As part of a reauthorization of the Patriot Act, &lt;strong&gt;law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and CIA can continue to look through the browsing history of American citizens without the need for a warrant&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was arguably created with good intentions, some believe this is just the beginning of governments around the world using the coronavirus pandemic to usher in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2020/04/26/the-coronavirus-pandemic-shouldnt-legitimize-permanent-surveillance-after-the-crisis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;new surveillance measures&lt;/a&gt;. Some have even suggested that the Patriot Act enables those in power to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/05/13/if-doesnt-give-you-chills-i-dont-know-what-will-mcconnell-patriot-act-expansion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;spy on their political opponents &lt;/a&gt;without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of techies are browsing the web through a VPN to prevent their ISP from tracking their online habits for these very reasons. But in this case, the FBI could request logs from your VPN provider, too. The smartphones and smart speakers armed with microphones, cameras, and tracking abilities can suddenly feel quite sinister. Are we paranoid? Or are there dark forces at work that don’t necessarily have our best interests at heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you take the red pill or the blue pill?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these uncertain times, movies such as 1984 and 12 Monkeys are beginning to feel like documentaries. As a result, many are beginning to question the illusion of their freedom. In the 1999 film, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, the character Morpheus offers the protagonist Neo the choice between taking a blue pill that will restore his experience of reality or a red pill that will reveal its true nature. Here in 2020, Elon Musk urged his 34 million followers to take the red pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Take the red pill 🌹&lt;/p&gt;
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1262076474565242880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that obliged quickly learned that there are now more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/90759-what-are-the-worlds-most-heavily-surveilled-cities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;CCTV cameras&lt;/a&gt; in London than in Beijing. The US government can spy on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/jgxxvk/senate-votes-to-allow-fbi-to-look-at-your-web-browsing-history-without-a-warrant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;browsing history&lt;/a&gt; and internet habits without a warrant while remaining quarantined in their home. Further research reveals any opinions that dare to drift from the official narrative are labelled as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/04/24/how-coronavirus-is-fuelling-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt; or disinformation and removed immediately and even as a method of censoring dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 24-hour rolling news channels attempt to control the narrative and spread fear, are governments really using the moments to increase surveillance powers? Many protesters believe that authorities are taking it a step further by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/nyregion/nypd-coronavirus.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt; to curtail free speech. The further down the rabbit hole you dare to go, the world feels more confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British filmmaker Adam Curtis highlighted in 2014 that this confusion is not an accident and actually a part of a new system of political control called &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyop0d30UqQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonlinear warfare.&lt;/a&gt; But the vast amounts of data on every member of the global community is now changing the political landscape again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is data the new nuclear power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back and join up the dots, it was Clive Humby, the mastermind behind the Tesco Clubcard, that first declared that data was the new oil in 2006. But it was TED speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.ted.com/opinion-data-isnt-the-new-oil-its-the-new-nuclear-power/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;James Bridle&lt;/a&gt;, who argued it was actually a new nuclear power that could do harm. Silicon Valley has already infamously used personal data to take advantage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/2020/1/10/2020_election_digital_manipulation_cambridge_analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;nefarious ways&lt;/a&gt;, and now governments appear intent on doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Snowden once said that “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” He went on to add, “When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-shoulders-of-giants-recent-changes-in-internet-traffic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; recently reported that internet usage surged by 40 percent in Seattle during the pandemic’s peak period. From the comfort of their homes, users continued to endlessly scroll down newsfeeds and distracted themselves with escapist entertainment. But we all need more than mindless repetition, three-word slogans, and agreeing 100% with the narrative and policies of our governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technology that was developed to unite us, must never divide us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that some are using the global pandemic as an opportunity to make a power grab. Personal data and browsing habits that are run through algorithms, as well as databases can be used to build a profile of who we are and predict our future actions. As a result, global citizens increasingly become more cautious with how they act online in case it is misconstrued or used against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look on a Facebook newsfeed will reveal that many of your friends cannot be bothered to research anything important, but they will take a 15-minute quiz to find out what kind of vegetable they are. In a digital world where every form of communication, transaction, and movement can be monitored, we can no longer afford to sleepwalk our way through life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often said that technology works best when it brings people together, but it currently feels like we are losing our way. Binary thinking is resulting in polarization and driving a wedge between communities rather than uniting them. Authorities asking users to film non-compliant citizens and turn people against each other during a crisis is beginning to feel a little too reminiscent of an Orwellian nightmare for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future generations will be affected by what we do next. But there is hope. When&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/de-blasio-urges-new-yorkers-to-snitch-on-social-distance-rule-breakers/&quot;&gt; Mayor Bill de Blasio&lt;/a&gt; urged New Yorkers to use the technology on their smartphones to snitch on social distance rule-breakers, communities united in flooding the service with dick pics and memes. The scale of the response forced the city to shut down the service temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there evidence that mass surveillance programs enable governments to protect citizens and save lives? Or do they run the risk of being used as a tool to discredit anyone that authorities deem to be a threat? These are all debates that we should all be having. Contrary to popular belief, the future doesn’t belong to those that mindlessly obey every instruction. Being armed with a curious mind and the need to ask questions should be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to feel comfortable consuming content from an echo chamber that spoon-feeds your opinions back to you. But this world is a stark contrast to Apple’s Think Differently campaign in 1997 that celebrated the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, and the round pegs in the square holes that wanted to change the world for the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, will you choose to take the red pill or the blue pill?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TI removes access to assembly programs on the TI-83 Premium CE</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TI removes access to assembly programs on the TI-83 Premium CE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:critor@ticalc.org&quot;&gt;Xavier&lt;/a&gt; on 20 May 2020, 21:35 GMT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We're sad to relay news about the fact that in the currently latest OS 5.5.1 version released today for the TI-83 Premium CE &amp;amp; TI-83 Premium CE Edition Python (such a mouthful ^^), TI completely removed access to assembly programs... Support for unsquished ASM programs was already removed earlier in OS 5.3.1 onwards, though it didn't matter much at the time, because squished ASM programs remained unharmed. Yes, TI has retroactively removed an advertised feature, many a user's favorite feature at that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This slam shuts a golden age of over two decades (!) of native code being &lt;u&gt;officially&lt;/u&gt; supported on at least one &lt;em&gt;actively maintained&lt;/em&gt; TI graphing calculator model. Unofficial availability of native code started a bit earlier, thanks to arbitrary code execution achievable through specially crafted backup files. Thousands of programmers have published thousands of programs (and produced even more), many of these published programs can be found in the ticalc.org archives, because ticalc.org has been around since 1996, i.e. for the entire period of official native code availability, give or take a few months time :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As far as we can tell, TI did not make this move out of the blue. The trigger was probably a teacher posting, on his popular video channel, a video about a long-fixed flaw in an earlier version TI's implementation of PTT mode for the TI-eZ80 series. The fix is from 2018, the video was posted in 2020. Shortly thereafter, we can imagine that TI had to give in to pressure from some people who regulate standardized tests (as a matter of fact, they, not end users, are the real customers TI needs to appease). Needless to say, removing user access to native code has &lt;strong&gt;extremely little&lt;/strong&gt; to do with exam security...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, looking at what happened time and again on other platforms, e.g. the Sony PS3, we can confidently predict that this move will &lt;em&gt;worsen&lt;/em&gt; exam security. From now on, the French 83 Premium CE, and certainly the international 84+ CE versions thereof in the near future, are in the same situation as the Nspire platform: a cat &amp;amp; mouse game of jailbreaks, fixes, and newer jailbreaks. Both the Nspire series and the TI-eZ80 series are insecure platforms, all the more users have unrestricted physical access to their calculators; more generally, at the time of this writing, no manufacturer produces any secure graphing calculator model, but the people who regulate standardized tests don't know or don't care...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like all true calculator enthusiasts, we have hard feelings about the matter. The community had always been nice to TI - nothing really damaging for TI's business was ever released over 20+ years! - but a moral barrier has probably been broken today... However, there are so many much worse things in life, so let's focus on the future instead. It's the beginning of a new era - certainly an era of heightened tension. For now, let's only send our warmest thanks to all past, present and future programmers of native code programs for TI graphing calculators... and on to the new, upcoming chapters of a still ongoing story :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The news wishlist contains a number of TI-eZ80 ASM programs, among other things; even without future POTY votes, we'll keep featuring programs as time permits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reddit&amp;#039;s top user leaves platform after harassment</title>
<link>https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-moderators-quit/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-moderators-quit/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;170.87061994609&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Reddit’s most prolific posters and moderators is speaking out about the continuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-awards-harassment/&quot;&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; and threats he’s experienced on the platform, and what he sees as a lack of support from administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Allam, known to redditors as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/GallowBoob/&quot;&gt;GallowBoob&lt;/a&gt;, is one of Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandoalfonso/2016/06/01/cashing-in-karma-how-a-former-landscape-architect-turned-his-reddit-fame-into-a-career/#7b989f4a128a&quot;&gt;most famous users&lt;/a&gt;. He leads the site in karma points—more than 36 million—and oversees dozens of subreddits. As someone influential on the internet, Allam is familiar with backlash, which he says has come in “waves” over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, he’s reached a breaking point. A posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/gk0w4c/to_have_independently_moderated_subreddits/&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;, flagging him and a small group of others moderators for being behind many of Reddit’s largest channels, has led to a swell of threats against Allam and others named. In response, Allam told the Daily Dot he plans to step back from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After this, I am personally done with supporting the platform when it doesn’t support us back or doesn’t do enough to safeguard our security,” Allam said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of top moderators has been circulating on the site for the past month, but it went viral towards the end of last week. Though the names of subreddit moderators are publicly available, the image still struck a nerve with redditors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/rootin-tootin_putin/&quot;&gt;Rootin-tootin_putin&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of many that reposted it. The users says they hoped to, “shed a little bit of light on just how monopolised Reddit has become.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once a fairly free site, in the wake of these power mods it has become restricted and apersonal,” Rootin-tootin_putin continued in an email to the Daily Dot. “The point of peer moderators was to ensure that the person in charge of a sub was someone who genuinely cares about the topic; these power mods undermine this entirely.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most popular post linking to the list was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/&quot;&gt;r/therewasanattempt&lt;/a&gt;, where it received more than 100,000 upvotes before being removed by Reddit’s Community team. In a pinned comment, administrator sodypop explained it led to “large-scale harassment” of those named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…this situation has gone far past the point of criticism and is now generating targeted harassment of numerous people, some of whom are concerned for their physical safety,” the Reddit administrator said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sodypop’s comment came after at least one of the moderators on the list, cyXie, deleted their account in response to the backlash. cyXie was responsible for moderating some of the site’s largest subreddits, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&quot;&gt;r/gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/&quot;&gt;r/pics&lt;/a&gt;. The list revealed a dwindling number of so-called “power mods” like cyXie are responsible for moderating millions of redditors each, which fueled criticism and conspiracy theories about their identities and intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the list, the same five moderators help run 92 of the site’s 500 biggest subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Slack conversation with administrators, Allam showed the Daily Dot, Reddit staff acknowledged the issue hours before removing the viral post. He provided the Daily Dot with additional screenshots showing death threats and hacking attempts against him, also pointing to negative private &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GallowBoob_Removal&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt; on the site created about him (some of which have since been removed).&lt;/p&gt;

It’s nothing I would wish on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allam believes his time on the site has made him a more “paranoid” person and led him to develop “borderline PTSD.” He says Reddit does nothing to “train” or prepare moderators—who are unpaid volunteers—for troubling situations he has faced, such as reporting child pornography or dealing with doxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The administration doesn’t do nearly enough to secure moderation on Reddit and offers us zero mental health support when we develop PTSD just like any paid mods on Facebook and other platforms,” Allam elaborated, referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-content-moderators-lawsuit/&quot;&gt;recent settlement&lt;/a&gt; between Facebook and its moderators, who allegedly developed psychological trauma from their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, a Reddit spokesperson told the Daily Dot, “Moderators have access to crisis management and general resources in our &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041256671&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mod Help Center&lt;/a&gt; and we have also established Community Councils to work closely with moderators on important issues or announcements happening across the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson also pointed to Reddit’s &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/fdh4rr/announcing_our_partnership_and_ama_with_crisis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;partnership with Crisis Text Line&lt;/a&gt;, which allows administrators to connect at-risk users with virtual counselors. This program is not specifically directed at moderators but available for any users on the platform who have expressed concerning thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health issues stemming from moderation are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/&quot;&gt;well-documented&lt;/a&gt; across social media sites, including Twitter, YouTube, and perhaps most famously, Facebook. The aforementioned lawsuit against Facebook was a milestone in raising awareness about the significant psychological toll of the role. As part of the company’s settlement, it was told to develop new workflows and procedures to “mitigate the effects of exposure to graphic and disturbing material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Reddit’s volunteer model, though the majority of other social platforms pay for moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allam says he plans to step away from the vast majority of his moderating responsibilities, acknowledging that those who took issue with his role are getting their desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They think they won, but others are going to replace us,” he added. “The admins don’t care if they lose moderators, too, because 50 new mods are gonna be like, ‘Yep I’ll take over.’ But they have no idea what they’re getting into.”&lt;/p&gt;
