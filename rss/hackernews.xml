<title>Mozilla lays off 70</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/?guccounter=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/?guccounter=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/mozilla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; laid off about 70 employees today, TechCrunch has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an internal memo, Mozilla chairwoman and interim &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/leadership/#mitchell-baker&quot;&gt;CEO Mitchell Baker&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions the slow rollout of the organization’s new revenue-generating products as the reason for why it needed to take this action. The overall number may still be higher, though, as Mozilla is still looking into how this decision will affect workers in the U.K. and France. In 2018, Mozilla Corporation (as opposed to the much smaller Mozilla Foundation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2018/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had about 1,000 employees worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may recall that we expected to be earning revenue in 2019 and 2020 from new subscription products as well as higher revenue from sources outside of search. This did not happen,” Baker writes in her memo. “Our 2019 plan underestimated how long it would take to build and ship new, revenue-generating products. Given that, and all we learned in 2019 about the pace of innovation, we decided to take a more conservative approach to projecting our revenue for 2020. We also agreed to a principle of living within our means, of not spending more than we earn for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.0194346289753&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.434628975265&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mozilla has decided to lay some folks off and restructure things. All the leads in QA got let go. I haven’t been let go (so far). No idea what I will be working on or who I will be reporting to. Some good work friends let go :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Chris Hartjes (@grmpyprogrammer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer/status/1217527164255592449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker says laid-off employees will receive “generous exit packages” and outplacement support. She also notes that the leadership team looked into shutting down the Mozilla innovation fund but decided that it needed it in order to continue developing new products. In total, Mozilla is dedicating $43 million to building new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we look to the future, we know we must take bold steps to evolve and ensure the strength and longevity of our mission,” Baker writes. “Mozilla has a strong line of sight to future revenue generation, but we are taking a more conservative approach to our finances. This will enable us to pivot as needed to respond to market threats to internet health, and champion user privacy and agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization last &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/mozilla-layoffs/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; major layoffs in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last few months, Mozilla started testing a number of new products, most of which will be subscription-based once they launch. The marquee feature here is including its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/mozilla-launches-the-next-beta-phase-of-its-firefox-private-network-vpn/&quot;&gt;Firefox Private Network&lt;/a&gt; and a device-level VPN service that is yet to launch, but will cost around $4.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is part of the organization’s plans to become less reliant on income from search partnerships and to create more revenue channels. &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2018/mozilla-fdn-2018-short-form-final-0926.pdf&quot;&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the latest year for which Mozilla has published its financial records, about 91% of its royalty revenues came from search contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;We have reached out to Mozilla for comment and will update this post once we hear more.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (1pm PT):&lt;/strong&gt; In a statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/01/15/readying-for-the-future-at-mozilla/&quot;&gt;posted to the Mozilla blog&lt;/a&gt;, Mitchell Baker reiterates that Mozilla had to make these cuts in order to fund innovation. “Mozilla has a strong line of sight on future revenue generation from our core business,” she writes. “In some ways, this makes this action harder, and we are deeply distressed about the effect on our colleagues. However, to responsibly make additional investments in innovation to improve the internet, we can and must work within the limits of our core finances”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the full memo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office of the CEO &amp;lt;officeoftheceo@mozilla.com&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to all-moco-mofo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some difficult news to share. With the support of the entire Steering Committee and our Board, we have made an extremely tough decision: over the course of today, we plan to eliminate about 70 roles from across MoCo. This number may be slightly larger as we are still in a consultation process in the UK and France, as the law requires, on the exact roles that may be eliminated there. We are doing this with the utmost respect for each and every person who is impacted and will go to great lengths to take care of them by providing generous exit packages and outplacement support. Most will not join us in Berlin. I will send another note when we have been able to talk to the affected people wherever possible, so that you will know when the notifications/outreach are complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This news likely comes as a shock and I am sorry that we could not have been more transparent with you along the way. This is never my desire. Reducing our headcount was something the Steering Committee considered as part of our 2020 planning and budgeting exercise only after all other avenues were explored. The final decision was made just before the holiday break with the work to finalize the exact set of roles affected continuing into early January (there are exceptions in the UK and France where we are consulting on decisions.) I made the decision not to communicate about this until we had a near-final list of roles and individuals affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I expect it will be difficult to digest right now, I would like to share more about what led to this decision. Perhaps you can come back to it later, if that’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall that we expected to be earning revenue in 2019 and 2020 from new subscription products as well as higher revenue from sources outside of search. This did not happen. Our 2019 plan underestimated how long it would take to build and ship new, revenue-generating products. Given that, and all we learned in 2019 about the pace of innovation, we decided to take a more conservative approach to projecting our revenue for 2020. We also agreed to a principle of living within our means, of not spending more than we earn for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is prudent certainly, but challenging practically. In our case, it required difficult decisions with painful results. Regular annual pay increases, bonuses and other costs which increase from year-to-year as well as a continuing need to maintain a separate, substantial innovation fund, meant that we had to look for considerable savings across Mozilla as part of our 2020 planning and budgeting process. This process ultimately led us to the decision to reduce our workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might ask if we considered foregoing the separate innovation fund, continuing as we did in 2019. The answer is yes but we ultimately decided we could not, in good faith, adopt this. Mozilla’s future depends on us excelling at our current work and developing new offerings to expand our impact. And creating the new products we need to change the future requires us to do things differently, including allocating funds, $43M to be specific, for this purpose. We will discuss our plans for making innovation robust and successful in increasing detail as we head into, and then again at, the All Hands, rather than trying to do so here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look to the future, we know we must take bold steps to evolve and ensure the strength and longevity of our mission. Mozilla has a strong line of sight to future revenue generation, but we are taking a more conservative approach to our finances. This will enable us to pivot as needed to respond to market threats to internet health, and champion user privacy and agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that we all do what we can to support each other through this difficult period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Climate threats now dominate long-term risks, survey of global leaders finds</title>
<link>http://news.trust.org/item/20200115150054-km9of/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://news.trust.org/item/20200115150054-km9of/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;lead-text&quot;&gt;Long-term risks from climate change now outweigh those from cyberattacks, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and weapons of mass destruction, decision-makers say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Laurie Goering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Climate-change-related threats such as extreme weather, large-scale biodiversity losses and a failure of political leaders to slow planetary heating are now the top long-term risks facing the globe, business and other leaders said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An annual risk survey published ahead of the World Economic Forum next week put climate threats ahead of risks ranging from cyberattacks and pandemics to geopolitical conflict and weapons of mass destruction for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's new. Last year we didn't have it,&quot; said Mirek Dusek, deputy head of the Centre for Geopolitical and Regional Affairs and an executive committee member of the World Economic Forum, of the rise of environmental issues up the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift comes as climate-changing emissions continue to rise strongly globally, despite government and business commitments to reduce them, and as the potential impact of runaway climate change becomes clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From wildfires in Australia, Brazil and California to worsening storms, floods and droughts, &quot;all key indicators point that this is a situation that's bad and it's getting worse,&quot; said John Drzik, chairman of Marsh &amp;amp; McLennan Insights, a global risk, insurance and professional services firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water and food crises - problems similarly linked to climate shifts - also featured high among long-term worries for the approximately 800 business, government and civil society leaders worldwide who filled out the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drzik said a surge in climate change activism was putting &quot;lots of pressure&quot; on governments and business to do more, but that other risks - such as growing political polarisation and insularity - were simultaneously making climate action harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But businesses face a growing range of climate-related risks, from unexpected regulatory changes to rapid shifts in consumer preferences and litigation linked to inaction on climate change, he said, all of which can help drive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, 370 investors managing $40 trillion in assets have now pledged to make their investments climate friendly, Drzik said, in part because of shareholder pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borge Brende, the Norwegian president of the World Economic Forum, said it was increasingly clear that on climate change, &quot;the cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of action&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the survey's finding that &quot;domestic political polarisation&quot; is one of the top worries for the year 2020, calling it a barrier to effective climate action, such as reaching agreement to make polluters pay the costs of their emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Giger, chief risk officer for the Zurich Insurance Group, warned that &quot;the longer we wait (to tackle climate change), the more painful the transition will be&quot; because of the rapid plunge in emissions that delay would necessitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he said making the transition to a greener, low-carbon and more sustainable economy was now &quot;an existential challenge for everyone on this planet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the rapid disappearance of insect species around the world, including those that pollinate 75% of the world's crops, as a result of climate change and other pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If insects and the pollination services they provide disappear, &quot;that's a catastrophic outcome&quot; for food security and for business, Giger said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of planetary systems has &quot;true costs&quot;, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

At Ignite, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/04/introducing-the-new-microsoft-edge-and-bing/#6F7IJlaq6s1iMc9i.97&quot;&gt;we unveiled our new vision for the web and search&lt;/a&gt;, our colorful new icon, and how Microsoft Edge + Bing are the browser and search engine for business — and we are thrilled by the growing excitement we’ve heard from all of you who’ve tried it out and sent feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this incredible momentum, today I’m pleased to announce the new Microsoft Edge is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge?form=MO12GC&amp;amp;OCID=MO12GC&quot;&gt;available to download&lt;/a&gt; on all supported versions of Windows and macOS in more than 90 languages. Microsoft Edge is also available on iOS and Android, providing a true cross-platform experience. The new Microsoft Edge provides world class performance with more privacy, more productivity and more value while you browse. Our new browser also comes with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoftedgewelcome.microsoft.com/privacy?source=blog&quot;&gt;Privacy Promise&lt;/a&gt; and we can’t wait for you to try new features like tracking prevention, which is on by default, and provides three levels of control while you browse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another innovative new feature in Microsoft Edge allows you to customize your online experience. Choose a new tab page layout or design, and select the types of news you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/309097d2b6292e65df7eb70c7ac47743.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-173532&quot; src=&quot;https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/309097d2b6292e65df7eb70c7ac47743-1024x674.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Edge user interface&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;674&quot; srcset=&quot;https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/309097d2b6292e65df7eb70c7ac47743-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/309097d2b6292e65df7eb70c7ac47743-300x197.jpg 300w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/309097d2b6292e65df7eb70c7ac47743-768x505.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last several months have been nothing short of inspiring for all of us working to deliver great new capabilities for Microsoft Edge including AAD support, Internet Explorer mode, 4K streaming, Dolby audio, inking in PDF, Microsoft Search in Bing integration, support for Chrome-based extensions, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a business or education IT administrator looking to deploy widely in your organization or school, we have you covered as well – you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge/business/download?form=MO12G8&amp;amp;OCID=MO12G8&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; offline packages and policies and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge/business?form=MO12G9&amp;amp;OCID=MO12G9&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt; on the new commercial site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/17d9035e5ff5492e1e81864b6626f91b.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-173533&quot; src=&quot;https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/01/17d9035e5ff5492e1e81864b6626f91b.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Internet Explorer legacy mode animation&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have downloaded the preview channels of the new Microsoft Edge millions of times to their devices, and we’ve seen many organizations begin to pilot these channels for their users. Enterprises and schools who have mission critical legacy applications and websites – but also want modern web and security – have turned to our new Internet Explorer mode as a “best of both worlds” solution. And for Microsoft 365 customers, using Microsoft Search to find files, people, office floor plans and more on your organization’s intranet is as easy as typing in the Microsoft Edge address bar. Our early customers are calling it “a win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving to the new Microsoft Edge – what to expect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve reached this milestone, you might be wondering what to expect on your PC. To get the new Microsoft Edge you have two choices: you can either manually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge?form=MO12GC&amp;amp;OCID=MO12GC&quot;&gt;download it today&lt;/a&gt;, or if you are a general consumer user, you can wait for it to be automatically released to your device via Windows Update. When you do make the switch, your favorites, passwords, form fill information and basic settings will carry over to the new Microsoft Edge without you having to do anything. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/01/15/upgrading-new-microsoft-edge-79-chromium&quot;&gt;read more about our rollout plans here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an IT administrator, you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge/business/download?form=MO12G8&amp;amp;OCID=MO12G8&quot;&gt;download an offline deployment package&lt;/a&gt; to pilot within your corporate environment—the new Microsoft Edge will not automatically deploy for commercial customers. Additionally, none of the Microsoft Edge preview channels will update to the new Microsoft Edge, as they can be used side-by-side for testing and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that deploying a new browser isn’t just “flipping a switch,” so we want to make the process as easy as possible. In addition to simplifying deployment with tools like Intune and Configuration Manager, we are committed to helping your organization transition to the new Microsoft Edge. At Ignite we announced FastTrack and App Assure support for Microsoft Edge. FastTrack will help you deploy Microsoft Edge to your organization at no extra charge if you are a customer with an eligible subscription to Microsoft 365, Azure, or Dynamics 365. And if your sites are compatible on Internet Explorer 8 and above, Google Chrome, or legacy Microsoft Edge, then they’ll work on the new Microsoft Edge. If not, contact App Assure and we’ll help you fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the innovation, testing, and new features don’t stop coming today, and this initial release is only just the beginning. If you want a sneak peek of what’s coming, we encourage you to keep using our preview channels – Beta, Dev and Canary – which will remain available for download on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/edge?form=MO12GG&amp;amp;OCID=MO12GG&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge Insider site&lt;/a&gt;. Not only will you get an insider’s look at our features pipeline for Microsoft Edge, but you’ll continue to have the opportunity to help improve Microsoft Edge with your valuable feedback. Your input helps make both the new Microsoft Edge, and the web, better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to our community of Microsoft Edge Insiders as well as the engineers within the Chromium community who have worked with us to develop the new Microsoft Edge. We remain committed to actively participating in and contributing to the Chromium open source project. To date we’ve made more than 1900 contributions across areas like accessibility, modern input including touch, speech, digital inking, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep telling us what’s working well, what needs to change and what you’d like to see in the new Microsoft Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our heartfelt thanks – we couldn’t have made it here without you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JoeB&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CollegeHumor shuts down</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;8.9692307692308&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;At the heart of that goofy, bygone Internet was a joke site launched by two college freshmen in 1999 that curated the funniest posts on the Internet and quickly grew into a comedy sketch behemoth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehumor.com/static/about&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drawing more than 100 million page views a month&lt;/a&gt; at its height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;CollegeHumor carved out a niche in Web content, handpicking the next funny viral video for an audience of mostly young men who made appealing targets for online advertisers. It also created a network of writers, comics and actors who have also shaped more traditional entertainment, from shows like HBO’s “Girls” and “Silicon Valley” to “Saturday Night Live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;More than two decades later, CollegeHumor’s reign over hilarious online videos and its influence in the world of comedy may be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15.1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, the site’s parent company, IAC/InterActive Corp., sold CH Media — the overarching name for CollegeHumor, its streaming platform and a few other websites. The sale left more than 100 employees without jobs. CH Media’s new owner, Sam Reich, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samreich/status/1214985379343822849?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; the layoffs and sale Wednesday on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;“In words that I’m sure are as surreal to read as they are to type, I will soon become the new majority owner of CH Media,” said Reich, a longtime executive at CollegeHumor. “Of course, I can’t keep it going like you’re used to. While we were on the way to becoming profitable, we were nonetheless losing money — and I myself have no money to be able to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div data-oembed-type=&quot;twitter&quot; class=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;9.8988549618321&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;13.198473282443&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, bad news – with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⁰IAC, our parent company, has made the difficult decision to no longer finance us. Today, 100+ brilliant people lost their jobs, some of whom are my dear, dear friends. Hire them. (thread)&lt;/p&gt;
— Sam Reich (@samreich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samreich/status/1214985379343822849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13.419087136929&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;Dropout, its streaming service, will continue for at least the next six months while it churns out content already slated for release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samreich/status/1214985381457739776?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reich said&lt;/a&gt;. The future of CollegeHumor itself, and other humor sites run by the company, are less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;“In these six months, I hope to be able to save Dropout, CollegeHumor, Drawfee, Dorkly, and many of our shows,” Reich said. “Some will need to take on bold new creative directions in order to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;11.831884057971&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;Founded by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen, CollegeHumor began as a landing pad for funny photos of the two college freshmen and their friends doing “stupid college stuff,” Abramson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/fashion/sundaystyles/sophomorically-incorrect.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told the New York Times in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. They posted a lot of immature gags, like sticking metal utensils in a toaster and smacking an unsuspecting man with a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;12.798913043478&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/streetseidell?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streeter Seidell&lt;/a&gt;, now a writer for “SNL,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/weekinreview/20seidell.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described the site’s target audience&lt;/a&gt; in a 2008 Times column he wrote while editing and writing for CollegeHumor: It’s for “the kid you’d like to &lt;em&gt;kick out&lt;/em&gt; of the house — a son aged 18 to 24 who, say, rises for Pop-Tarts at the crack of noon, or wails on Guitar Hero III — his is the spare time we’re after.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10.642673521851&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;By then, CollegeHumor had secured its place among a few highly successful comedy websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.funnyordie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Funny or Die&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cracked.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cracked&lt;/a&gt;. The site published jokes so fresh and successful that more established entertainment programs sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/arts/television/13comics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ripped them off&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, the creators of Comedy Central’s “South Park” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/25/south-park-sorry-for-stealing-inception-jokes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; for lifting dialogue from a CollegeHumor riff on the movie “Inception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15.200378071834&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;The site’s most popular original content was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehumor.com/videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its Web series&lt;/a&gt;, from “Hardly Working,” a look at the strangeness and monotony of working in an office, to “Jake and Amir,” which parodied the relationship between two fictionalized CollegeHumor writers and netted about 1 billion views altogether, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/53vjez/jake-and-amirs-decade-of-perfect-timing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to Vice&lt;/a&gt;. Those shows often launched expansive careers for the stars, like Jake Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld, who have spun off a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/03/31/need-expert-advice-dont-ask-jake-and-amir/?tid=lk_inline_manual_21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/lonely-and-horny-and-little-comedy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another Web series&lt;/a&gt; built on the success of their partnership at CollegeHumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;Many of its past creators mourned Wednesday’s sale online, some with biting commentary for IAC/InterActive Corp.'s chairman and senior executive, Barry Diller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10.701550387597&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;“Shout out to everyone who worked burnout hours down the comedy mines to make sure that Barry Diller’s Yacht had extra, like, yacht ropes or whatever. Dude definitely deserves it!!” Siobhan Thompson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1214989817718591488&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; shortly after news of the sale became public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;11.631284916201&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;She &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1215121674502205440?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;followed up&lt;/a&gt; with an account of how CollegeHumor helped launch her career: “I don’t know how I, and everyone else who has ever been in the cast, would have made it into the industry if it weren’t for places like CH. Where are the starter jobs in comedy now? Where can you make things without having the money to make them yourself? It worries me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;But for all of its success, the company’s inclination to make big moves online probably led to its demise, as several former employees noted Wednesday. CollegeHumor’s decision to partner with Facebook, in particular, probably sounded the death knell for the humor site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;10.96875&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;“In order to beat YouTube, Facebook faked incredible viewership numbers, so [CollegeHumor] pivoted to FB,” former CollegeHumor writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/1183209875859333120?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adam Conover presciently tweeted last October&lt;/a&gt;. “So did Funny or Die, many others. The result: A once-thriving online comedy industry was decimated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10.601941747573&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-agrees-pay-advertisers-40-million-over-inflated-video-stats/2205101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;agreed to pay $40 million&lt;/a&gt; last year to settle a lawsuit after advertisers sued the social media giant for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/23/facebooks-secret-way-of-counting-video-views-was-wrong-all-along/?tid=lk_inline_manual_35&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inflating video metrics&lt;/a&gt; by up to 900 percent. But many former CollegeHumor staffers blamed the pivot to Facebook, which couldn’t deliver on its advertising promises, for the previously successful company’s collapse. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md&quot;&gt;“The slow (and then quick) death of CollegeHumor, Funny or Die, and your other favorite online comedy sites was not an accident,” Conover tweeted Wednesday. “It was the result of Facebook’s deliberate effort to kill the indie video industry, in part by massively falsifying viewer data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Researchers find inverse correlation between advertising and life satisfaction</title>
<link>https://hbr.org/2020/01/advertising-makes-us-unhappy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hbr.org/2020/01/advertising-makes-us-unhappy</guid>

&lt;p&gt;The University of Warwick’s Andrew Oswald and his team compared survey data on the life satisfaction of more than 900,000 citizens of 27 European countries from 1980 to 2011 with data on annual advertising spending in those nations over the same period. The researchers found an inverse connection between the two. The higher a country’s ad spend was in one year, the less satisfied its citizens were a year or two later. Their conclusion: Advertising makes us unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Professor Oswald, defend your research.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intervieweename&quot;&gt;Oswald:&lt;/span&gt; We did find a significant negative relationship. When you look at changes in national happiness each year and changes in ad spending that year or a few years earlier—and you hold other factors like GDP and unemployment constant—there is a link. This suggests that when advertisers pour money into a country, the result is diminished well-being for the people living there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;interviewname&quot;&gt;HBR:&lt;/span&gt; What prompted you to investigate this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Colleagues and I have been studying human happiness for 30 years now, and recently my focus turned to national happiness. What are the characteristics of a happy country? What are the forces that mold one? What explains the ups and downs? I’d never looked at advertising before, but I met a researcher who was collecting data on it for a different reason, and it seemed to me that we should combine forces. Like a lot of people in Western society, I can’t help noticing the increasing amount of ads we’re bombarded with. For me, it was natural to wonder whether it might create dissatisfaction in our culture: How is your happiness and mine shaped by what we see, hear, and read? I think it’s rather intuitive that lots of ads would make us less happy. In a sense they’re trying to generate dissatisfaction—stirring up your desires so that you spend more on goods and services to ease that feeling. I appreciate, of course, that the world’s corporate advertisers and marketing firms won’t like hearing me say that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Yeah, I don’t think they’d agree that that is the goal of advertising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Their line is that advertising is trying to expose the public to new and exciting things to buy, and their task is to simply provide information, and in that way they raise human well-being. But the alternative argument, which goes back to Thorstein Veblen and others, is that exposing people to a lot of advertising raises their aspirations—and makes them feel that their own lives, achievements, belongings, and experiences are inadequate. This study supports the negative view, not the positive one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;So ads make us want what we don’t or can’t have?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;The idea here is a very old one: Before I can decide how happy I am, I have to look over my shoulder, consciously or subconsciously, and see how other people are doing. Many of my feelings about my income, my car, and my house are molded by my next-door neighbor’s income, car, and house. That’s just part of being human: worrying about relative status. But we know from lots of research that making social comparisons can be harmful to us emotionally, and advertising prompts us to measure ourselves against others. If I see an ad for a fancy new car, it makes me think about my ordinary one, which might make me feel bad. If I see this $10,000 watch and then look at my watch, which I probably paid about $150 for, I might think, “Maybe there’s something wrong with me.” And of course nations are just agglomerations of individuals. Now, in this paper we don’t prove that the dissatisfaction is coming from relative comparisons, but we suspect that’s what happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;How do you know advertising is actually causing us to be unhappy? That this isn’t correlational?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;First, we controlled for lots of other influences on happiness. Second, we looked at increases or drops in advertising in a given year and showed that they successfully predicted a rise or fall in national happiness in ensuing years. Third, we did lots of statistical checks to make sure the empirical linkages were strong. Fourth, people sometimes forget that causality always requires there to be a correlation somewhere. But your question is constantly in my mind as a researcher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;But doesn’t this apply just to materialistic people? A lot of people understand that you can’t buy happiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Yes, some might see that watch ad and say, “Why are men buying $10,000 watches when they carry a mobile phone with the time on it?” Or respond to a car ad by congratulating themselves for not buying a gas-guzzler that’s expensive to service and destroys the environment. Our research shows that the really big influences on human happiness are things like health, intimate relationships, being employed, social safety nets, not being in midlife (there really is a crisis for many), and so on. Buying that watch or car can help make us feel slightly happier, but deep down it has a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses status effect. And when everybody buys the same thing the effect is nullified. That’s partly why advertising hurts group happiness; there’s only so much status to go around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;This reminds me of how social media makes us miserable because we compare ourselves with influencers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Yes. There is research bubbling up through the journals about this. For example, one longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 found that using Facebook was associated with compromised well-being. My hunch is that over the next few decades this will become a really serious policy issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Has any other research linked advertising with reduced well-being?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;The short answer is no. Although there’s some interesting literature on how children are affected by advertising in terms of their eating and health, there is surprisingly little on this topic. We don’t know of a paper close to ours. Perhaps there is one, but nobody’s written to us about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;How did you measure national advertising and national happiness?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;The advertising metric is straightforward accounting. We have data on the amount spent in different countries on different forms of ads: newspaper, radio, TV, and so on. Measuring happiness or life satisfaction is more complicated, but we now know how to do so reliably. In this study we have a large sample, close to a million people, and we decided to choose one of the most long-standing simple measures of human well-being, which is the survey question “How satisfied are you with your life?” People used a scale to answer it, and then we aggregated those answers for each country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;And you’re sure the lower life satisfaction isn’t due to the other things that you just mentioned affect it, like age and marital status?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Those are among the things we controlled for in addition to the unemployment rate and GDP. We also controlled for the underlying starting levels of happiness and advertising in countries, because we wanted to do a fair comparison with the same baseline. And year by year we controlled for what you might call shocks—think of oil-price shocks—that have a common set of consequences across the whole of Europe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;How big is the negative effect of ads?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Our analysis shows that if you doubled advertising spending, it would result in a 3% drop in life satisfaction. That’s about half the drop in life satisfaction you’d see in a person who had gotten divorced or about one-third the drop you’d see in someone who’d become unemployed. We have a lot of experience working out how people are affected by bad life events, and advertising has sizable consequences even when compared with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Is there anything we can do about this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;It’s worth wondering whether Western society has done the right thing by allowing large levels of advertising, almost unregulated, as though it were inevitable. Given these patterns, it seems like something we might want to think about. But we haven’t got any political punch line in this paper. We don’t recommend any policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;What if everyone just downloaded ad blockers for the web and fast-forwarded through commercials on TV? Would that help?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;I try to be an evenhanded statistical researcher, but I can see how you might look at our study and think, “Maybe it’s sensible for me to opt out of some of these ads.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glia uses an open-access research, development and distribution model to create high-quality low-cost medical devices that are then clinically validated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to change the way people interact with their devices. Providing communities with open-access low-cost medical devices fosters a culture of self-reliance and sustainability. If low-resource communities can access the equipment they need via an open-access model, they are empowered to troubleshoot problems, customize designs to meet their needs and share their findings with others. The ability to share successes in an open-access environment allows medical and technical communities to work together and avoid duplication of work and long feedback cycles. This model allows off-patent devices to exist as high-quality low-cost generic models, which also exerts downward pressure on prices for high-quality premium brands.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Consider this in contrast to some other fonts. Consolas, for example, has slightly wider letters. However, they are still rather small, which forces you to increase the size by one point to make the font more readable. As a result, lines of code tend to run longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wt-offset-top-24&quot;&gt;JetBrains Mono’s standard-width letters help keep lines to the expected length.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New study: The advertising industry is systematically breaking EU law</title>
<link>https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;14. januar, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online advertising industry is behind comprehensive illegal collection and indiscriminate use of personal data, research from the Norwegian Consumer Council shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings, more than 20 consumer and civil society organisations in Europe and from different parts of the world are urging their authorities to investigate the practices of the online advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbrukerradet.no/undersokelse/no-undersokelsekategori/report-out-of-control/&quot;&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt; uncovers how every time we use apps, hundreds of shadowy entities are receiving personal data about our interests, habits, and behaviour. This information is used to profile consumers, which can be used for targeted advertising, but may also lead to discrimination, manipulation and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– These practices are out of control and in breach of European data protection legislation. The extent of tracking makes it impossible for us to make informed choices about how our personal data is collected, shared and used, says Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_28735&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/out-of-control-mobil-650x433-liten-.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-28735&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-28735&quot; src=&quot;https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/out-of-control-mobil-650x433-liten-.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hånd som holder mobiltelefon.foto&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/out-of-control-mobil-650x433-liten-.jpg 650w, https://www.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/out-of-control-mobil-650x433-liten--250x167.jpg 250w, https://www.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/out-of-control-mobil-650x433-liten--120x80.jpg 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Consumer Council is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/&quot;&gt;filing formal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people and companies that were receiving personal data through the app;  Twitter`s MoPub, AT&amp;amp;T’s AppNexus, OpenX, AdColony and Smaato. The complaints are directed to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority for breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The EU’s data protection law is a powerful tool to defend consumers against companies who do not respect their privacy. Consumer groups from across the EU will continue to take action against those who break the rules, says Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Every time you open an app like Grindr advertisement networks get your GPS location, device identifiers and even the fact that you use a gay dating app. This is an insane violation of users’ EU privacy rights, says Max Schrems, founder of the European privacy non-profit NGO &lt;em&gt;noyb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The harmful effects of profiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many actors in the online advertising industry collect information about us from a variety of places, including web browsing, connected devices, and social media. When combined, this data provides a complex picture of individuals, revealing what we do in our daily lives, our secret desires, and our most vulnerable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–  This massive commercial surveillance is systematically at odds with our fundamental rights  and can be used to discriminate, manipulate and exploit us. The widespread tracking also has the potential to seriously degrade consumer trust in digital services, says Myrstad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Furthermore, in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/POL3014042019ENGLISH.PDF&quot;&gt;Amnesty International report&lt;/a&gt;, Amnesty showed how these data-driven business models are a serious threat to human rights such as freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has to be done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Consumer Council urges companies that rely on digital advertising to look towards alternative solutions to the currently domineering online advertising system, such as technologies that do not rely on widespread sharing and collection of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The situation is completely out of control. In order to shift the significant power imbalance between consumers and third party companies, the current practices of extensive tracking and profiling have to end, says Myrstad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– There are very few actions consumers can take to limit or prevent the massive tracking and data sharing that is happening all across the internet. Authorities must take active enforcement measures to protect consumers against the illegal exploitation of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
