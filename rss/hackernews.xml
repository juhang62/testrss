<title>Algorithm allows video editors to modify talking-head videos as if editing text</title>
<link>https://news.stanford.edu/2019/06/05/edit-video-editing-text/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In television and film, actors often flub small bits of otherwise flawless performances. Other times they leave out a critical word. For editors, the only solution so far is to accept the flaws or fix them with expensive reshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;visible-print-inline-block visible-print-styles&quot;&gt;Go to the web site to view the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right pull-right-wide hidden-print&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;media-attrib&quot;&gt;Video by Ohad Fried et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ybLCfVeFL4?feature=oembed&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;A new algorithm makes it possible to perform text-based editing of videos of “talking heads”; that is, speakers from the shoulders up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, however, if that editor could modify video using a text transcript. Much like word processing, the editor could easily add new words, delete unwanted ones or completely rearrange the pieces by dragging and dropping them as needed to assemble a finished video that looks almost flawless to the untrained eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Stanford University, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Princeton University and Adobe Research created such an algorithm for editing talking-head videos – videos showing speakers from the shoulders up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work could be a boon for video editors and producers but does raise concerns as people increasingly question the validity of images and videos online, the authors said. However, they propose some guidelines for using these tools that would alert viewers and performers that the video has been manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, technologies like this will always attract bad actors,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohadf.com/&quot;&gt;Ohad Fried&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford. “But the struggle is worth it given the many creative video editing and content creation applications this enables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading lips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application uses the new transcript to extract speech motions from various video pieces and, using machine learning, convert those into a final video that appears natural to the viewer – lip-synched and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Visually, it’s seamless. There’s no need to rerecord anything,” said Fried, who is first author of a paper about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohadf.com/projects/text-based-editing/&quot;&gt;the research&lt;/a&gt; published on the pre-publication website &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01524&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;. It will also be in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACM Transactions on Graphics&lt;/em&gt;. Fried works in the lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/maneesh-agrawala&quot;&gt;Maneesh Agrawala&lt;/a&gt;, the Forest Baskett Professor in the School of Engineering and senior author of the paper. The project began when Fried was a graduate student working with computer scientist Adam Finkelstein at Princeton, more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should an actor or performer flub a word or misspeak, the editor can simply edit the transcript and the application will assemble the right word from various words or portions of words spoken elsewhere in the video. It’s the equivalent of rewriting with video, much like a writer retypes a misspelled or unfit word. The algorithm does require at least 40 minutes of original video as input, however, so it won’t yet work with just any video sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the transcript is edited, the algorithm selects segments from elsewhere in the recorded video with motion that can be stitched to produce the new material. In their raw form these video segments would have jarring jump cuts and other visual flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the video appear more natural, the algorithm applies intelligent smoothing to the motion parameters and renders a 3D animated version of the desired result. However, that rendered face is still far from realistic. As a final step, a machine learning technique called Neural Rendering converts the low-fidelity digital model into a photorealistic video in perfect lip-synch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the capabilities of their system the researchers performed a series of complex edits including adding, removing and changing words, as well as translations to different languages, and even created full sentences as if from whole cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a crowd-sourced study with 138 participants, the team’s edits were rated as “real” almost 60 percent of the time. The visual quality is such that it is very close to the original, but Fried said there’s plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The implications for movie post-production are big,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~atewari/&quot;&gt;Ayush Tewari&lt;/a&gt;, a student at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and the paper’s second author. It presents for the first time the possibility of fixing filmed dialogue without reshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in an era of synthesized fake videos such capabilities raise important ethical concerns, Fried added. There are very valuable and justifiable reasons to want to edit video in this way, namely the expense and effort required to rerecord or repair such flaws in video content, or to customize existing audio-visual video content by audience. Instructional videos might be fine-tuned to different languages or cultural backgrounds, for instance, or children’s stories could be adapted to different ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This technology is really about better storytelling,” Fried said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fried acknowledges concerns that such a technology might be used for illicit purposes, but says the risk is worth taking. Photo-editing software went through a similar reckoning, but in the end, people want to live in a world where photo-editing software is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a remedy, Fried says there are several options. One is to develop some sort of opt-in watermarking that would identify any content that had been edited and provide a full ledger of the edits. Moreover, researchers could develop better forensics such as digital or non-digital fingerprinting techniques to determine whether a video had been manipulated for ulterior purposes. In fact, this research and others like it also build the essential insights that are needed to develop better manipulation detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the solutions can fix everything, so viewers must remain skeptical and cautious, Fried said. Besides, he added, there are already many other ways to manipulate video that are much easier to execute. He said that perhaps the most pressing matter is to raise public awareness and education on video manipulation, so people are better equipped to question and assess the veracity of synthetic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional co-authors include Michael Zollhöfer, a visiting assistant professor at Stanford, and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Princeton University and Adobe Research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The research was funded by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, the Max Planck Center for Visual Computing and Communications, a European Research Council Consolidator Grant, Adobe Research and the Office of the Dean for Research at Princeton University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The decline of the family has unleashed an epidemic of loneliness</title>
<link>https://www.city-journal.org/decline-of-family-loneliness-epidemic</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.city-journal.org/decline-of-family-loneliness-epidemic</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;mericans are suffering from a bad case of loneliness. The number of people in the United States &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Going-Solo-Extraordinary-Surprising-Appeal/dp/0143122770&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;living alone&lt;/a&gt; has gone through the studio-apartment roof. A study released by the insurance company Cigna last spring made headlines with its announcement: “Only around half of Americans say they have meaningful, daily face-to-face social interactions.” Loneliness, public-health experts tell us, is killing as many people as obesity and smoking. It’s not much comfort that Americans are not, well, alone in this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5359916/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; are lonely, the &lt;em&gt;bon vivant&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.fr/20130626/growing-nuber-of-french-living-solitary-lives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; are lonely, and even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/25/nordic-countries-happy-reputation-masks-sadness-of-young-says-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scandinavians&lt;/a&gt;—the happiest people in the world, according to the UN’s World Happiness Report—are lonely, too. British prime minister Theresa May recently appointed a “Minister of Loneliness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard evidence for a loneliness epidemic admittedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2018/8/all-the-lonely-americans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has some issues&lt;/a&gt;. How is loneliness different from depression? How much do living alone and loneliness overlap? Do social scientists know how to compare today’s misery with that in, say, the mid-twentieth century, a period that produced prominent books like &lt;em&gt;The Lonely Crowd&lt;/em&gt;? Certainly, some voguish explanations for the crisis should raise skepticism: among the recent suspects are favorite villains like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@melissalovestowrite/how-technology-is-increasing-loneliness-in-america-c6dbdbab8f5b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/07/03/25452/#.XDjqdS2ZPBI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genetic bad luck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-wrenching-society-apart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the loneliness thesis taps into a widespread intuition of something true and real and grave. Foundering social trust, collapsing heartland communities, an opioid epidemic, and rising numbers of “deaths of despair” suggest a profound, collective discontent. It’s worth mapping out one major cause that is simultaneously so obvious and so uncomfortable that loneliness observers tend to mention it only in passing. I’m talking, of course, about family breakdown. At this point, the consequences of family volatility are an evergreen topic when it comes to children; this remains the subject of countless papers and conferences. Now, we should take account of how deeply the changes in family life of the past 50-odd years are intertwined with the flagging well-being of so many adults and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;cholars sometimes refer to the domestic earthquake that first rumbled through wealthy countries like the U.S. in the mid-twentieth century as the Second Demographic Transition. (The first transition occurred around the time of the Industrial Revolution, as the high death and birth rates that had been humanity’s default condition since the Neanderthals declined dramatically, leading to rapid population growth.) Mostly associated with the Belgian demographer Ron Lesthaeghe, the SDT (the unfortunately evocative acronym) is a useful framework for understanding the dramatic rupture between the &lt;em&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SDT began emerging in the West after World War II. As societies became richer and goods cheaper and more plentiful, people no longer had to rely on traditional families to afford basic needs like food and shelter. They could look up the Maslovian ladder toward “post-material” goods: self-fulfillment, exotic and erotic experiences, expressive work, education. Values changed to facilitate these goals. People in wealthy countries became more antiauthoritarian, more critical of traditional rules and roles, and more dedicated to individual expression and choice. With the help of the birth-control pill, “non-conventional household formation” (divorce, remarriage, cohabitation, and single parenthood) went from uncommon—for some, even shameful—to mundane. Lesthaeghe predicted that low fertility would also be part of the SDT package, as families grew less central. And low fertility, he suggested, would have thorny repercussions for nation-states: he was one of the first to guess that developed countries would turn to immigrants to restock their aging populations, as native-born young adults found more fulfilling things to do than clean up after babies or cook dinner for sullen adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disruption of family life caused by the SDT in the U.S. has been rehearsed thousands of times, including by this writer, but the numbers still startle. In 1950, 20 percent of marriages ended in divorce; today, it’s approximately 40 percent. Four in ten American children are now born to unmarried mothers, up from about 5 percent in 1960. In 1970, 84 percent of U.S. children spent their entire childhoods living with both bio-parents. Today, only half can expect to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesthaeghe was prophetic about what would happen to fertility in wealthy countries. In the U.S., the percentage of childless women doubled between 1970 and the mid-2000s; today, 14 percent of U.S. women past their childbearing years have never given birth. That actually makes us more fertile than some other developed countries. In Germany, nearly a quarter of women end up childless. The U.S. number might more closely resemble the German figure if it weren’t for our high levels of immigration, most of it from poor countries that haven’t yet embraced the change in attitudes. In 2015, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/29/over-the-past-25-years-immigrant-moms-bolstered-births-in-48-states/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;six U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 percent of births were to foreign-born women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postwar baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, were Generation Zero for the Second Demographic Transition in the United States. Now shuffling their way into their sixties and seventies, older boomers give a glimpse of the long-term downside of the post-SDT culture. If we had to pick just one word to describe it, “lonely” would do. In widely quoted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/09/26/1710341114.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, Ashton M. Verdery and Rachel Margolis uncovered a recent surge in the number of “kinless” older adults. Lower fertility translates into fewer siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins, whether for hospital visits or emergency contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jump in the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/record-share-of-americans-have-never-married/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;never-married&lt;/a&gt; and divorced adults is also part of the kinlessness story. Boomers were the first generation to divorce in large numbers, and they continue to split up even as they amble into their golden years, giving rise to the phenomenon known as “gray divorce.” The divorce rate has doubled for people over 50 since 1990. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/222a1636-e668-4893-b082-418a100fd93d/robert-putnam-testimony.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 Senate testimony&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Putnam, author of the 2000 milestone &lt;em&gt;Bowling Alone&lt;/em&gt; and the national prophet of social-capital decline, cautioned that for all these reasons, boomers will face a more lonesome old age than their Greatest Generation parents. “[R]oughly 12 percent fewer of the mid-boomer birth cohort of 1955 will be living with spouses when they reach age 65 than was true of the birth cohort of 1930,” he observed. Those boomers will also have 36 percent fewer children than the earlier cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divorce has frayed ties between boomers and the children that they do have. Divorced fathers tend to stay close to their children in the months and years immediately following separation, but for various reasons they often drift away over time. And the younger the child at the time of the breakup, the less likely it is that fathers will continue to be involved. “Waiting till the kids have moved out,” as the gray-divorce boomlet suggests that lots of couples are doing, is not as strong protection from a kin deficit as one might expect. Gray divorce damages parents’ relationships with their adult children, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divorce didn’t turn boomers off to marriage entirely; a substantial number plunged in again. But instead of replacing defunct relationships, remarriage further fragmented family ties. For one thing, when parents remarry, it often brings jealousies, bad chemistry, and resentments into their relationships with their children. That’s especially true when a parent starts a second family with a new spouse. Given the overscheduling of contemporary childhood, not to mention the emotions provoked by ex-spouses, it’s inevitable that fathers who remarry or whose ex-wives remarry become an afterthought to, or an irritating intrusion into, their children’s daily family routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason remarriage frequently fails to replenish kin networks is that second marriages are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/acs/acs-30.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even more likely to break up than first&lt;/a&gt;—and third unions are flimsier still. Divorced people generally can’t count on ex-wives or husbands to provide much companionship or support when they have a heart attack or a close friend dies. Studies also show—unsurprisingly—that stepchildren don’t care for needy stepparents as much as they do their biological parents; that’s especially true in gray remarriages, when kids are likely to be older when a stepparent enters the picture. As Verdery and Margolis sum up: “Evidence is accumulating that the legacy of divorce and remarriage has a long reach straining inter-generational relationships and suppressing the support that divorced parents, stepparents, and remarried biological parents might expect from their children in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors don’t mention cohabitation, but it’s a key ingredient in the rise of kinlessness. Superficially, cohabitation looks roughly equivalent to marriage; couples live together as “husband and wife,” sharing a bed, living space, meals, and, in many cases, children, but without the ring and city-hall certificate. In reality, especially in the U.S., shacking up is a kind of marriage-lite that has added to the tenuousness of post-transition relations. Cohabiting couples break up faster and more often than marrieds. Separated, cohabiting fathers are more likely to withdraw from their kids’ lives than previously married and divorced dads, who are already more unreliable than married dads still in the house. One study of low-income cohabiting parents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858317/)/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that, within three years, half the fathers had moved out; a considerable number would vanish from their kids’ lives entirely. Cohabiting and single parents also have looser ties to their own parents and friends than marrieds. According to the 2018 Cigna study, single parents are about the loneliest of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n translating family formation into a strictly private matter, the SDT whistled past a critical fact of our history—namely, that kinship has been the most powerful glue of human groups since Homo sapiens first discovered the mother-in-law. Evolutionary psychologists have a compelling theory about why: humans practiced “reciprocal altruism” in relation to kin because they had a stake in the reproductive success of their genetic relations. Even evolutionary-psychology skeptics, though, might notice that though marriage has shape-shifted over the centuries and across cultures, it has always defined those people—spouses, parents, children, grandparents, siblings, in-laws—to whom we owe special attention and mutual protection. That would explain why cohabiting couples, even those with children, don’t have the same support from extended family as married couples with children. Marriage creates kin; cohabitation does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most crucial obligations of kinship have always been to tend to the sick and to bury the dead. Even today, the vast majority of (unpaid) caretaking of the aging in the U.S. is done by relatives, according to Putnam. In 2015, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Magazine&lt;/em&gt; published a memorable article, “The Lonely Death of George Bell,” that captures the existential plight of the kinless. The subject was a 74-year-old Queens man whose body was discovered by police after neighbors complained about the foul odor coming from his apartment. His badly decomposed body left him unrecognizable, but even had he been found earlier, only one or two people on earth could have ID’d him. George Bell had no brothers or sisters, his parents were both long dead, he had no children, and he had never married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kinless elderly are often hoarders who hang on to every stray electric bill, used coffee cup, or odd bit of broken furniture that enters their apartment; perhaps the chaos of useless objects is the objective correlative of their sense of abandonment. The article describes one woman whose apartment was “so swollen with belongings that [she] died standing up, unable to collapse to the floor.” Bell’s own stash, which took seven hours to clear out, included four new tire gauges and six unopened ironing-board covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinless elderly are often hoarders who hang on to every stray electric bill, used coffee cup, or odd bit of broken furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A death like Bell’s mobilizes an impressive cadre of officials in addition to junk removers and cleaners: a medical examiner, who calls local doctors and hospitals to see if anyone has records for the deceased; a medical legal investigator to rule out foul play; police detectives to track down close relatives or friends by calling phone numbers found in papers strewn around the apartment, and, when that fails, a “decedent property agent,” who disposes of unclaimed property; a “kinship investigator,” required by law to find next of kin down to first cousin once removed; and employees of both the city-chosen funeral home and crematory. After creating a family tree, the investigator learned of several cousins scattered around the country and abroad; as it happened, they were themselves dead, or couldn’t be reached, or said that they hadn’t spoken to Bell in decades. Investigators found a will with four legatees, including a long-ago girlfriend. She was notified about the bequest but died before she received it, which meant that the money—mostly from the sale of Bell’s apartment—went to her own legatees, who had never met or even heard of him. N. R. Kleinfield, who wrote the piteous story, pieced together some details of Bell’s life, one of which was full of tragic irony, given the anonymous isolation of his demise: he had fed and bathed his mother, who had severe arthritis in her old age, until her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a fuller picture of the brave new kinless world, consider Japan, a country now in the throes of an epidemic of &lt;em&gt;kodokushi&lt;/em&gt;, roughly translated as “lonely deaths.” Local Japanese papers regularly publish stories about kinless elderly whose deaths go unnoticed until the telltale smell of maggot-eaten flesh alerts neighbors. Such deaths are common enough that Japanese entrepreneurs have created an industry of cleaning companies for dealing with their aftereffects. Last year, a reporter watched as workers clad in full-body protective gear from one of those companies—with the chilling name “Next”—disinfected the apartment of Hiroaki, a 54-year-old divorced man with no children. No one noticed that he had been gone for four months, and even then, it was only because Hiroaki’s rent money, which had been automatically deducted from a savings account, had dried up. A representative of the building’s management company finally discovered his decomposed remains on a soiled futon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lonely-death cleaning companies promise to be a good investment in Japan. The culture’s legendary filial piety has gone the way of the samurai; children and grandchildren are often too busy or far away for regular visiting. And that’s for the lucky ones who have progeny. A record number of young people are forgoing marriage, just as they are in the United States. But unlike other post-transition countries, Japan is not replacing marriage with “nonconventional” family arrangements. Divorce, nonmarital births, single parents, and cohabitation remain rare. (Oddly, even sex appears to be losing its appeal for young Japanese men and women.) The country’s fertility rate is about the lowest in the world, and despite Prime Minister Shinzo¯ Abe’s support for parental leave, tax incentives, and various other measures designed to increase births, there’s no sign of public enthusiasm for marriage and baby-making. “The general concept of family in Japan has fallen apart,” as Masaki Ichinose, of the Centre for Life and Death Studies at the University of Tokyo, told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FLORIAN GAERTNER/PHOTOTHEK/GETTY IMAGES&quot; title=&quot;FLORIAN GAERTNER/PHOTOTHEK/GETTY IMAGES&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;645&quot; class=&quot;media-element file-default&quot; data-delta=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/sites/cj/files/loneliness-epidemic.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;ne way to respond to lonely deaths is with an existential shrug. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men,” Pascal wrote. “Wretched as we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.” Loneliness is as much a part of the human condition as joy, you could argue, and, at any rate, it is a price we should be willing to pay for freedom from dictatorial patriarchal rule. The Second Demographic Transition offered relief from many of life’s most palpable miseries: hectoring or depressed wives, abusive or sullen or just hapless husbands, controlling relatives, and taboos on premarital and gay sex. It expanded emotional and psychological horizons and attachments to new people, places, and experiences, and gave us permission to explore myriad ways to eat, pray, and love. How many would choose to sacrifice those freedoms—even if doing so could guarantee a crowded funeral?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard-nosed realists could also correctly point out that over-romanticizing family bonds has its own risks. People can feel lonely and despairing amid a boisterous family Thanksgiving dinner. If family members inspire our most intense love, they can also provoke the most rage and frustration. And let’s not forget that many people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to live alone. Researching &lt;em&gt;Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone&lt;/em&gt;, sociologist Eric Klinenberg was surprised to hear from most of his elderly subjects, especially women, that they preferred living by themselves to the available alternatives, including living with their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet these benefits shouldn’t prevent a clear-eyed accounting of other blowback from the Second Demographic Transition that goes beyond lonely deaths. The transition helped shape a social ecology that would worsen some of our most vexing social problems, including growing inequality. Throughout the Western world, wealthier, more educated parents tend more often to be married before they have children, and to stay married, than do their less advantaged fellow citizens. Their children benefit not just from their parents’ financial advantages, with all the computer camps and dance lessons that a flush checking account can buy, but from the familiar routines and predictable households that seem to help the young figure out the complex world they’ll be entering. The children of lower-income, less educated parents, by contrast, are more likely to see their married parents divorce or their cohabiting parents separate, and then to have to readjust to the strangers—stepparents, boyfriends or girlfriends, step- or half-siblings—who come into their lives. Some children will be introduced to a succession of newcomers as their parents divorce or separate a second or even third time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, after the transition, did the rich continue to have reasonably stable and predictable domestic lives while the working class and poor stumbled onto what family scholar Andrew Cherlin calls the “marriage-go-round”? Observers typically point to deindustrialization and the loss of stable, decent-paying low-skilled jobs for men. True enough. A jobless man, especially one without a high school diploma, is no one’s idea of a good catch. But there’s more to the marriage gap than that. While the loosening of traditional rules gave women freedom to leave violent or cruel husbands, it also changed the cultural environment for couples trying to weather less dangerous stresses and disappointments, including a pink slip. Lower-income men and women are bound to have more financial anxieties, more work accidents, and more broken-down cars and evictions, and they lack the funds for Disneyland vacations, massages, and psychotherapists that might take some of the edge off a struggling marriage. And they see few, if any, long-term married couples who could offer a successful model. With single parenthood and cohabitation both on the lifestyle menu, what they see instead is an easy out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When so many marriages melt into thin air, lower-income kin networks, a source of job connections, child care, and family meals, attenuate as well. Your mother’s sister’s husband—your uncle by marriage—might give you a tip about a job opening at a local machine shop; an uncle separated from your aunt and living with a girlfriend with her own kids in the next town over, maybe not. Communities flush with fatherless households tend to be troubled. In his landmark study of county-level social mobility, economist Raj Chetty discovered that places thick with married-couple families created more opportunity for kids, regardless of whether they were living in a married or single-parent household; places with large numbers of single-parent homes, on the other hand, pulled kids down—including those living with married parents. It’s hard to imagine more concrete evidence of the truth of the old cliché that family is the building block of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial inequality predates the transition, of course, but with their families and communities already weakened by slavery, racism, and clumsy government policies, black Americans were hit hard. Verdery and Margolis believe that blacks are at especially high risk of kinlessness as they age. Black women are two times as likely as whites to have never married by age 45, and two times as likely to be divorced, widowed, or separated. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to unmarried mothers. Black nonresidential fathers tend to see their kids more than do white men living apart from their offspring in the early months and years of the child’s life; but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858317/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over time&lt;/a&gt;, they fade out of the picture. An oncologist of my acquaintance working at an inner-city hospital tells me that he sees a remarkable number of black men arriving at the clinic for treatment by themselves. If they get hospitalized, visitors are sparse; as they near death, still no one comes. “My poor mother, like many other slave-women, had many children, but no family,” Frederick Douglass once wrote. Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/42/11109&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;black men&lt;/a&gt; could now say something similar about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family instability and fatherlessness collide with racial and economic disadvantage to create a negative feedback loop in black communities, hampering children’s potential and perpetuating racial inequality. Black children are by far the least likely of any demographic group to go through childhood living with both parents. Considering that kids from single-parent homes, black and white, have less chance of completing high school and college and a greater chance of becoming single parents themselves, the current calculus of inequality will endure. A just-published study by demographer John Iceland concludes that differences in family structure are the most significant variable in explaining the black–white affluence gap. In fact, its importance has grown over time relative to other explanations, including discrimination. Unable to pool earnings with a spouse, to take advantage of economies of scale, and to share child care, black single parents have a tougher time than their married counterparts building a nest egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent decades, the transition has eroded the God-fearing, “middle American” white working-class family, too—and their communities. &lt;a href=&quot;http://opportunityamericaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WCG-final_web.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;As of 1980&lt;/a&gt;, about 75 percent of white working-class adults were married, a figure very close to the 79 percent of high-income adults. By 2017, however, the working-class number had fallen to only 52 percent. Worse, white working-class adults divorce at much higher rates than more educated adults. “The white working-class family is today more fragile than the black family was at the time of the famous alarm-sounding 1965 ‘Report on the Negro Family’ by Daniel Patrick Moynihan,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/222a1636-e668-4893-b082-418a100fd93d/robert-putnam-testimony.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Putnam has written&lt;/a&gt;. J. D. Vance’s best-selling &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/em&gt; evokes that fragility: his parents divorced when he was little, and his father disappeared from his life until he was a teenager; a series of his mother’s boyfriends and husbands cycled through J. D.’s childhood; his maternal grandmother fought constantly with her drunken husband, once dousing him with gasoline and setting him on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crumbling of the white working-class family has contributed to the country’s opioid crisis. Opioids are now the leading cause of death for people under 50: a majority of them are unmarried or divorced men. Though only 32 percent of the population, that group of adults accounts for a stunning 71 percent of opioid deaths. Opioids themselves, now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/15/americans-more-likely-to-die-from-opioid-overdose-than-car-accident.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;larger cause of American deaths than car accidents&lt;/a&gt;, are poisoning the foundational kinship bond between parents and children. Officials believe that opioids are at the root of a heartrending increase in foster-care placements. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/children-ohio-opioid-epidemic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fourteen states&lt;/a&gt; experienced a 25 percent rise or more in the number of kids sent to foster care between 2011 and 2015; Maine saw a 45 percent increase in that same period. Can it be a coincidence that the drug dominating today’s headlines provokes a similar response in the brain as the hormone oxytocin does? Oxytocin, sometimes called the “love hormone,” occurs naturally at moments of intense love and connection: during childbirth, breastfeeding, and orgasm. Opioids, Andrew Sullivan wrote in a powerful essay on the epidemic in &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;, have given the lonely a “shortcut—and an instant intensification—of the happiness [they] might ordinarily experience in a good and fruitful communal life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, there is family breakdown’s role in the “deaths of despair,” as economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton call the exploding number of deaths by suicide, alcohol abuse, and drug overdose. Case and Deaton shocked demographers and policymakers several years ago when they published findings showing that the increase was enough to reverse the long-term trend toward longer, healthier lives, one of the proudest signs of human progress. In the first decades of the twenty-first century, suicide suddenly surged for both white men and white women. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Case and Deaton found&lt;/a&gt; these deaths especially common among people with only high school or less education and among separated, divorced, and widowed (though not single) men. Public-health researchers have known for a long time that unmarried men and women are at higher risk of early death from a variety of diseases. One spouse might find a suspicious-looking mole on the other’s back or notice if she’s drinking more than her usual. And who hasn’t heard accounts of relatives stopping harried nurses from giving patients the wrong medication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that men are more likely to die from opioid overdoses and other deaths of despair. Men seem to have a harder time coping with isolation and family breakdown than women. Most of the lonely deaths in Japan are men. Fathers continue to have more tenuous relations with their children than mothers do, despite growing cultural preference for gender-equal child care. A 2016 report from the University of Michigan Population Studies Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/abs/10543&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that an extraordinary 20 percent of young adults in the U.S. have absolutely no contact with their fathers (not including those who have died), far higher than the 6.5 percent who no longer talked to their mothers. Women initiate more divorces, and when the papers are signed, according to a Pew survey, they are more likely to swear off marriage for good; men tend to want to remarry. In &lt;em&gt;Going Solo&lt;/em&gt;, Klinenberg discovered that women are far more adept at creating their own social networks, going out with groups of friends, volunteering at local charities, and the like. Single women will purchase a home more often than do single men. Even after the SDT, women are the more intuitive homemakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;urn the place completely upside-down, inside-out, and you still won’t find a solution to kinlessness, social isolation, and their tragic fallout in the office of a Minister of Loneliness. Government can fund services for the isolated and frail elderly. Many American cities have neighborhood senior centers with help desks and activities to keep the aged active and socially connected. Civil society has also jumped in, with groups like Meals on Wheels and Seniors Helping Seniors. Churches and other religious institutions help keep an eye on elderly congregants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts are undeniably beneficial; sometimes, they save lives. But when you consider the more damaging systemic changes wrought by the transition, they are little more than aspirin for a gaping wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there’s no going back to a time when people had little freedom to pursue personal life on their own terms, there are reasons to think that some healing is possible. The transition put unprecedented personal autonomy up for sale, but as it happened, relatively few were interested in buying the whole package. An innate human desire for elemental familial bonds continued to assert itself. In surveys, Americans today describe family relations as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/30/members-of-both-parties-find-meaning-in-family-but-differ-when-it-comes-to-faith/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most meaningful&lt;/a&gt; part of their lives, far surpassing work and friends. Post-transition Europeans are no less sold on family as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major source of meaning&lt;/a&gt; in life. As they reach middle age, most Americans remain heavily involved in supporting and advising elderly parents. American women continue to report a relatively high number of desired children. You’ve heard about—or maybe logged onto—Ancestry.com? It’s not some soon-to-be-forgotten fad like Candy Crush to feed short attention spans. Instead, it’s tapping into a deep desire to discover family roots that connect us to a place, a collective story, and a corner of history. “Uprootedness uproots everything except the need for roots,” as Christopher Lasch once wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to find ways to communicate that need to coming generations before they make decisions that will further fragment their lives and communities. So far, that’s not happening. Millennials and their younger brothers and sisters say that they would like to marry and have children, but only 30 percent see a successful marriage as one of the more important things in life. About half shrug off single parenthood as a nonissue; in their view, cohabitation is fundamentally the same as marriage. Though the overall share of American babies born to unmarried mothers has declined a bit in the past few years, the majority of births to millennials are to unmarried women. So far, younger kids—Gen Z, as they are sometimes called—don’t look as though they’re ready to rebel from the nonchalance of their older siblings. In a 2018 survey of attitudes of 10- to 19-year-olds by PerryUndem Research and Communication, three-quarters rated having a successful career as “very important.” Fewer than a third said that marrying or having children mattered that much. Notably, boys and girls had almost identical answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t surprise me. My boomer acquaintances, college-educated professionals and devoted parents, nudged and prodded their kids from elementary school through college and beyond to prepare for the Big Career. When it came to that other crucial life goal—finding a loyal, loving spouse, a devoted mother or father for their children—their lips were sealed. Such traditional aspirations would have seemed an imposition on their children’s authentic desires rather than a piece of learned wisdom. Yet learn it they had: they danced euphorically at their children’s weddings and are now putting dinner companions to sleep rattling on about the grandkids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, this studied cultural silence about marriage, children, and kinship hasn’t damaged the prospects for my peers’ kids to create and sustain bonds so essential to individual and social well-being. They see these relationships all around them; they’re part of the air they breathe. That’s far from the case in less advantaged communities, where the most elemental bonds are fraying like a piece of 100-year-old muslin. Most policy discussions about the troubles of the American working class and poor center on vocational and technical education, higher-paying and reliable jobs, and benefits. These are necessary efforts, but they are not enough to counter the loneliness, kinlessness, and despair crushing so many spirits. There also must be what Tom Wolfe called a “Great Re-learning” about how to satisfy the human longing for continuity and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just for the sake of the children.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the “Digital Ocean killed my company” incident scares the hell out of me</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.checklyhq.com/why-the-recent-digital-ocean-killed-my-company-incident-scares-the-hell-out-of-me/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;update 05-06-19: Digital Ocean has posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.digitalocean.com/an-update-on-last-weeks-customer-shutdown-incident/&quot;&gt;their postmortem on this situation&lt;/a&gt; as mentioned by their CTO Barry Cooks in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Friday May 31, Nicolas Beauvais, CTO and only tech person of small startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://raisup.com/en&quot;&gt;raisup.com&lt;/a&gt;, took to Twitter with a cry for help. Their cloud hosting company Digital Ocean had just locked their account and made it clear that this was permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;3.7546012269939&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/digitalocean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; just killed our company &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raisupcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@raisupcom&lt;/a&gt;. A long thread for a very sad story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uOFCDRoYJ6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uOFCDRoYJ6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Nicolas Beauvais (@w3Nicolas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/w3Nicolas/status/1134529316904153089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO claimed that RaiseUp had broken the terms of usage. I do not have all the details, so &lt;em&gt;caveat lector&lt;/em&gt;, but apparently it was due to spinning up a dozen droplets and running a batch job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the story got a ton of coverage on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20064169&quot;&gt;Hacker news&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter. People swore to abandon Digital  Ocean — &quot;never again!&quot;; the CTO jumped in; meal mouthed excuses were made etc. etc. You get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account was apparently restored reasonably quickly and the angry mob dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-nicolas&quot;&gt;I am Nicolas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am Nicolas. Sort of. Not with the same impact and gravity of a Charlie Hebdo, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Je suis Charlie&quot;&lt;/em&gt; association, but not dissimilar in spirit. I feel almost personally hit by this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I run a small company, by myself. For now at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use big cloud providers like AWS and Heroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have customers (some quite big actually) that rely on my service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually ran a dozen Digital Ocean droplets with fairly high resource usage before switching to AWS completely some months ago...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I'm scared I could be hit by an out-of-control abuse algorithm and a broken customer service process. And I have zero Twitter clout or any other online notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Checkly prepared for outages and failover? Yes, it actually is. We do regular backups, we can switch from EU based to US based hosting. We can deploy to new regions super quickly. Heck, 90% of our monitoring infrastructure is permanently distributed over the whole globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would this survive when AWS and Heroku decide to unequivocally shut us down? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at both sides of the argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-didn-t-you-just-&quot;&gt;Why didn't you just...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did Nicolas do wrong here? Luckily we have the friendly crowds on Twitter and Hacker news to tell us. Here is some wisdom from the various threads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why were you only hosting one JUST ONE cloud provider?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why didn't you have backups outside of JUST ONE cloud provider?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why didn't you have a monthly validated Disaster Recovery plan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did you use Digital Ocean in the first place?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why isn't everyone on bare metal?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why didn't you use React in Docker?&lt;/em&gt; (this one I made up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly fair questions, right? But as someone in the Twitter thread said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;its good advice bt im Not sure uve had a startup before.&quot; [sic]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can't just shrug off basic service reliability and availability planning just because you're a (small) startup. Consequently, that is &lt;strong&gt;the whole reason you are using a cloud service like Digital Ocean.&lt;/strong&gt; Or any cloud service in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your shitty, self hosted, never patched, not-monitored infrastructure is almost never better than a modern cloud provider. Money wise and time wise. Multiply that statement by ten if you are a bootstrapped, indie hacker, maker, solo-dev whatever startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also goes for offsite backups and DR scenarios. Your cloud provider is 9 out 10 times better equipped to offer you the tools to implement this on their redundant, geographically distributed data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll even make the counter argument. Small startups &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get some slack with regard to typical Enterprise™ services. They are innovative, quick to act, mostly cheap and eager to please early customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth something and Fortune 500 companies doing business with small startups know this. The risk factor is higher, but probably more due to the company folding because of typical startup reasons —money, fights, egos, fatigue — than because of infrastructure lock-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also &quot;doing business with a Fortune 500 company&quot; most of the time means a team inside that Fortune 500 is using your service or tool for the team's purpose. General Electric does not run on your bootstrapped stamp collecting SaaS, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did Nicolas screw up by having all his eggs in one basket? No. He's in a two person startup. This is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-only-have-to-be-wrong-once&quot;&gt;You only have to be wrong once&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling abuse is hard and very annoying. I do not claim to have any experience at the scale Digital Ocean is operating at, but I do have to cancel/ban accounts once in a while when some crypto farmer tries to abuse Checkly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not surprise me at all that DO has automated large parts of their &quot;abuse pipeline&quot;. It also does not surprise me at all that they have a &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; policy and that they enforce this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem is similar to what you often hear in discussions around terrorism and counter-terrorism: &quot;the terrorists only have to get it right once, where counter terrorism has to get it right 100% of the time&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not calling anyone here a terrorist, but the example stands. Your abuse algorithm has to be REALLY good and it needs to be followed up by some REALLY good human investigation to double check the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, it's a combination of factors that cause the accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; failed, based on what I can gather, to recognize some scaling operation as normal, legitimate usage. Again, I assume it was legitimate. Something was set too tight. Or not tight enough and it triggers too many false positives making triage hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;human&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; failed, probably because of bureaucracy. Maybe because of stress, poor training, company culture, you name it. They failed to recognize Nicolas' business as just a normal customer. They probably didn't even check their website or customer history. This is all speculation of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the combination of these two categories of failure that scare me. Even more when there is a &quot;no recourse&quot; policy and I'm a social media nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigations&quot;&gt;Mitigations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I going to do about this? What can fellow small startups do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be upfront and honest with your customers about your operation. Don't create false expectations. They are probably fine with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't go all DRS / failover crazy. You're probably solving the wrong problem for your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get comfortable with the support crew at your cloud provider. Maybe hit up engineers or support on LinkedIn or Twitter to establish some rapport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay for that extra support tier, if possible. Note, this can get crazy expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish some form of &quot;clout&quot;, just in case you need a Twitter mob to wake up C-Level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do have some backups outside of your primary cloud provider. You'll sleep better.&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>Why the &quot;Digital Ocean killed my company&quot; incident scares me</og:title>
<og:description>Digital Ocean recently locked out a small startup. I'm scared I could be hit by a faulty abuse algorithm and a broken customer service process too.</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;Modified: 06 Jun 2019 14:31 UTC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joyent Public Cloud (Triton Cloud) will reach End-of-Life (EOL) on November 9, 2019. The Joyent Public Cloud / Triton Cloud, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.joyent.com&quot;&gt;my.joyent.com&lt;/a&gt; user login and customer-facing APIs, will no longer accept new customers as of June 6, 2019, and will discontinue serving existing customers upon EOL on November 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triton-enabled cloud technology remains a core focus of Joyent's offerings, and we continue to build functionality for our open source Triton offering complemented by commercial support options to utilize Triton equivalent private clouds in a single-tenant model. These options are available to customers by way of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joyent.com/triton/managed-private-cloud&quot;&gt;Fully-Managed Private Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joyent.com/triton/managed-hardware-cloud&quot;&gt;Managed Hardware Private Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joyent.com/triton/on-premise&quot;&gt;On-Premise Private Cloud&lt;/a&gt; support options. If you wish to evaluate whether these single-tenant options make sense for your use cases, you are welcome to request a consultation or pricing information by contacting &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@joyent.com&quot;&gt;support@joyent.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sales@joyent.com&quot;&gt;sales@joyent.com&lt;/a&gt; or using your existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.joyent.com&quot;&gt;help.joyent.com&lt;/a&gt; support account login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers who intend to find alternative cloud providers to power their Joyent Public Cloud environments, we will provide ongoing assistance (on or before November 9, 2019) to ensure a smooth transition and migration. To request assistance, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@joyent.com&quot;&gt;support@joyent.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sales@joyent.com&quot;&gt;sales@joyent.com&lt;/a&gt;, or use your existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.joyent.com&quot;&gt;help.joyent.com&lt;/a&gt; support login.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Medium Sucks</title>
<link>https://www.cdevn.com/why-medium-actually-sucks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cdevn.com/why-medium-actually-sucks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple weeks, there's been a lot of backlash against Medium in response to the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018834314-Stories-that-are-part-of-the-metered-paywall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Paywall&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I started seeing a lot of tweets similar to this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7.7327586206897&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm sure this blog post is excellent, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Medium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Medium&lt;/a&gt;'s paywall is preventing me from reading it. Proliferating paywalls on blog articles is an unpleasant future. It feels like inviting academic paywalls back into the tech world. Let's start avoiding paywalled services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Medium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Medium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rVW4YSrFZp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/rVW4YSrFZp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Bharath Ramsundar (@rbhar90) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rbhar90/status/1129865769255182336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 18, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have two major problems with this attitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason-1-authors-put-up-the-paywall-not-medium&quot;&gt;Reason 1: &lt;strong&gt;Authors Put Up the Paywall, Not Medium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've run into paywalled content, it means that the author of that specific piece of content opted-in to the paywall. By default, the paywall is disabled. Once you've written a post you're presented with the below dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20fill='none'%20viewBox='0%200%201424%20248'%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter%20id='__svg-blur-0'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur%20in='SourceGraphic'%20stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage%20x='0'%20y='0'%20filter='url(%23__svg-blur-0)'%20width='1424'%20height='248'%20xlink:href='data:image/png%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAALCAYAAADP9otxAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABnElEQVRIx%2bVWi4rCMBD0/7/LKoJaqVoUbKsU3/WFgn26d7OwJWrKndKDHi4MmU03aTLZbVNLkoSANE1J%2bCehRt8mmy9DBMxRVTyuE1a73W7ckWUZgYuBC8TXtWrs47gqAfsTA8ee0Z8LIJlwvV5zQeBLMHgcx8wlBkCfqnCV7Xw%2bUxiGzLUC7Pd7chyHZrMZ%2bb7PWK1W5Hkerddrcl2Xlssl%2b4vFgubzOXOM6ff7tNlsnrJE1Fdb4QL1ZHQoIwNgWB9EKBQgiqK71H7FpKbUsvitqSIU2bvrKipZrQA4%2bUajQdPplCzLYoxGI/bH4zE1m01qtVocg2xAH05%2bOBySbdtkmibHggPtdpszpNfrMUfb7XZ5HFr4nU6H55B31%2bt1ng/xhmFwnAhUhgjCC78Bx%2bOREQQB7XY7xul0YiDtURZ4Dv9wOHC73W65VFBCSDHgcrnwWHD0I/3gg2NuzIVW0hKlBUEgHEoKIg0GA5pMJncClFUOTwK8q%2b5/tVwA9R7wE/DFlz%2bB7tkr94XHeJlbh7%2b4AOX3AN1//xMg9gVm4cXcbj/m%2bQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='%20/%3e%3c/svg%3e&quot; width=&quot;1424&quot; alt=&quot;maxwidth&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/static/paywalloption.82a2fbd.f4c2583.png 480w, /assets/static/paywalloption.cbab2cf.f4c2583.png 1024w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/static/paywalloption.cbab2cf.f4c2583.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the author decides to opt-in for the paywall they can still obtain a paywall-less link to distribute at their discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason-2-there-are-much-better-reasons-to-dislike-medium&quot;&gt;Reason 2: There are much better reasons to dislike Medium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;slimy-business-tactics&quot;&gt;Slimy Business Tactics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; is a charity that provides free resources for developers. Their mission statement says it best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission: to help people learn to code for free. We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, an email written by FreeCodeCamp founder, was leaked on twitter. The email explains how Medium strong-armed the non-profit, eventually causing them to leave the platform. Specifically he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freeCodeCamp is the biggest publication on Medium. Our open source community sends Medium about 5% of their total traffic. But over the past year, Medium has become more aggressive toward us. They have pressured us to put our articles behind their paywalls. We refused. So they tried to buy us (Which makes no sense. We're a public charity.). We refused. Then they started threatening us with a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming what they are saying is true, Medium quite literally extorted a charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just us. They are doing this to a lot of publications. And a lot of high profile people from the developer community are leaving Medium as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear others speak out as FreeCodeCamp inadvertently did. Here's the email in it's entirety, there are a lot more goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215194537-Format-text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;official Medium documentation&lt;/a&gt;! How they can seriously suggest going to a 3rd party for something simple like syntax highlighting, is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another great example. Medium has a product that is supposed to make it easy to send Newsletters. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/inside-blogging/writing-newsletters-on-medium-sucks-d08405f11a44&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vico Biscotti says in his article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have added a picture or a better logo, but, honestly, my will slipped out of my mind as soon as I saw that the best I could do was adding a full-width picture. Nothing else. You cannot even add a separator, except the default in the footer, or embed a story with its picture, subtitle, and author. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nothingness made newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, nobody at Medium has worked on that tool in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other critical issues with the editing experience include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium doesn't limit bad UX to the editor. For the last year or two, more and more crap has snuck its way into the reading experience too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user experience is so awful, that someone had to make the browser plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-medium-readable-agai/kljjfejkagofbgklifblndjelgabcmig?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Make Medium Readable again&quot;&lt;/a&gt; just to make the experience bearable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-control-of-your-content&quot;&gt;Limited Control of YOUR Content&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium does not surface mechanisms that let you control YOUR content. Take setting a canonical URL as an example. It appears that Medium does not provide a way to set a canonical URL via the menu on your post (pictured below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed I was just missing something. A quick Google search resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/217991468-SEO-and-duplicate-content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;promising page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium’s official tools for cross-posting (including the Migration tool, Import tool, and Wordpress plugin) add the source it is importing from as the canonical link automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first option suggested, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/218445047-Import-Wordpress-archive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Migration tool&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, has been deprecated. The second option, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Import tool&quot;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't work for my blog. For those wondering why the import tool doesn't work for my blog, here's what Medium has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, incredibly insightful. The last suggestion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdevn.com/why-medium-actually-sucks/&quot;&gt;&quot;Wordpress plugin&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is obviously a non-option, as my blog does not use Wordpress or a CMS at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most would have given up at this point, but I'm a bit of masochist. After some more googling, I learn that Medium has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213480768-Publishing-API&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;publishing API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium offers a write-only API free of charge to developers, to enable your applications' users to participate in the Medium network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium uses OAuth2 for authentication, through which you can seamlessly publish to your users’ Medium profiles. The API supports Markdown and HTML content formats, canonical URLs for cross-posting, and the full range of licenses available on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds great right? As I start reading some articles about the publishing API, they keep referring to a &quot;clientID&quot; which is allegedly on my Medium profile. It was not. After some serious frustration, I broke down and went to the Medium API on Github. After a short scroll, I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#21-browser-based-authentication&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Browser-based authentication&lt;/a&gt; section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you must request access by emailing yourfriends@medium.com. Then we will then grant you access to a clientId and a clientSecret on your settings page with which you may access Medium’s API. Each integration should have its own clientId and clientSecret. The clientSecret should be treated like a password and stored securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, every other resource and doc they have, fails to mention this incredibly manual step. But I'm still not defeated, I assumed the email is controlled by a bot which validates your identity on Medium and automatically replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over a day later, I verified that it's most likely just some guy named Jonas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the only one who has had issues with this aspect of Medium. I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/blog/medium-back-to-blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this great article about leaving Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;What Can We Do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating your own blog is easier than ever. If it's been a while since you last made a blog, I highly recommend checking out static site generators such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gridsome&lt;/a&gt;. In conjunction with something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a blog can be a breeze. Blogging CMS platforms such as Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace and Drupal provide a rich ecosystem, even for those who aren't technical enough to run their own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this only solves the content portion of replacing Medium, and not the distribution. There's no easy solution there, and your best bet is to post on as many channels (Twitter, Reddit, HN, etc...) as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a few Medium alternatives out there. I personally post my blog to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dev.to (which you might be reading this on right now)&lt;/a&gt; as they support the features I need to control my own content. As a product guy, there are definitely some UI changes I would make, but the overall experience is much better than Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India to order taxi aggregators like Uber, Ola to go electric</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to order taxi aggregators like Uber and Ola to convert 40% of their fleet of cars to electric by April 2026, according to a source and records of government meetings to discuss new rules for clean mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20190606&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1394975154&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEF550XB&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: Mahindra's, e2oPlus, operated by Indian ride-hailing company Ola, is seen at an electric vehicle charging station in Nagpur, India January 24, 2018.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber and Ola, both backed by Softbank Group, would need to start converting their fleet as early as next year to achieve 2.5% electrification by 2021, 5% by 2022, 10% by 2023 before hiking it to 40%, according to the person and the records reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxi players, like Ola, have previously attempted to operate electric cars in the country, but with little success given inadequate infrastructure and high costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Delhi, however, is looking to push the new policy to boost the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as it tries to bring down its oil imports and curb pollution so it can meet its commitment as part of the 2015 Paris climate change treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian think-tank Niti Aayog, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and which plays a crucial role in policymaking, is working with several ministries on the EV policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations will eventually become a formal policy, with or without changes, subject to approval by the federal government, the source said, adding the idea is to “push electrification through public transport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbouring China, home to the world’s top auto market, is already leading the world in electrification by setting tough EV sales targets for car makers and offering incentives to taxi operators to increase their fleet of clean-fuel cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV sales in India grew three-fold to 3,600 in the year ended March but still account for about 0.1% of the 3.3 million diesel and gasoline cars sold in the country over the period, industry data showed. China’s electric car sales, meanwhile, rose 62% in 2018 to 1.3 million vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meeting in New Delhi on May 28, Niti Aayog officials and the ministries of road transport, power, renewable energy and steel, as well as the departments of heavy industries and trade, were among those recommending taxi operators in India gradually convert to electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also recommended that all new cars sold for commercial use should only be electric from April 2026, a change that would also apply to Uber and Ola, said the person who has direct knowledge of the matter but spoke on condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorcycles and scooters sold for commercial purposes, like food delivery or for use by e-commerce companies, will also need to be electric from April 2023, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has seen a boom in food delivery apps like Zomato and Swiggy, which counts Naspers and Tencent as investors. Sales by e-commerce firms like Amazon.com and Walmart-owned Flipkart are also rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has also suggested a plan to gradually introduce electric buses within cities, with 5% of the fleet electric by 2023, rising to 30% by 2026. Thereafter all new city buses would need to be electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland manufacture buses for intracity travel in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MOTORBIKES TOO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EV proposal comes weeks after the inter-ministerial committee recommended electrifying most motorbikes and scooters for private use and all three-wheeled autorickshaws within the next six to eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are several electric scooter manufacturers in the country including Ather Energy, Hero Electric and Okinawa, there are only two car makers that build and sell electric cars - Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra and Tata Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxi operators have so far had little success operating electric cars in India. Ola launched a pilot project in the central Indian city of Nagpur in 2017 but a year later drivers, unhappy with long wait times at charging stations and high operating expenses, wanted to return to gasoline cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola, however, is not giving up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Ola Electric Mobility unit in March raised 4 billion rupees ($58 million) from investors including venture capital funds Tiger Global and Matrix Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also raised $300 million from Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors and formed a strategic partnership with the South Korean duo to help build India-specific EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi’s government in 2017 had set an ambitious target to electrify new cars and utility vehicles by 2030 but resistance from the industry forced it to scale back the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google to Acquire Looker</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/expanding-our-platform-for-business-intelligence-and-embedded-analytics</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/expanding-our-platform-for-business-intelligence-and-embedded-analytics</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re very excited to announce that Google has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc.xyz/investor/news/releases/2019/0606/&quot;&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt;, a unified platform for business intelligence, data applications, and embedded analytics. The acquisition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://looker.com/blog/looker-to-join-google-cloud&quot;&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be complete later this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Upon the close of the acquisition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/press/pdf/Google-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Looker.pdf&quot;&gt;Looker will join Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental requirement for organizations wanting to transform themselves digitally is the need to store, manage, and analyze large quantities of data from a variety of sources. Google Cloud offers customers a broad and integrated suite of cloud services to ingest data in real time, cleanse it, process it, aggregate it in a highly scalable data warehouse and analyze it. Many customers use Google Cloud, including Google BigQuery as their Enterprise Data Warehouse, for business analytics—using SQL to query real-time data streams; running fully managed Hadoop and Spark clusters; and using machine learning to automatically categorize and run forecasting and predictions on their data. A rapidly growing list of customers are also migrating their existing enterprise data warehouses from legacy technology stacks to our business analytics offering. These customers are choosing to do so because our offering is comprehensive, easy to use, cost effective and scales from a few gigabytes to multiple petabytes with excellent performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looker extends our business analytics offering with two important capabilities—first, the ability to define business metrics once in a consistent way across data sources. This makes it easy for anyone to query data while maintaining consistent definitions in their calculations, ensuring teams get accurate results. Second, Looker also provides users with a powerful analytics platform that delivers applications for business intelligence and use-case specific solutions such as Sales Analytics, as well as a flexible, embedded analytics product to collaborate on business decisions. The addition of Looker to Google Cloud will help us offer customers a more complete analytics solution from ingesting data to visualizing results and integrating data and insights into their daily workflows. It will also help us deliver industry specific analytics solutions in our key verticals, whether that’s supply chain analytics in retailing; media analytics in entertainment; or healthcare analytics at global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition builds on an existing partnership between our two companies where we share more than 350 joint customers, such as Buzzfeed, Hearst, King, Sunrun, WPP Essence, and Yahoo! who are already using our products together to unlock the value of their business data—from customer-centric marketing and support, to data-driven product development, and complex financial planning and budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The combination of Google Cloud and Looker will enable us to further accelerate our leadership as a WordPress digital experience platform,” said Heather Brunner, Chairwoman and CEO, WP Engine. &quot;By combining our BigQuery data warehouse with extended BI and visualization tools from Looker, we'll be empowered with faster, more actionable data insights that will help drive our business forward and better serve our customers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement also continues our strategic commitment to multi-cloud. While we deepen the integration of Looker into Google Cloud Platform (GCP), customers will continue to benefit from Looker’s multi-cloud functionality and its ability to bring together data from SaaS applications like Salesforce, Marketo, and Zendesk, as well as traditional data sources. This empowers companies to create a cohesive layer built on any cloud database, including Amazon Redshift, Azure SQL, Snowflake, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server or Teradata, as well as on other Public Clouds, and in on-premise data centers. Looker customers can rest assured that the high-quality support experience that Looker has provided will be bolstered by the resources, expertise, and global presence of our Cloud team. We will also continue to support best of breed analytics and visualization tools to provide customers the choice to use a variety of technologies with Google Cloud’s Analytics offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any business that is looking for a partner to help drive digital transformation, the combination of Google Cloud and Looker will offer an incredible data management and analytics platform. We’re thrilled to bring more robust data management solutions to our customers and look forward to welcoming the Looker team to Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Google's replacements aren't great. If you Google &quot;My Trips&quot; or &quot;My Past Trips,&quot; you'll be sent to the Google Travel website, which still contains your Trip info. A website is not an app replacement.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/&quot;&gt;wild ride of service shutdowns&lt;/a&gt; never stops. Next up on the chopping block is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/travel/answer/9337634&quot;&gt;Google Trips&lt;/a&gt;, a trip organization app that is popular with frequent travelers. Recently Google started notifying users of the pending shutdown directly in the Trips app; a splash screen now pops up before the app starts, saying &quot;We're saying goodbye to Google Trips Aug 5,&quot; along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/travel/answer/9337634&quot;&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; to a now all-too-familiar Google shutdown support document.&lt;/p&gt;

Trips was a well-received app with more than five million downloads on the Play store and a 4.1 rating. Usually when you schedule a trip, a plethora of reservation emails arrive in your inbox for things like the plane flight, hotel, and/or car rental, and Google Trips would automatically suck up all this information and create a basic outline of your trip. From there it leveraged Google Maps information, displaying nearby attractions, things to do, and other planning information. When you needed to quickly reference something, it was a lot easier to open Google Trips than it was to start digging through your email inbox. Trips also had a focus on offline information access, downloading all this reservation information and even prompting you to download your destination area in Google Maps for offline access.
&lt;p&gt;The death of Google Trips is part of Google's big travel revamp. The company recently launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/travel&quot;&gt;Google Travel&lt;/a&gt; website, which in addition to most of the Trips information, also serves as (wait for it...) &lt;em&gt;a search engine&lt;/em&gt; for hotels, flights, and travel agency-style combo bookings. Google Travel is &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of advertisements—the site is probably 50% ads, and these are very poorly labeled and look like the core user interface. Entire UI elements like &quot;Check Availability&quot; and &quot;Select a room&quot; just have &quot;Ads&quot; next to the main title, indicating the entire section or page is an advertisement. The point of interest information seems to be organic information from Google Maps, but I think every actionable item (like booking hotels and flights) eventually leads to a list of exclusively paid ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This is Google Travel. On the plus side, with monetization like this, it probably won't be shut down any time soon.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Ron Amadeo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how horrible and full of ads Google Travel is, it is only a website and not an app, so it is not a replacement for Google Trips. Google's message notes that &quot;many&quot;—not &quot;all&quot;—of Trips' features will &quot;live on in other Google products.&quot; Apparently those two features are Google Maps and Google Search. In search, you can type in &quot;My trips&quot; or &quot;my past trips&quot; and you'll be sent to the Google Travel website, which still contains your info from Trips. A mobile website is not ideal. Google's support page notes that in the future, Google Maps will display trip reservations in the &quot;My Places&quot; screen. This new &quot;upcoming&quot; section exists on my phone, but it doesn't show past trips, and I don't have any future trips, so I'm not sure if it works yet. The support page claims it is a future feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by our count the 13th Google shutdown this year, which has previously included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-kills-the-chromecast-audio/&quot;&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2683267&quot;&gt;YouTube Annotations&lt;/a&gt;, Google Fiber's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/google-fiber-exits-louisville-after-shoddy-installs-left-exposed-wires-in-roads/&quot;&gt;service in Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, Android Things' &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/android-things-is-no-longer-for-things-focuses-on-smart-speakers-and-displays/&quot;&gt;IoT support&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/google-promises-to-shut-down-two-of-its-seven-messaging-apps/&quot;&gt;Google Allo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-spotlight-stories-shutting-down-1203163117/&quot;&gt;Spotlight Stories&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html&quot;&gt;goo.gl URL shortener&lt;/a&gt;, Gmail's &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020249393-Important-update-about-Gmail-on-IFTTT&quot;&gt;IFTTT support&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/here-lies-google-inbox-a-radical-rethink-of-how-email-should-work/&quot;&gt;Google Inbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-shuts-down-april-2-all-data-will-be-deleted/&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/nest-the-company-died-at-google-io-2019/&quot;&gt;various bits of Nest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/googles-killing-the-youtube-gaming-app-this-week/&quot;&gt;YouTube Gaming app&lt;/a&gt; and portal. Later this year we'll get to deal with the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-great-google-hangouts-shutdown-begins-october-2019/&quot;&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/youtube-music-will-replace-google-play-music-but-wont-kill-user-uploads/&quot;&gt;Google Play Music.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Increasingly, Google users are having the perfectly functional tools they rely on taken away on a whim, and I think these rapid-fire shutdowns are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/&quot;&gt;damaging the Google brand&lt;/a&gt; with the user base that matters the most: current Google customers. Some of these shutdowns represent a complete abandonment of a user base, and others represent a disruptive transition to a new and different service. Either option is a bad look for Google and makes its products look unreliable and untrustworthy. In this case it's unclear what the new service's Google Maps integration will look like, and funneling users to the ad-heavy Google Travel website is not a welcome change.
&lt;p&gt;Google's potential for damage isn't just about its brand. Whenever the company kicks its users off of one of its services, the users are forced to adopt something new. Google hopes everyone will follow the instructions on the transition support page, but if you're going to have to change your habits anyway, why not take stock of the wider market? Comfortable users with working products stick around. Shutting down a product forces users to adopt a new service, and that new service won't necessarily be a Google product.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft grabs close-up thirty feet above asteroid</title>

Inside the red circle is the shadow of the tiny target marker Hayabusa2 will use to scoop up a sample of the asteroid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;JAXA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakableTextP1&quot;&gt;The Japanese space agency, JAXA, has been circling the asteroid Ryugu with its spacecraft Hayabusa2 for almost a year now and the agency has even shot a cannonball at the space rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakableTextP2&quot;&gt;That shot &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot; section=&quot;shortcodeLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/videos/japans-hayabusa2-space-probe-fires-bullet-into-asteroid/&quot;&gt;kicked up debris that Hayabusa2 collected in February&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but the agency wanted to go again -- and collect debris from further inside Ryugu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 30, &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot; section=&quot;shortcodeLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/hayabusa2-japan-bombed-an-asteroid-and-now-its-preparing-to-collect-the-debris-ryugu/&quot;&gt;Jaxa performed a daring maneuver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that brought its spacecraft within 9 meters (approximately 30 feet) of Ryugu to drop a target marker on its surface. The success of the mission was documented by the spacecraft's official Twitter account (because it's 2019), but on June 5, the agency released a photo that is absolutely wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twitterContainer&quot; readability=&quot;7.5875706214689&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;8.9265536723164&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The target marker separation on May 30 during PPTD-TM1A was caught at the last moment by the small monitor camera, CAM-H! The image time was May 30, 11:18 JST (on-board time) at an altitude of about 9m. CAM-H was built with donations from all of you &amp;amp; is a big success! Thank you! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pHSwqPaywh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pHSwqPaywh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's pause for a second and consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image comes from a 600-kilogram, refrigerator-sized robot traveling at about 15 miles per second, around 170 million miles from Earth. It shows the shadow of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft and just below that shadow a tiny, spherical shadow. That tiny shadow is the target marker being released onto the asteroid. Crazy, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

Hayabusa2 will move to sample the asteroid for a second time later this year, before returning to Earth with samples in December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber data reveals motoring slower than walking in many cities</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1638&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption wp-caption-wrap alignnone&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-image-caption&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot; ng-class=&quot;caption_state&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;3mph? Most Londoners can walk faster than that. So, why ride Uber?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;Ride hailing behemoth Uber has revealed what many have long suspected, that motorists in major cities such as London often crawl along no faster than pedestrians. The company has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://movement.uber.com/explore/london/speeds/query?lang=en-GB&amp;amp;dt%5Btpb%5D=ALL_DAY&amp;amp;dt%5Bwd;%5D=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&amp;amp;dt%5Bdr%5D%5Bsd%5D=2018-01-01&amp;amp;dt%5Bdr%5D%5Bed%5D=2018-01-31&amp;amp;ff=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://movement.uber.com/explore/london/speeds/query?lang=en-GB&amp;amp;dt%5Btpb%5D=ALL_DAY&amp;amp;dt%5Bwd;%5D=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&amp;amp;dt%5Bdr%5D%5Bsd%5D=2018-01-01&amp;amp;dt%5Bdr%5D%5Bed%5D=2018-01-31&amp;amp;ff=&quot;&gt;Uber Movement Speeds&lt;/a&gt;, an online and downloadable treasure trove of actual travel times and speeds. It shows that motorists queuing to get through Trafalgar Square rarely exceed four miles per hour, and on Northumberland Avenue motorists do not average more than three miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore often slightly faster to walk than drive in London but, for true urban speed, it&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s fastest to cycle. Smartphone data from riders and drivers schlepping meals for restaurant-to-home courier service Deliveroo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2018/11/07/data-from-millions-of-smartphone-journeys-proves-cyclists-faster-in-cities-than-cars-and-motorbikes/#7c585d9f3794&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2018/11/07/data-from-millions-of-smartphone-journeys-proves-cyclists-faster-in-cities-than-cars-and-motorbikes/#7c585d9f3794&quot;&gt;earlier confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that bicycles are faster than cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as London, Uber Movement Speeds has data from Uber drivers in New York City, Seattle, Cincinnati, and Nairobi. Uber said the release of the datasets–with more on the way–would help cities “solve complicated urban mobility challenges” including “isolating high bicycle injury corridors with high … speeds … where a city [might] invest in protected bicycle or traffic calming infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Speeds dataset joins Uber’s 2017 release of Movement, a dataset of average travel times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making our cities move more efficiently matters to us all,” claims Uber. “That&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s why we're providing access to anonymized data from over 2 billion trips to help improve urban planning around the world.&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the increased traffic congestion in cities around the world is due to the extra journeys generated by Uber. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Uber-Lyft-account-for-of-traffic-increase-in-13830608.php?utm_campaign=sfgate&amp;amp;utm_source=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Ftechnology%2Farticle%2FUber-Lyft-San-Francisco-pros-cons-ride-hailing-13841277.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Uber-Lyft-account-for-of-traffic-increase-in-13830608.php?utm_campaign=sfgate&amp;amp;utm_source=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Ftechnology%2Farticle%2FUber-Lyft-San-Francisco-pros-cons-ride-hailing-13841277.php&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that between 2010 and 2016, traffic congestion in San Francisco increased by 62% with Uber and Lyft responsible for more than half of that rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Speeds dataset provides average speeds down to street and hourly levels, and over the years that Uber has been collecting data from its drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company claims Speeds “adds a valuable dataset to the public domain, giving transportation planners a historical view into the functioning of the overall transportation network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclists could use the data to plot journeys, avoiding those green roads where the “free flow” speeds are highest. Red lines mean speeds that are much slower than “free flowing” traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Speeds data helps planners and city officials evaluate the impact of infrastructure investments, understand where throughout the city congestion is occurring and analyze the street network,” says Emily Strand, head of public policy for Uber Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Speeds data can be a powerful planning dataset beyond cars. For example, speeds data and pedestrian and cyclist data can be linked [to] help planners better understand where cyclists are most at risk and prioritize and plan for more protected bike lanes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the year, Uber is planning to release data from its New Mobility options, including the Jump city bike and scooter programs from cities such as San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous year Uber has been criticized for not providing cities with the data it collects from its drivers citing the need to preserve its competitive advantage. The company also refused requests from the city of Los Angeles to provide data on scooter and bike usage, calling it a “massive overcollection” that could endanger rider privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That driving in cities is slow is not news. In 2007 the stars of the TV motoring program &lt;em&gt;Top Gear&lt;/em&gt; were tasked with crossing rush-hour London in a car, on the Tube, on a bicycle, and in a 225bhp racing speedboat on the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James May stated: “It’s a race to find out what is the quickest way to cross a busy city. Car, bicycle, public transport, whatever?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route chosen was Kew Bridge to London City airport, 18.8 miles of what the BBC admitted was an “automotive quagmire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Hammond on the bicycle reached the airport fifteen minutes ahead of Jeremy Clarkson in his Cougar speedboat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May, in the car, came last, slower even than The Stig on a combination of buses and the London Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement from the BBC said “the bicycle came first, then the speedboat, then the [Tube], and finally the car. Ahem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1643&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption wp-caption-wrap alignnone&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-image-caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot; ng-class=&quot;caption_state&quot;&gt;

&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While motorists often fume at the slow speeds at bottlenecks, they often try to make up for it where the potential for &lt;span&gt;“free flow” speeds is greater. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uber’s Speeds dataset also shows that exceeding the speed limit on some&lt;/span&gt; roads is endemic, but the company says its data is anonymized and cannot be used to track–and sanction–individual speeding drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
