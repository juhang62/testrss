&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May credit reporting service Equifax's website was breached by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/equifax-website-hack-exposes-data-for-143-million-us-consumers/&quot;&gt;attackers who eventually made off with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/equifax-website-hack-exposes-data-for-143-million-us-consumers/&quot;&gt;Social Security numbers, names, and a dizzying amount of other details&lt;/a&gt; for some 145.5 million US consumers. For several hours on Wednesday the site was compromised again, this time to deliver fraudulent Adobe Flash updates, which when clicked, infected visitors' computers with adware that was detected by only three of 65 antivirus providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Abrams, an independent security analyst by day, happened to visit the site Wednesday evening to contest what he said was false information he had just found on his credit report. Eventually, his browser opened up a page on the domain hxxp:centerbluray.info that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/first-flash.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;415&quot; data-width=&quot;653&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/first-flash-640x407.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/first-flash.jpg 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Randy Abrams&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
He was understandably incredulous. The site that previously gave up personal data for virtually every US person with a credit history was once again under the control of attackers, this time trying to trick Equifax visitors into installing crapware Symantec calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-061213-2441-99&quot;&gt;Adware.Eorezo&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing a thing or two about drive-by campaigns, Abrams figured the chances were slim he'd see the download on follow-on visits. To fly under the radar, attackers frequently serve the downloads to only a select number of visitors, and then only once.
&lt;p&gt;Abrams tried anyway, and to his amazement, he encountered the bogus Flash download links on at least three subsequent visits. The picture above this post is the higher-resolution screenshot he captured during one visit. He also provided the video below. It shows an Equifax page redirecting the browser to at least four domains before finally opening the Flash download at the same centerbluray.info page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XzyDR7f7Wm0?rel=0?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Equifax Flash Download&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file that got delivered when Abrams clicked through is called MediaDownloaderIron.exe. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/6153f429c0cedc721846e60255834ae0f43829cc6a387b766de6f301dab54eca/analysis/1506995209/&quot;&gt;VirusTotal entry&lt;/a&gt; shows only Panda, Symantec, and Webroot detecting the file as adware. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/6153f429c0cedc721846e60255834ae0f43829cc6a387b766de6f301dab54eca?environmentId=100&quot;&gt;separate malware analysis&lt;/a&gt; from Packet Security shows the code is highly obfuscated and takes pains to conceal itself from reverse engineering. Malwarebytes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/f66a103e2df039c7f0b918dec692546d84d516321d5367f6b03c8c79f9251cc7/detection&quot;&gt;flagged the centerbluray.info site as one that pushes malware&lt;/a&gt;, while both Eset and Avira provided similar malware warnings for one of the intermediate domains, newcyclevaults.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/site-blocked.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;310&quot; data-width=&quot;1023&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/site-blocked-640x194.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/site-blocked.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Randy Abrams&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Malvertising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not yet clear precisely how the Flash download page got displayed. It's possible Equifax was running ads through a third-party network and those are responsible for the redirects. But even if that's true, the net result is that the site is arguably compromised in some way, since administrators can't control the pages visitors see when they're trying to use key functions, some which require visitors to enter Social Security numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours after this post went live, an Ars reader e-mailed to say he recently encountered a sketchy ad when putting a temporary fraud alert on his Equifax file. The reader wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I clicked it (from Gmail on Android) I was redirected to a spam page shortly after seeing the Equifax credit file form. I thought maybe it was an anomaly because it didn't happen again. But after reading your article about how sometimes hacks will redirect randomly I tried the link again just now and sure enough I got a spam page again (lucksupply.club saying I won an iPhone X). This is Chrome-in-a-tab from Gmail so i don't believe there's any extensions or other malware on my device that could have caused this redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot1.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;2560&quot; data-width=&quot;1440&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot1-640x1138.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot1-1280x2276.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot2.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;2560&quot; data-width=&quot;1440&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot2-640x1138.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot2-1280x2276.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hour this post was being reported and written, Abrams was unable to reproduce the redirects leading to the malicious download. It's possible Equifax has cleaned up its site. It's also possible the attackers have shut down for the night and have the ability to return at will to visit still worse misfortunes on visitors. Equifax representatives didn't respond to an e-mail that included a link to the video and sought comment for this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post updated at 6:18 am and 7:10 am 10/12/2017 Pacific time to discuss ad networks and add details of ad served on reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Containers and Distributed Systems: Where They Came from and Where They’re Going</title>
<link>https://mesosphere.com/blog/containers-distributed-systems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mesosphere.com/blog/containers-distributed-systems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Florian Leibert, CEO of Mesosphere, recently sat down with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmcmanis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Chuck McManis&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the challenges he faced developing early distributed systems, the origins of container technology, and the future of computing. If you’re on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, you probably already know Chuck, who is active under his handle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ChuckMcM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ChuckMcM&lt;/a&gt;. This fascinating conversation delves into the early problems Chuck and his teams had to solve when building distributed systems, the lessons they learned, and how they’ve shaped the present – and probably the future of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Finding the Mechanism Within the Mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian Leibert (FL):&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Chuck, can you give us a background of your engineering career, which is as long as it is impressive. You’ve really worked in the lower layers of the stack for a very long time, and maybe you can just tell us a little bit about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck McManis (CM):&lt;/strong&gt; I came to the Bay Area in the mid ’80s and I went to work for Intel. Then I was recruited out of Intel by a startup called Sun Microsystems. I joined in ’86, the day after they went public, in the kernel group. It was a very fun place to be, with a lot of smart people, and a lot of people a lot smarter than I was, so I could learn from day-to-day there. We were working very closely with Berkeley on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;BSD distribution of Unix&lt;/a&gt;. I was part of the Basic Open Network Computing (BONC) group that was doing networking for the kernel. We had just come up with a distributed file system format called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1094&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Network File System&lt;/a&gt;, and were implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Network_Computing_Remote_Procedure_Call&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;remote procedure calls&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion of networking was very exciting. Sun was bringing its entire company onto a network and we might have had over 1,500 machines. It was a huge number, impossible to recreate elsewhere, but today it would be trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all new ground, and we started running into complications when we built these systems and distributed them, and how we made that possible. Kernel programming was exciting to me because there was no room for error. Then I discovered the most exciting role of all, network programmer. If the network programmer makes a mistake in their code, they could bring the entire network down and crash 1,500 kernels. I was drawn to that level of complexity because I’ve always enjoyed solving really complex problems and finding the mechanism within the mechanism. I designed a very complicated service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIS%2B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;NIS+&lt;/a&gt;, the first service that didn’t exist on a single machine. It was actually a collection of machines, presenting as a single service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran into a lot of problems that plague distributed systems even today, about naming, time synchronization, logging, and making new transactions. This was around the time that Leslie Lamport published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;groundbreaking paper on the Byzantine general problem&lt;/a&gt; that influenced us. I re-read that paper a little while ago, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8697029&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;it was on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it still does a great job of providing the core, basic understanding you have to have to build distributed systems. Distributed systems evolved very rapidly in the late ’80s and early ’90s. There was a tremendous effort to make procedure calls go across machines and to make them transparent so that a program could be written with a procedure, and the procedures could be distributed across multiple machines, and would just run as it always had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making Distributed Computing Easier&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL:&lt;/strong&gt; Chuck, you’re probably familiar with Mesos by now, and you know that the idea of Mesos was to really make it super easy to write distributed systems. Of course, now with Kubernetes, as well, you have something similar. People want to make distributed programming much easier. That’s still as true today as it was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CM:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, absolutely. Early on there was a war between multiprocessing and distributing processing, supercomputing versus network computing, and this has been an ongoing battle even to today. A distributed system requires a network fabric between nodes and this is always much, much less bandwidth than what’s internal to a single node. After Sun Microsystems, I did a couple of startups, then went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Network Appliance&lt;/a&gt; which was building filers. At that point I started to focus on distributed systems from the angle of scaling client storage independent of the architecture of the processor scaling and building distributed RAID arrays. The thing with distributed file systems is that they’re very state dependent. You can’t have a bunch of people changing and moving files without properly managing state. So one of the things we discovered was that you have a lot of metadata that has to be true across all nodes before you can finalize a transaction. The metadata and how fast you could move it around the network was the constraint on how fast you could run these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Origins of Container Technology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL:&lt;/strong&gt; At Sun Microsystems back in the day, you guys were already working in the kernel, on the operating system side on isolation and packaging, right? You basically came up with Docker before Docker was around, or at least with things like Solaris zones and C groups. From your experience, what actually motivated that work at Solaris, and why did it take so long for the world to really pick up this topic? And why are so many today hyping a technology that’s old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CM:&lt;/strong&gt; So that’s a really good question, and it relates to this battle between parallel processing systems and distributed systems. Within Sun Microsystems there were two efforts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20150001285&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Beowulf clusters&lt;/a&gt; and typical multiprocessing machines. In the Beowulf cluster, which was inexpensive, one of the features it brought to the table was that you could take out a node and use it in the cluster and it would not affect the bandwidth, it would not affect the resource utilization on other nodes. This made Beowulf clusters desirable, but the parallel processing guys didn’t have the same luxury, so they really wanted to develop architectures where dedicated servers ran specific tasks using a kernel that could isolate the parallel processes. Each server would be sized to the appropriate task, and when the mission changed for the server, it was basically useless junk. There was a tremendous demand from customers who said, “I don’t want to buy a new machine every year. I want to be able to reuse the same hardware in different ways. I want to be able to reconfigure it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key needs were better resource utilization, process isolation, and the need to prevent information leakage. It turned out that about twenty years earlier IBM did sort of solve that problem with partition isolation, but they did that on custom mainframe hardware and architecture. It turned out that everyone wanted that too, but on low-cost commodity hardware. And it was at that particular insight that Google had internalized in early 2000 and gotten really good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right about that time, I got recruited to work at Google in their platforms group to scale storage. And that was a tremendous opportunity because I was developing extremely large network storage systems. I realized a very important point about distributed systems, that there’s a point where the metadata between the systems overwhelms the actual service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of network bandwidth available to support the service actually becomes the factor that decides how much data you can get in and out of the system. Google was very famous for having a policy where every node was uniformly the same, so that you could just schedule things on top of them. I brought in a somewhat heretical notion that perhaps storage can be a first-class service running on equipment that did nothing but provided a storage API to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Containers Go Mainstream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL:&lt;/strong&gt; So it looks like a lot your work, throughout your career, has been around isolation, has been around making resources shared more efficiently. We’ve talked a little bit about the early origins of container technology at Sun Microsystems. Just to double-click on container technology, why do you think it took so long for this technology that was built into Solaris to become mainstream with Docker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CM:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason is because computer performance improved faster than the need for process isolation and greater system efficiency so people could just solve their problems with more hardware. That held us for a while, but then having more and more hardware started to create its own set of problems. Computers are so fast today, disks are so dense, memory is so cheap, that it takes a fairly big problem for you to actually want to partition it. Most people buy cheap hardware and if it’s only utilized by 20 percent, they don’t care because they don’t have a lot of money invested in it. That was not the case for AWS, Azure, Google, or Facebook. If you look at the early work in containers, it came from the ability for these companies to simplify and manage their infrastructure and run the most efficient operation they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started offering these things as a service, and their customers started to see the benefits of being able to deploy standardized configurations quickly. Then those customer started to want that infrastructure in their own datacenter to gain the efficiency and functionality of a Google or Amazon. Plus, when employees from Amazon and Google left those companies and went elsewhere, they wanted these tools so they started to recreate them. What started as a resource utilization problem inside very large companies became a lot of open source tools that the rest of the world could use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s Next for Containers?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on your experience with distributed systems, do you think that we’re going to have a similar path where some of these companies like Google, where you’ve really solved hard networking problems, the solutions there will actually trickle into mainstream maybe even with initiatives such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/containernetworking/cni&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Container Network Interface&lt;/a&gt; and other projects that are out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CM:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, and I think this is a big data problem. Plus, it’s all the rage today for you to take very large data sets and apply algorithms that are collectively known as machine learning or correlation algorithms, and you can extract insights from the data that were not previously visible. That’s being done by distributed systems because they’re more cost effective to scale and this exacerbates the network bandwidth problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Future of Distributed Computing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL:&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds like you’re saying that you believe there’s going to be a future where there are a lot more clouds than just the three or four centralized clouds we currently have and there are going to be clouds at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CM:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Much of this revolves around how cheap processors have gotten. We can build clouds of cheap processors connected to very inexpensive sensors and readers at the edge. They’ll be a self-contained cloud. You could have tens of thousands of these in a single location. They may not even need to be connected to the Internet as they can function on their own. They’re their own cloud. It’s similar to the technology we were building at the very beginning of distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;nav/&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published on 10th of October 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the simplest Unix command you know?&lt;br/&gt;There's &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;, which prints a string to stdout and &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, which always terminates with an exit code of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the rows of simple Unix commands, there's also &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;. If you run it without arguments, you get an infinite stream of y's, separated by a newline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(...you get the idea)
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be pointless in the beginning turns out to be pretty helpful :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;yes | sh boring_installation.sh
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever installed a program, which required you to type &quot;y&quot; and hit enter to keep going? &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; to the rescue! It will carefully fulfill this duty, so you can keep watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhBExhldRXQ&quot;&gt;Pootie Tang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing yes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a basic version in... uhm... BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;10 PRINT &quot;y&quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;20 GOTO 10
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the same thing in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, eh? Not so quick!&lt;br/&gt;Turns out, that program is quite slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;python yes.py | pv -r &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[4.17MiB/s]
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that with the built-in version on my Mac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;yes | pv -r &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[34.2MiB/s]
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried to write a quicker version in Rust. Here's my first attempt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expletive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unwrap_or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expletive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some explanations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The string we want to print in a loop is the first command line parameter and is named &lt;em&gt;expletive&lt;/em&gt;. I learned this word from the &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; manpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;unwrap_or&lt;/code&gt; to get the &lt;em&gt;expletive&lt;/em&gt; from the parameters. In case the parameter is not set, we use &quot;y&quot; as a default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default parameter gets converted from a string slice (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;str&lt;/code&gt;) into an &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; string on the heap (&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;) using &lt;code&gt;into()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;cargo run --release | pv -r &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compiling yes v0.1.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.0 secs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Running `target/release/yes`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[2.35MiB/s] 
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops, that doesn't look any better. It's even slower than the Python version! That caught my attention, so I looked around for the source code of a C implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/4c37048d6dd7b8f65481c8c86ef8cede2e782bb3/usr/src/cmd/yes.c&quot;&gt;very first version of the program&lt;/a&gt;, released with Version 7 Unix and famously authored by Ken Thompson on &lt;nobr&gt;Jan 10, 1979&lt;/nobr&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No magic here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blame/master/src/yes.c&quot;&gt;128-line-version from the GNU coreutils, which is mirrored on Github&lt;/a&gt;. After 25 years, &lt;em&gt;it is still under active development!&lt;/em&gt; The last code change happened around a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/4cdb1703aff044de44d27e0558714542197f6dad&quot;&gt;year ago&lt;/a&gt;. That's quite fast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;# brew install coreutils
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gyes | pv -r &amp;gt; /dev/null 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[854MiB/s]
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Repeatedly output the buffer until there is a write error; then fail.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;full_write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;STDOUT_FILENO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; buf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; bufused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; bufused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! So they simply use a buffer to make write operations faster. The buffer size is defined by a constant named &lt;code&gt;BUFSIZ&lt;/code&gt;, which gets chosen on each system so as to make I/O efficient (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Controlling-Buffering.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). On my system, that was defined as 1024 bytes. I actually had better performance with 8192 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've extended my Rust program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;io::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUFSIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8192&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expletive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unwrap_or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; writer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BufWriter::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;with_capacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUFSIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;io::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stdout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;writeln!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;writer,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expletive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unwrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is, that the buffer size is a multiple of four, to ensure &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/381368/270334&quot;&gt;memory alignment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running that gave me 51.3MiB/s. Faster than the version, which comes with my system, but still way slower than the results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/6gxduc/how_is_gnu_yes_so_fast/&quot;&gt;this Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; that I found, where the author talks about 10.2GiB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the Rust community did not disappoint.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/75fll1/a_little_story_about_the_yes_unix_command/&quot;&gt;hit the Rust subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/nwydo&quot;&gt;nwydo&lt;/a&gt; pointed out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4wde08/optimising_yes_any_further_ideas/&quot;&gt;previous discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the same topic. Here's their optimized code, that breaks the 3GB/s mark on my machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;io::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;std::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ffi::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;OsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUFFER_CAPACITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to_bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;os_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; OsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;u8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;arg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cow::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Owned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;process::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's a whole different ballgame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing, that I could contribute was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cgati/yes/pull/3/files&quot;&gt;removing an unnecessary &lt;code&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trivial program &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; turns out not to be so trivial after all. It uses output buffering and memory alignment to improve performance. Re-implementing Unix tools is fun and makes me appreciate the nifty tricks, which make our computers fast.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Evidence That Online Dating Is Changing Society</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609091/first-evidence-that-online-dating-is-changing-the-nature-of-society/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609091/first-evidence-that-online-dating-is-changing-the-nature-of-society/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, nobody met a partner online. Then, in the 1990s, came the first dating websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;l-automated-trending--ordered&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;automated-trending&quot; data-widget-layout=&quot;ordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;automated-trending__h&quot;&gt;Recommended for You&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;automated-trending__tz-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Match.com went live in 1995. A new wave of dating websites, such as OKCupid, emerged in the early 2000s. And the 2012 arrival of Tinder changed dating even further. Today, more than one-third of marriages start online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, these sites have had a huge impact on dating behavior. But now the first evidence is emerging that their effect is much more profound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-img article-img--text-col&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/internet-dating.png?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=16&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=812&amp;amp;ch=457&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/internet-dating.png?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=16&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=812&amp;amp;ch=457 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/internet-dating.png?sw=1200&amp;amp;cx=16&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=812&amp;amp;ch=457 2x&quot;/&gt;
The way people meet their partners has changed dramatically in recent years
&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, researchers have studied the nature of the networks that link people to each other. These social networks turn out to have a peculiar property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious type of network links each node with its nearest neighbors, in a pattern like a chess board or chicken wire. Another obvious kind of network links nodes at random. But real social networks are not like either of these. Instead, people are strongly connected to a relatively small group of neighbors and loosely connected to much more distant people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These loose connections turn out to be extremely important. “Those weak ties serve as bridges between our group of close friends and other clustered groups, allowing us to connect to the global community,” say Josue Ortega at the University of Essex in the U.K. and Philipp Hergovich at the University of Vienna in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loose ties have traditionally played a key role in meeting partners. While most people were unlikely to date one of their best friends, they were highly likely to date people who were linked with their group of friends; a friend of a friend, for example. In the language of network theory, dating partners were embedded in each other’s networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this has long been reflected in surveys of the way people meet their partners: through mutual friends, in bars, at work, in educational institutions, at church, through their families, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online dating has changed that. Today, online dating is the second most common way for heterosexual couples to meet. For homosexual couples, it is far and away the most popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has significant implications. “People who meet online tend to be complete strangers,” say Ortega and Hergovich. And when people meet in this way, it sets up social links that were previously nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that Ortega and Hergovich investigate is how this changes the racial diversity of society. “Understanding the evolution of interracial marriage is an important problem, for intermarriage is widely considered a measure of social distance in our societies,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers start by simulating what happens when extra links are introduced into a social network. Their network consists of men and women from different races who are randomly distributed. In this model, everyone wants to marry a person of the opposite sex but can only marry someone with whom a connection exists. This leads to a society with a relatively low level of interracial marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the researchers add random links between people from different ethnic groups, the level of interracial marriage changes dramatically. “Our model predicts nearly complete racial integration upon the emergence of online dating, even if the number of partners that individuals meet from newly formed ties is small,” say Ortega and Hergovich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is another surprising effect. The team measure the strength of marriages by measuring the average distance between partners before and after the introduction of online dating. “Our model also predicts that marriages created in a society with online dating tend to be stronger,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers compare the results of their models to the observed rates of interracial marriage in the U.S. This has been on the increase for some time, but the rates are still low, not least because interracial marriage was banned in some parts of the country until 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rate of increase changed at about the time that online dating become popular. “It is intriguing that shortly after the introduction of the first dating websites in 1995, like Match.com, the percentage of new marriages created by interracial couples increased rapidly,” say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase became steeper in the 2000s, when online dating became even more popular.  Then, in 2014, the proportion of interracial marriages jumped again. “It is interesting that this increase occurs shortly after the creation of Tinder, considered the most popular online dating app,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder has some 50 million users and produces more than 12 million matches a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this data doesn’t prove that online dating caused the rise in interracial marriages. But it is consistent with the hypothesis that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, research into the strength of marriage has found some evidence that married couples who meet online have lower rates of marital breakup than those who meet traditionally. That has the potential to significantly benefit society. And it’s exactly what Ortega and Hergovich’s model predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other factors that could contribute to the increase in interracial marriage. One is that the trend is the result of a reduction in the percentage of Americans who are white. If marriages were random, this should increase the number of interracial marriages, but not by the observed amount. “The change in the population composition in the U.S. cannot explain the huge increase in intermarriage that we observe,” say Ortega and Hergovich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves online dating as the main driver of this change. And if that’s the case, the model implies that this change is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a profound revelation. These changes are set to continue, and to benefit society as result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ref: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10478&quot;&gt;arxiv.org/abs/1709.10478&lt;/a&gt; : The Strength of Absent Ties: Social Integration via Online Dating&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RIP the Broccoli Tree</title>
<link>https://kottke.org/17/09/rip-the-broccoli-tree</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kottke.org/17/09/rip-the-broccoli-tree</guid>

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, Patrik Svedberg has been taking photos of a beautiful Swedish tree he dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebroccolitree.com/&quot;&gt;The Broccoli Tree&lt;/a&gt;. In a short time, the tree gained a healthy following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/thebroccolitree/&quot;&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, becoming both a tourist attraction and an online celebrity of sorts. (I posted about tree &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/15/06/the-broccoli-tree&quot;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.) Yesterday, Svedberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiQge5ltJq/&quot;&gt;posted a sad update&lt;/a&gt;: someone had vandalized the tree by sawing through one of the limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/broccoli-tree-vandal-01.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Broccoli Tree Vandal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the trees branches has now (a couple of days ago..?) been sawn in almost all the way through and it’s just a matter of time before it’ll fall off. I won’t be around to document it, others will for sure so I guess you lunatics who did it can enjoy every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon after, it was decided by some authority that the vandalism meant the entire tree had to come down. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZidk4NHpDW/&quot;&gt;A work crew arrived&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZi9UnsgYhW/&quot;&gt;now it’s gone&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/broccoli-tree-vandal-02.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Broccoli Tree Vandal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/ballad-reading-gaol&quot;&gt;once wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “Each man kills the thing he loves”. I don’t know exactly what Wilde meant by that, but our collective attention and obsession, amplified by the speed and intensity of the internet &amp;amp; social media, tends to ruin the things we love: authors, musicians, restaurants, actors, beloved movies, vacation spots, artists, democracies, and even a tree that became too famous to live.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Competitive Self-Play</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/competitive-self-play/?</guid>
<description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBcjhp4KSgQ?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;“0&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Post-Actions Post-Actions--reverse-icons&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/multiagent-competition&quot; class=&quot;Post-Actions--code&quot;&gt;View Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03748&quot; class=&quot;Post-Actions--paper&quot;&gt;Read Paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up competitions between multiple simulated 3D robots on a range of basic games, trained each agent with simple goals (push the opponent out of the sumo ring, reach the other side of the ring while preventing the other agent from doing the same, kick the ball into the net or prevent the other agent from doing so, and so on), then analyzed the different strategies that emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents initially receive dense rewards for behaviours that aid exploration like standing and moving forward, which are eventually annealed to zero in favor of being rewarded for just winning and losing. Despite the simple rewards, the agents learn subtle behaviors like tackling, ducking, faking, kicking and catching, and diving for the ball. Each agent’s neural network policy is independently trained with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347&quot;&gt;Proximal Policy Optimization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how complex behaviors can emerge through a combination of simple goals and competitive pressure, let's analyze the sumo wrestling task. Here we took the dense reward defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438&quot;&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; for training a humanoid to walk, removed the term for velocity, added the negative L2 distance from the center of the ring and took this as a dense exploration reward for our sumo agents. The agents were allowed to use this reward for exploration in the ring initially, then we slowly annealed it to zero so the agents would learn to optimize for the competition reward — pushing the other player out of the ring — for the remaining training iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is possible to design tasks and environments that require each of these skills, this requires effort and ingenuity on the part of human designers, and the agents' behaviors will be bounded in complexity by the problems that the human designer can pose for them. By developing agents through thousands of iterations of matches against successively better versions of themselves, we can create AI systems that successively bootstrap their own performance; we saw a similar phenomenon in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/&quot;&gt;Dota 2 project&lt;/a&gt;, where self-play let us create an RL agent that could beat top human players at a solo version of the e-sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agent trained on sumo wrestling, and then subjected to a variable unknown &quot;wind&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These agents also exhibit transfer learning, applying skills learned in one setting to succeed in another never-before-seen one. In one case, we took the agent trained on the self-play sumo wrestling task and faced it with the task of standing while being perturbed by &quot;wind&quot; forces. The agent managed to stay upright despite never seeing the windy environment or observing wind forces, while agents trained to walk using classical reinforcement learning would fall over immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agent trained to walk using classical reinforcement learning, and then subjected to a variable unknown &quot;wind&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our agents were overfitting by co-learning policies that were precisely tailored to counter specific opponents, but would fail when facing new ones with different characteristics. We dealt with this by pitting each agent against several different opponents rather than just one. These possible opponents come from an ensemble of policies that were trained in parallel as well as policies from earlier in the training process. Given this diversity of opponents, agents needed to learn general strategies and not just ones targeted to a specific opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/multiagent-competition&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; the MuJoCo environments and trained policies used in this work so that others can experiment with these systems.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;21.900722021661&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I was in the US and want to immigrate to Canada because of US broken H1B immigration system ( for me it will take 9 years to get a greencard). Here is what I did -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The immigration website of Saskatchewan province opens up randomly to apply for immigration. I missed it many times because there is no indication other than the &quot;Apply&quot; button being enabled and a small text in their homepage which says &quot;Applications are now 'open' &quot;. They will close the application intake when they have reached X number of applicants. So timing is very important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So I hacked up a script which diffs their home page every 10 minutes for &quot;open&quot; regex. When there is an &quot;open&quot; keyword in the diff, the python script calls twilio API to make a phone call to me along with an SMS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So this script was running in AWS for many weeks and one day I got the call. Logged in to Saskatchewan's immigration homepage and applied. Now I am in Canada as a permanent resident. Thanks to Twilio. edit: add H1B to make clear which type of immigration is broken IMO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I was hired to scrape some economic related pages and build an excel file and email it, I got that done but not sure if I should try to host this and turn it into a service or just set it up for the client and let them deal with it. It's just personal use on their part. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The problematic part is when you scrape &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; off of websites, and the owners don't want you to do it; as in, they would not even be happy if you manually copied that stuff into an excel file for fun or profit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And in this case websites want to volunteer/agree to index their site for visibility but then you still have to visit the site because conveniently The site summary ends before the content that you want. I don't know how I would find websites unless referred on some website.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I kinda felt the same way about how Netflix started out but I think they probably had a deal to pay a portion of revenue from dvd's that they rented out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;No need to write code, you only need a shell account on a box somewhere. Put a line like this in your crontab:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This will check every three hours during daytime (which is what I wanted). &quot;mailx -E&quot; will only send an email if the input is not empty. Don't forget to define MAILTO and to test the contraption.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I did a very similar thing to check if my H1B was approved. My use case was simpler - I regexp matched a keyword on the webpage and converted the script to an alexa skill deployed locally.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Its broken because it was really intended for exceptionally skilled workers. But currently its a lottery. USCIS just takes the word of the company applying for it and grants the visa. This loophole is being exploited by numerous body shops. That is reason why there are low quality H1B workers. There are various other problems like employee mobility, spouses of H1B is not free to work in the land of the free. Country of birth based quotas for permanent residency, rather than skills or points based quotas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Even allow people to create presets that would then be added as a generic thing. You could use it for camping all sorts of intermittent online things (web site specials, online ticket pre-orders, etc.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During that situation when I missed a slot, I didn't want to take any chances again by using sites like visualping. I trusted my script and twilio API to work.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;First I thought to ring a loud alarm connected with a Pi, but then it will be limited to my apartment. So I went with twilio to give me a phone call. Because I should act immediately and time was of the essence. Emails or SMS might go unnoticed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The problem with monetizing this service is because there are many immigration watsapp groups with many members in it. So when one member buys this service, he can simply broadcast this notification to his watsapp groups. I even made the service free, but no takers. Anyways it worked for me, changed my life !&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My girlfriend needed to be texted everyday otherwise she would turn sour. So I made an sms generator that randomly composed sentences combining words from three tables and sent to her at random times. It took her many months to notice. When she found out, she was angry for 10 seconds, but that anger faded to curiosity about how the random sentence composer thing worked. After I showed it to her, she got mad at me again for not updating the tables more frequently :P&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;How it functions is a daily yes/no vote that triggers a watering event for that day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Edit: Oh, but to I think the real question -- No. It's not my plant anymore as far as I'm concerned. The community can care for it as they see fit. I won't interfere, except to add features, or put up seasonal decorations :) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My former spouse wouldn't answer the home phone when I talked with the kids during the divorce. I wrote an app that texted her and logged the attempt for reporting to the guardian ad litem.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. She also wouldn't answer the door when during kids pick-up. The same app texted her when I was outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. To disprove her allegations I wasn't involved in the kids school and activities I used Android's Locale app to trigger geofenced log entries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Python and Matplotlib came in quite handy automating timeline generation from PDF docs. Never got that one quite perfect though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure I could have prevailed in getting more time with my kids without the time savings automation gave me. I've seen other fathers stopped cold in Court who were less prepared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;23.905362776025&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I have a system built on top of Calibre's &quot;recipe&quot; scripts which scans a set of RSS feeds every day at 3am for new articles, scrapes and cleans the full content where necessary, bundles them into .mobi ebooks, and sends them to my Kindle's email address. Amazon's network wirelessly delivers them overnight, and I wake up in the morning with a fresh batch of reading material. It's like a personalized newspaper subscription.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Similarly, I have a self-hosted instance of Tiny Tiny RSS set up with an array of custom scraping plugins to pull all the web comics I follow into one feed, which I consume with the Android client. I'd push this through my Kindle delivery system, but then I'd be stuck reading black-and-white versions of color comics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Along the same lines, there are a few YouTube channels I subscribe to whose content can be enjoyed nearly as well in audio-only form. As a university student, I do a lot of walking most days to get from place to place, and I fill that time listening to audio content. The same server which runs my news- and comic-gathering systems also watches those YouTube channels, pulls down new videos, converts them to audio, and publishes the results as podcast feeds which I can subscribe to through Pocket Casts on my phone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I wonder how effective it is though these days, I'd say 70% of my RSS feeds are either truncated forms of a full article (with a 'click here to continue reading!' link), or just summaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It would be nice to find a way to share this work, but the variety of tools used often make the customizations too custom (or maybe this is just the most common reason why creators feel there is no reason to share?).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Is anyone aware of any repositories where the customization required to obtain the important content is maintained by a community? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ideas fail completely if too many people start doing the same thing. Actual examples from people on this list:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User pokes immigration website repeatedly to submit his application as soon as the site starts accepting. Obviously if everyone did the same thing, no one would benefit. The thing that needs fixing is an immigration system based (partly on) quotas and first come, first serve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User automates sending amorous messages to his girlfriend, so long as she doesn't know they're automated. If enough people did it, girlfriends would eventually find out and the desired effect would be lost (or worse, they'd feel tricked).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User automates saving of all store coupons to his loyalty card without ever looking at the coupon. This defeats the idea of coupons (to encourage you to try something you would not have otherwise bought). If everyone did it, coupons would cease to exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User automates getting into desired university class by hammering the registration site repeatedly. Needless to say, if everyone started doing the same thing, no one would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User automated complaining to the water utility about a problem in front of his house. Once again, it might work for one person, but becomes completely ineffective if everyone does it for problems in front of their houses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- User automated late delivery complaints to post office to get compensation. If his script becomes too widely used, the monopoly post office will simply raise prices or stop offering compensation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This defeats the idea of coupons (to encourage you to try something you would not have otherwise bought). If everyone did it, coupons would cease to exist.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That sounds like success to me, though not everyone will agree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; - User automates getting into desired university class by hammering the registration site repeatedly. Needless to say, if everyone started doing the same thing, no one would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This was circumventing a bad process; people &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; benefit if everyone did it, because it would demonstrate a need for a better process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; - User automated complaining to the water utility about a problem in front of his house. Once again, it might work for one person, but becomes completely ineffective if everyone does it for problems in front of their houses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If everyone does it then perhaps they’ll fix things—or admit defeat and stop giving people false hope by allowing them to report such things when they have no intention of doing anything about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; - User automated late delivery complaints to post office to get compensation. If his script becomes too widely used, the monopoly post office will simply raise prices or stop offering compensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Or, just &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt;, fix it. One can always hope. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; having coupons/loyalty cards is a good thing. Hammering the immigration website, hammering the university website etc might end up improving the process (hopefully?) that is also a good thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That is true, but I don't think anyone is claiming to make the world better. The question was more how individuals improve their situation, gaining a competitive edge if you will. That will always come at the cost of others, but in this case the hacks are really things almost anyone can do, so it's hard to object on moral grounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I started an escape room business for fun, and have been enjoying the heck out of writing custom software for the rooms. Both in-room and for administration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My favorite is a javascript &quot;OS&quot; that I use to put imaginary windowed environments in the room, but the players never actually leave a full-screen browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It does full window management and all the regular UI stuff so it feels super normal to the players. My favorite part is that I don't use jQuery. That was just a little challenge I created for myself for fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Now my rooms have a login prompt of any kind, and I can then create windows with any kind of HTML/JS/CSS content for solving puzzles, extra clues, etc. I can use an RPi and control maglocks from the computer, light up LED's, or even communicate with wireless props.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I run a kiosk add-on for the browser and physically hack the keyboards so certain keys don't even work in the rooms. No F11 or Ctrl-Alt-Del without access to the netbooks or RPi's locked away in hidden compartments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I also created a lot of room management software for timers, sending hints into the rooms on tablets, etc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;20.90599820949&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I used Python to automate generating a chronological email/sms/phone contact archive when a home renovation project went wrong. My builder made a bunch of mistakes, tried to fob me off with excuses, and then pretended everything was ok. This integrated log was invaluable in showing discrepancies between what he said at the time and what he subsequently claimed.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My Python script reads my Google Contacts csv extract to identify relevant people, the lxml library parses my mobile phone call and sms logs, the mailbox module reads my email inbox and Sent Items to extract relevant messages, PIL resizes attached images. Then I use docx to reassemble the results chronologically into a Word document suitable for submitting in court proceedings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The resulting Word document is an intimidating 130 pages long. I have shown my builder enough excerpts for him to accept liability for most defects. I won a County Court judgment against him last week. Now for the financial settlement!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I thought about putting my script up on github, though haven't had time to scrub some personal information from the source code... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I know of a homeowner that informed his contractor(s) that he blogs daily about the progress of his renovation.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Man, this is awesome. Now that Firefox has become so vastly better than Chrome (who would have expected that a year ago?) you should port it to Firefox too.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The new Firefox is actually faster than Chrome, on my PCs. Plus of course the mobile version actually supports adblockers. I'm switching back to Firefox, personally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Thanks for sharing. I tried it out and it looks great. I had a couple issues. Firstly it has me sign into my Google account on a browser window with no address bar. The only way I could actually verify that it wasn't a fishing site was to use the dev tools. After that it signed me out after a few hours. Hope this helps.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I tried but can't (same thoughts as you, without verifying it myself, not gonna sign in...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;8.9415584415584&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For that I use Anki with the Chinese Support plugin, which is honestly pretty great. It does not only have characters and translation, but also pronunciation both as Pinyin (I think other romanizations can be configured) and audio (which plays on review, great for training your ear and checking your pronunciation), as well as measure words and characters in the opposite set (simplified vs traditional). And it can fill all of those automatically. Then there's stuff built-in to Anki, like statistics that let me know I've learned precisely 2521 unique characters in total, which is great for motivation. (&lt;em&gt;The numbers must go up!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I guess you will want to keep using your homegrown program, but maybe this can give you some inspiration for features to implement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. I have a script to automatically buy small amount of BTC every day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. For the more knowledge-dense books I read, I write summaries of them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://piszek.com/books/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://piszek.com/books/&lt;/a&gt;). I have a script that puts a random book review to my pocket for reviewing every week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. I have an instagram account of lego minifig (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/le.traveller/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/le.traveller/&lt;/a&gt;). I wrote a script that likes other profiles to get traffic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. I have a script that parses my bank e-mail statements to fill up my spending spraedsheets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5. I also have a script that parses incoming email for invoices. That system basically does my taxes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;6. My GTD methodology revolves around Evernote. I have cron jobs that throw me &quot;checklists&quot; with stuff to do around certain times (yearly taxes, etc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;7. Using Twilio and verified number, my calendar sends personalized SMS with birthday wishes to my family that appear as they are from my number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;8. Also on Twilio I have DIY voicemail that is aware of where in world am I and either routes to my current SIM card or takes a message. I also have a US number that routes any SMS to my current SIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I recently moved, so I have to rebuild all my Smart-Home hacks. I am currently trying to automate my Intercom at home to play pre-recorded message to postman and let him in automatically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Registration was at 7am and the site didn't have a queuing mechanism so my wife and I would sit there with two laptops and two tablets hitting F5 repeatedly until we got in. It often took up to an hour to get in, only to find that the programs we wanted were already sold out.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I wrote a script using Selenium WebDriver that would open on multiple windows and keep re-trying until it got in. It would then process the configured list of programs we wanted to register for, find them, add the kid(s) and proceed to the checkout. Manual intervention was required to complete the purchase. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I also wrote a bot that alerts me when 3D printer deals from trusted retailers are going on. I just bought two for $160 each, with free shipping! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There's DRM on the filament and it's PLA only, but you can buy the key to unlock and rewrite the DRM NFC chip. I use an app on my phone to rewrite the values &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I call it DRM because you can't edit it without a reverse engineered NFC key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Another side to the DRM thing is that if you use inferior input material and the printer has a quality issue, customers are going to blame the printer and not the filament.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;These printers are nice to prototype with before sending it to a more costly and less time investment forgiving production printer, or quick around the house jobs/play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I captured video input with a simple python+QT script and emitted a button-press whenever the screen flashed. The best part was that the script didn't interfere with my controller - I could run around the area opening chests and battling random encounters, all the while getting closer to the 100-contiguous-dodges prize!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  * Trial and error (put cereal in a jar and loosen the lid slightly, put milk in a tiny jug at the bottom of the fridge)

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;24.571890145396&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I wrote a bot to read the top article titles and comments (10 articles at a time) on Hacker News and it just runs every hour. Plays out loud on my speakers. Uses a rapsberry pi, python and AWS Polly, I put the code up on github if anyone is interested. The voice kind of gets monotonous but I've found Kendra's voice to be the best IMO.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Last edit: since the free tier has a 5 million character per month limit (AWS Polly) I wrote the script to check if my one desktop IP is connected and if so it can run as I'm not always home/desktop off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So I can keep working and when it plays I pause my music and listen to it. Takes about 20 seconds to do the 10 requests limited to 1500 characters per audio file/synth request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Edit: to be clear you don't need a raspberry pi, just a computer with web connection, runs python, with audio output and scheduler eg. cron.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I just have a raspberry pi webserver at home that is always on, also does other stuff like measure a solar cell's voltage every 10 minutes. It doesn't do anything useful at this time just gathering data and plotting it on a site/working with ADCs/building web API to receive data (want to make it world wide).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The grocery chain I shop at has a component of their loyalty card that lets you add certain coupons to your card and they change constantly. All told there may be a few hundred of items offered up daily, most of which I don't buy anyhow. So instead of wasting my time sifting through them to save $10 a month I just wrote a script to add all of them to my card every day at the same time. So long as I go shopping after that time I may have discounts for items I actually purchase deducted at checkout.&lt;/span&gt;

I'd input the potentially-full classes I'd like to register for, and it would just hammer the registration site repeatedly until someone removed themselves from the class at which point I'd be registered. I'm still amazed IT didn't pull the network connection to my dorm room or have any kind of rate limiting.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.935972060536&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Similarly the college I attended required a five or six (can't remember now) digit number required for access to class registration. The idea was that you would talk to your advisor beforehand so you didn't sign up for the wrong thing I guess. My advisor seemed to be pretty uninterested in meeting with me over email (never responded to multiple attempts), so I gave up and brute forced it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Class registration was done by most with the web interface, but I opted to connect to the backing mainframe via a 3270 terminal emulator. Doing so allowed me to write a simple expect script passing in an increasing number as fast as the connection would allow. I didn't bother with rate limiting and am surprised nobody noticed. Took me about 30 minutes and I was in! I was able to use that script at least twice and I wished I had thought of writing it sooner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Also keep in mind that usually in the US, college students can sign up for any class as long as it doesn't have specific prerequisites - at large schools that means you'd be able to take just about any intro-level class you wanted to, regardless of your major. I'm not sure it works like that in the UK.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We have a module system, and depending on their topic people have some freedom to pick courses outside their main degree during their first 2 years. (We do 4 years, not 3). I did a module on Philosophy of Science during my Computer Science degree, for instance - pretty interesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That said, I haven't heard people complain about classes being full in the same way that they seem to in the USA. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I was in science not arts and there were very few overly popular science classes :-) But across the whole uni, I only heard of a few classes that were so popular they were turning people away. I think one of them prioritised by who was doing that course as their main degree. But I generally heard of very few conflicts, so I don't know what was different. Maybe arts students have a different story? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ah in the UK each class only runs once a year, and everyone supposed to do that class just all does it together at the same time. If there are electives each elective can take any number of people up to the total number on the course. So no need to compete for places.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15454786&quot; readability=&quot;11.455621301775&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.887063655031&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's not that the schools enroll more than they can teach. One simple reason is that many classes are just very popular, word gets around that they are great for whichever reason (professor, easy A, really fun project, etc). If a class can only hold 20 people, and its a popular class, its going to fill up as soon as registration opens.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In the end, you aren't left without being able to take classes. Just possibly not the ones you wanted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I doubt this isn't the case in the UK too &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In the UK you start a degree as a group and do all the same classes all at the same time as your peers. If you have a choice of classes then each of those choices can accommodate the whole group at the same time if everyone chose it, so classes just can’t be too full. At least this was the case at both use UK universities I’ve been to.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1 req every 30 seconds is more or less invisible, and universities have comparatively small customer bases. If everyone was doing it, there might be a problem.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My university does require a cooldown period. I heard that someone made his course registration script available to everyone, which I guess was a problem. Unfortunately, the detection system triggers even when you're just manually clicking through the site, which is annoying.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Depression Thing</title>
<link>http://zachholman.com/posts/the-depression-thing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://zachholman.com/posts/the-depression-thing</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m burying the lede here a bit, but ledes are for real journalists, pffft. The reason why I’m writing about all of this is the same reason I write about anything: this is a very important aspect of my life, and I think it can help others. So I talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not depressed? Cool, I’m happy for you; I truly am. But you know someone who is. In fact, you know a lot of people who are. And once you include people coping with mental disorders, you realize that goddamn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics&quot;&gt;there are a lot of people&lt;/a&gt; who could be better off if they could get help. Pretty much everyone would see some benefit from seeing a therapist at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stigma is real, of course. I’m still a little nervous about hitting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; button on this one, even though I’ve never shied away from controversial posts in the past. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://zachholman.com/posts/javacript-haters&quot;&gt;A post about enjoying JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; is probably about the most controversial you can get, after all. I still get hate mail from that one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zachholman.com/posts/start-up-your-startup&quot;&gt;I started a startup&lt;/a&gt; this year and, though it’s been going slower than I’d like since it’s a solo venture so far and I’ve been primarily focused on fixing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; first, I realize that posting this might make some investors balk at giving me money, if I do ever decide to seek funding. This isn’t necessarily surprising, since the venture capital industry doesn’t have exactly have a sterling track record when it comes to being empathetic. Or even like, acting like a human being. But it’s not just them, of course; people I hire down the line, people I work with, business partners, hell, even some friends might even kind of subconsciously feel funny reading about this stuff and think about me different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, I obviously think it’s worth talking about. People act so weirdly when it comes to this stuff, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we don’t talk about it, even today, in 2017. Fuck flying cars and laser guns, I want transparent discussion of mental problems in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the weird things I realized throughout this whole process is &lt;em&gt;how different&lt;/em&gt; people react with this. Some friends truly get it, and are fantastic resources for you to talk to. Some just don’t. I reached out to some of my closest friends and struck out (“get out of here with this shit, Holman, you’re fine”). I’ve alluded about it to other distant friends (some of which I didn’t previously even think of as a “friend”) and found myself in an immediate boat load of compassionate support. I’ve seen everything in between. Some people get it, some people don’t. (And it turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/extremely-positive-people-overestimate-their-ability-to-empathize&quot;&gt;very happy people might really never really understand&lt;/a&gt;.) I think a huge part of it is whether they’ve experienced it themselves, or, barring that, if they’ve ever had a close friend or partner go through this. It’s truly night and day between the two extremes, and you don’t always have to seek your best friends out and lean on them for support. Support comes from a lot of people; if you drop the ball, you might be surprised at who helps you pick it back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You actually need to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something to get out of the hole that you’re in. Don’t worry; I’m not giving you the “run a mile, you’ll feel great!” advice. If you do something proactive, like seeing a therapist, or trying medication, or making major life changes that avoid things that make you feel shitty, great. If it’s something less proactive, like opening yourself up to a friend who’s interested in helping you make those first steps, then do that too. You can do some of these yourself, and some things you can allow yourself to be selfish and let someone help you. They’re out there. They want to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice and write down the achievements you actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; achieve. Keep a journal, or at the very least, keep a running todo list where you can check off even the basic things, like “clean my desk”. At the end of the day, you help yourself by seeing what you actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes doing the small things helps you start on doing the big things. My depression always prevented me from starting things, and from seeing what I did. That sucked, and was a self-defeating cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help others seek help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this primarily for people who are dealing with depression, but secondarily I’m writing it for you, the person who doesn’t have to cope with these feelings on a day-to-day basis, but who doesn’t really know how to help someone. A little bit of context goes a long way. You might feel unprepared to fix a friend’s problems, but you can do the leg work for them. Find a local therapist in their neighborhood that works with their insurance (if they’re an American like me, that is, otherwise just go have a health insurance party if you’re in other countries, you lucky bastards). Or just listen. Listening helps a lot, even if they don’t actually listen to you. Years ago, when I was at one of my worsts, two friends went way out of their way and came to my house to check on me. I didn’t really show them much gratefulness back then, but goddamn, that’s a debt that I still won’t ever be able to repay. The little things count. If not today, then they’ll count tomorrow, I promise you that.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ansible open-sources Ansible Tower with AWX</title>
<link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/ansible-open-sources-ansible-tower-awx</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/ansible-open-sources-ansible-tower-awx</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since Red Hat acquired Ansible, I and many others have anticipated whether or when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/tower&quot;&gt;Ansible Tower&lt;/a&gt; would be open sourced. Ansible Tower is one of the nicest automation tools I've used... but since I haven't been on a project with the budget to support the Tower licensing fees, I have only used it for testing small-scale projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a guide for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/automating-your-automation-ansible-tower&quot;&gt;Automating your Automation with Ansible Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and it's both on the web and in Chapter 11 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansiblefordevops.com&quot;&gt;Ansible for DevOps&lt;/a&gt;, and in the guide, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller teams, especially when everyone on the team is well-versed in how to use Ansible, YAML syntax, and follows security best practices with playbooks and variables files, using the CLI can be a sustainable approach... Ansible Tower provides a great mechanism for team-based Ansible usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of companies (mine included!) using Jenkins as a substitute for Ansible Tower, and this can work pretty well, but Jenkins doesn't integrate deeply with all Ansible's powerful inventory management, secret management, and playbook management. Tower also supports a lot more flexible authentication and role-based playbook permissions model which makes it a perfect fit for team-based playbook management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear though, &lt;em&gt;Ansible Tower&lt;/em&gt; itself will still be a licensed product offering from Red Hat, but the &lt;em&gt;code that builds Ansible Tower releases&lt;/em&gt; is open sourced, and is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ansible/awx&quot;&gt;AWX Project&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/awx-project-faq&quot;&gt;AWX Project FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the best way to think of this open source model is in the analogy Fedora is to Red Hat Enterprise Linux as AWX is to Ansible Tower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWX is designed to be a frequently released, fast-moving project where all new development happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible Tower is produced by taking selected releases of AWX, hardening them for long-term supportability, and making them available to customers as the Ansible Tower offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tested and trusted method of software development for Red Hat, which follows a similar model to Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to see the code behind Tower has finally been open sourced via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ansible/awx&quot;&gt;AWX&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope to start using it for a few services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://hostedapachesolr.com&quot;&gt;Hosted Apache Solr&lt;/a&gt; shortly. I'll be updating my book's chapter on Ansible Tower and AWX as soon as I'm able—and if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops&quot;&gt;buy the book on LeanPub&lt;/a&gt;, you'll get that updated content for free, as soon as I finish writing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with AWX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Run the two commands below to run my AWX Docker images, then access http://localhost/ after your CPU calms down, and enter username &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and password &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/awx-container/master/docker-compose.yml&lt;br/&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/awx-shell-script-install.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; alt=&quot;Install AWX using a script Ansible&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Docker's not your thing, I'm also maintaining an AWX example in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples&quot;&gt;Ansible Vagrant Examples&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repository. Read through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples/tree/master/awx&quot;&gt;the AWX example README file&lt;/a&gt; for instructions in getting everything set up, and follow the project's issue tracker for further development of the example (I'm working to make it run in more environments, more easily!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.7522935779817&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also building an &lt;a href=&quot;https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/awx/&quot;&gt;Ansible AWX role on Ansible Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; (which is used by the Vagrant example); it's still in a pretty early stage, but should work okay. I'll hopefully get time to optimize it more in the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you install it, you'll be greeted by this angry potato:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/awx-login-screen-default.jpg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; alt=&quot;Ansible AWX login screen angry potato&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in with the credentials &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's up with the name 'AWX'?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Ansible Tower was called &quot;AWX&quot; — see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/blog/2013/08/05/supercharge-ansible-with-ansibleworks-awx-1-2&quot;&gt;this old blog post&lt;/a&gt; from 2013. And apparently that was kind of a short-hand for 'AnsibleWorks', &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/blog/2013/03/04/introducing-ansibleworks&quot;&gt;the original name of the company&lt;/a&gt; that became Ansible, that became Ansible by Red Hat. Straight from the horse's mouth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.0957446808511&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Loosely &quot;ansibleworks&quot;. But nothing really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ansible for DevOps discounted during AnsibleFest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops/c/2I2Wgy6kiEFS&quot;&gt;Ansible for DevOps is 25% off in celebration of AnsibleFest&lt;/a&gt;, so pick up a copy today and supercharge your automation with Ansible!&lt;/p&gt;
