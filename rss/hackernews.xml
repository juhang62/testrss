<title>Samsung Announces Key-Value SSD Prototype</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/14839/samsung-announces-standardscompliant-keyvalue-ssd-prototype</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/14839/samsung-announces-standardscompliant-keyvalue-ssd-prototype</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Samsung has announced a new prototype key-value SSD that is compatible with the first industry standard API for key-value storage devices. Earlier this year, the Object Drives working group of Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) published version 1.0 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/kvsapi&quot;&gt;Key Value Storage API Specification&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung has added support for this new API to their ongoing key-value SSD project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most hard drives and SSDs expose their storage capacity through a block storage interface, where the drive stores blocks of a fixed size (typically 512 bytes or 4kB) and they are identified by Logical Block Addresses that are usually 48 or 64 bits. Key-value drives extend that model so that a drive can support variable-sized keys instead of fixed-sized LBAs, and variable-sized values instead of fixed 512B or 4kB blocks. This allows a key-value drive to be used more or less as a drop-in replacement for software key-value databases like RocksDB, and as a backend for applications built atop key-value databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key-value SSDs have the potential to offload significant work from a server's CPUs when used to replace a software-based key-value database. More importantly, moving the key-value interface into the SSD itself means it can be tightly integrated with the SSD's flash translation layer, cutting out the overhead of emulating a block storage device and layering a variable-sized storage system on top of that. This means key-value SSDs can operate with much lower write amplification and higher performance than software key-value databases, with only one layer of garbage collection in the stack instead of one in the SSD and one in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has been working on key-value SSDs for quite a while, and they have been publicly developing open-source software to support KV SSDs for over a year, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenMPDK/KVSSD&quot;&gt;the basic libraries and drivers&lt;/a&gt; needed to access KV SSDs as well as a sample benchmarking tool and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenMPDK/KVCeph&quot;&gt;a Ceph backend&lt;/a&gt;. The prototype drives they have previously discussed have been based on their PM983 datacenter NVMe drives with TLC NAND, using custom firmware to enable the key-value interface. Those drives support key lengths from 4 to 255 bytes and value lengths up to 2MB, and it is likely that Samsung's new prototype is based on the same hardware platform and retains similar size limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung's Platform Development Kit software for key-value SSDs originally supported their own software API, but now additionally supports the vendor-neutral SNIA standard API. The prototype drives are currently available for companies that are interested in developing software to use KV SSDs. Samsung's KV SSDs probably will not move from prototype status to being mass production products until after the corresponding key-value command set extension to NVMe is finalized, so that KV SSDs can be supported without needing a custom NVMe driver. The SNIA standard API for key-value drives is a high-level transport-agnostic API that can support drives using NVMe, SAS or SATA interfaces, but each of those protocols needs to be extended with key-value support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A critique of the claim that passive investing is a bubble</title>
<link>https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I received a number of questions about this headline and story from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-27375&quot; src=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-223642.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;808&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-223642.jpg 1147w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-223642-300x130.jpg 300w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-223642-768x333.jpg 768w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-223642-1024x445.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stuff scares people because it’s coming from an intelligent investor who made a name for himself during one of the biggest market crashes of all-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even the best investors are too smart for their own good when it comes to understanding the simpler parts of the investing world. Here’s legendary hedge fund investor Seth Klarman’s take on index funds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe that indexing will turn out to be just another Wall Street fad. When it passes, the prices of securities included in popular indexes will almost certainly decline relative to those that have been excluded. More significantly, as Barron’s has pointed out, “A self-reinforcing feedback loop has been created, where the success of indexing has bolstered the performance of the index itself, which, in turn promotes more indexing.” When the market trend reverses, matching the market will not seem so attractive, the selling will then adversely affect the performance of the indexers and further exacerbate the rush for the exits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too sounds scary. The problem is Klarman wrote this in his book, &lt;em&gt;Margin of Safety, &lt;/em&gt;published in 1991.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get questions about the potential for a passive bubble on a regular basis so I figured it was time to put all my thoughts on the topic in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indexing is an odd risk to worry about. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s bizarre that some people think it’s a bad thing investors are shifting money into funds that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;save them money in fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are more tax-efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have lower turnover and trading costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beat the majority of actively managed funds over the long-term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are simpler and easier to understand than most investment strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also bizarre to blame a bubble on the idea that more investors are actively avoiding the search for alpha by thinking and acting for the long-term. It’s like worrying about a trend where everyone decides to eat better, thus hurting sales at McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2015/09/index-funds-are-nothing-special/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Index funds are nothing special&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wouldn’t it be more worrisome if investors were piling into funds with high fees that are tax inefficient that also trade a lot and underperform simple market averages over time?&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tail is not wagging the dog. &lt;/strong&gt;The fund world of mutual funds and ETFs is all most investors know these days but ownership of the stock market goes far beyond this world (h/t &lt;a href=&quot;https://theetfeducator.com/2019/08/14/etf-fear-mongering/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nate Geraci&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-27368&quot; src=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-220027.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; srcset=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-220027.jpg 1050w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-220027-300x221.jpg 300w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-220027-768x566.jpg 768w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-04-220027-1024x755.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the breakdown from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119404304/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1119404304&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aweaofcomsen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e6c600b211c8aa9795d0766e0a268798&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;John Bogle’s final book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, U.S. index funds have grown to huge size, with their holdings of U.S. stocks doubling from 3.3% of their total market value in 2002, to 6.8% in 2009, and then doubling again to an estimated 14% in 2018. Other mutual funds now hold an estimated 20% of corporate shares, bringing the mutual fund total to almost 35%, the nation’s most dominant single holder of common stocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So index funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies. And according to former &lt;a href=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/01/great-to-see-you-active-management-are-you-still-alive/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/01/great-to-see-you-active-management-are-you-still-alive/&quot;&gt;Vanguard CEO Bill McNabb&lt;/a&gt;, indexing in stocks and bonds globally represents less than 5% of global assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why aren’t people more worried active managers are going to lead to a crash someday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmark huggers have always been around. &lt;/strong&gt;Vanguard and iShares have experienced massive growth in the past 10-20 years, seeing trillions of dollars of inflows. But this doesn’t mean indexing is new. It’s just in a cheaper wrapper now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional money managers have been closely tracking their benchmarks for decades now. That’s because those indexes are their benchmarks. Very few actively managed funds deviate much from those benchmarks because being different eventually leads to underperformance, which can lead these managers to get fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career risk may be one of the greatest inefficiencies people never talk about but it’s there. And because career risk has always existed, closet indexing has been around for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus there’s the fact that pensions and other large institutional investors have been creating their own index funds in-house using separately managed funds for years. We’re just seeing a shift from closet indexing to ETFs and other index funds en masse now that investors have wisened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it a good thing investors are shifting away from expensive closet index funds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active funds literally own the market. &lt;/strong&gt;When you buy an index fund of the total stock market, you are literally buying the stock market in proportion to the shares held by all active investors. If you sum up the collective holdings of active managers, what you basically get is a market-cap-weighted index. Index fund investors are simply buying what the active investors have laid out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus we have to remember that not every cent flowing into index funds is going directly to the S&amp;amp;P 500 or a total market fund. Most of the money is going there but there are also index funds for small caps, mid caps, value, growth, sectors, themes, and everything in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the worries about indexing really boil down to career risk in the asset management space. By taking themselves out of the game and buying index funds, there are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2015/12/fewer-suckers-at-the-poker-table/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;fewer suckers at the poker table&lt;/a&gt; for the pros to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it a good thing most small investors have decided they can’t compete with the professional active managers who trade with one another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price discovery is a cop-out. &lt;/strong&gt;Active management will never completely go out of business because it’s far too lucrative and tempting for type-A personalities to prove themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people worry that as index funds continue to gain market share, the price discovery mechanism could become fragile. This is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of price discovery going on in the markets. In fact, you could probably make the case there’s too much of it these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago or so, the entire New York Stock Exchange saw trading volume for all listed stocks of 3 million shares. Today, Apple has an average trading volume of roughly 26 million shares a day. Facebook turns over more than 16 million shares a day, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the biggest stock market ETF (SPY) averages nearly 70 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; trades a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active managers will &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;set the prices, no matter how many there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charley Ellis wrote in his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119313074/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1119313074&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aweaofcomsen-20&amp;amp;linkId=8cec630b1bd27f075036ff983b17c831&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Index Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;that indexing accounts for less than 5% of trading, with the remaining 95% or so done by active investors. This will always be the case, no matter the amount of money flowing into index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2018/07/31/making-a-market/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NYSE volume by year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-27393&quot; src=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-094356.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;736&quot; height=&quot;599&quot; srcset=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-094356.jpg 736w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-094356-300x244.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not complaining about the increase in volume. This is a good thing because it lowers trading costs and decreases bid/ask spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s a more worrisome trend for individual investors — people who have decided to trade less or people who have decided to trade more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, index funds are free-riders but so what?&lt;/strong&gt; Cliff Asness wrote a wonderful piece for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-02/indexing-is-capitalism-at-its-best&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago about the idea of index investors being free riders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of price signals by those who played no role in setting them may be capitalism’s most important feature. That most of us and most of our dollars don’t have to pick stocks, or to price air conditioners, is a great benefit and taking advantage of it makes us honest smart capitalists, not commissars.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, index investors are free riders, but this is the way most markets work. We don’t go to the grocery store to bid on prices of oranges against one another to set an equilibrium. The market does that for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really think every investor in the market has the ability to accurately set prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s room for both.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also worth pointing out the success of indexing doesn’t mean all active management is useless or bad. In fact, Vanguard itself still a ton of money in active funds. Here’s the breakdown of assets in index funds for the firm (also from Bogle’s book):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-27396&quot; src=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-095559.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;532&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-095559.jpg 532w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-095559-300x217.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend is easy to spot but the firm still has more than $1 trillion in actively managed funds. They just happen to manage their active funds using strategies that employ low turnover, long holding periods, and lower than average fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Won’t it be a net positive for the end investor that indexing will force the asset management industry to adapt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity is not a huge problem for index funds.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;But, Ben, w&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hat if everyone rushes to the exits all at once? Index funds and ETFs are going to cause a massive crash!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an index fund investor sells, they’re technically selling their holdings in direct proportion to their weighting in the index. So there is little market impact involved. Again, index fund investors are simply owning stocks in the proportion that all active investors own stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, index funds never lever up your holdings. They never receive a margin call. They don’t put 30% of your holdings in Valeant Pharmaceuticals. And no index fund has ever closed up shop to spend more time with their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be investors that panic, regardless of the type of fund they’re invested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would index funds or ETFs be any different than any other fund type or security in that respect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans matter more than fund structures. &lt;/strong&gt;People love attaching a narrative to what transpires in the markets. Index funds have been the perfect scapegoat in a market that has gone up for 10 years and pretty much outperformed every other strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won’t last forever but the next time the market crashes will have more to do with investors than index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what didn’t cause the Great Depression or Japan stock market crash or 1987 crash or 1973-74 bear market? Index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index funds also weren’t around for the South Sea bubble in the 1700s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what did cause these bubbles and subsequent crashes? Human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the stock market itself become a bubble yet again? Of course. There will always be bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are index funds perfect? No. They give you all of the upside of the stock market but also all of the downside. And indexes can go nowhere for years on end just like individual stocks. They can become overpriced and underpriced. They own the good stocks and the bad stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s nothing new. That’s the stock market for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passive bubble talk is silly. Wake me up when index funds control 90% of the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Nathan Sharp, Product Manager, Facebook Dating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Dating makes it easier to find love through what you like — helping you start meaningful relationships through things you have in common, like interests, events and groups. It takes the work out of creating a dating profile and gives you a more authentic look at who someone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re launching Facebook Dating in the US. We’re also giving people the ability to integrate their Instagram posts directly into their Facebook Dating profile and giving people the ability to add Instagram followers to their Secret Crush lists, in addition to Facebook friends. By the end of the year, we’ll make it possible to add Facebook and Instagram Stories to your Dating profile too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a romantic partner is deeply personal, which is why we built Dating to be safe, inclusive and opt-in. Safety, security and privacy are at the forefront of this product. We worked with experts in these areas to build protections into Facebook Dating from the start, including the ability to report and block anyone; prohibiting people from sending photos, links, payments or videos in messages; and by providing easy access to safety tips. These features and others give you more control and peace of mind. Learn more about privacy and Facebook Dating &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-matters-dating/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can choose to opt into Facebook Dating and create a Dating profile (separate from your main profile) if you’re 18 years or older and have downloaded the most recent version of Facebook. You will be suggested to others who have also opted in. People are suggested based on your preferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook. Facebook Dating isn’t about swiping or having to wait for someone to like you to get a first chance at reaching out. If you are interested in someone, you can comment directly on their profile or tap on the Like button to let them know. If you aren’t interested, you can pass on them. Facebook Dating allows you to match with friends of friends and/or people not in your friend circle. Facebook Dating won’t match you with friends, unless you choose to use Secret Crush and you both add each other to your list. All of your Dating activity will stay in Facebook Dating. It won’t be shared to the rest of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People will soon be able to connect and share with Facebook and Instagram Stories. &lt;/strong&gt;Today people are asked to make a decision as to whether or not they like someone immediately based on a static profile. To help you show, rather than tell, who you are, we’re bringing Stories to Dating. This format lets you be authentic in a way that a typical dating profile can’t, and it helps you get to know someone before and after you match.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-16330&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Concept only. Not final design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret Crush lets you match with people you already know on Facebook and/or Instagram. &lt;/strong&gt;By default, Facebook Dating won’t match you with your Facebook Friends, but people told us they were interested in exploring potential romantic relationships within their extended circles, like their Facebook friend list and Instagram followers. Our popular Secret Crush feature gives you the option to do just that. If you choose to use Secret Crush, you can select up to nine of your Facebook friends or Instagram followers who you’re interested in. (To add Instagram followers you must connect your Instagram account to Facebook Dating.) If your crush has opted into Facebook Dating, they’ll get a notification saying that someone has a crush on them. If your crush adds you to their Secret Crush list too, it’s a match! If your crush isn’t on Dating, doesn’t create a Secret Crush list, or doesn’t put you on their list — then no one will know that you’ve entered their name.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can now add your Instagram posts to your profile in Facebook Dating.&lt;/strong&gt; Adding Instagram posts to your profile will make it easier to build a better dating profile, show aspects of your life to others, and find shared connections that spark conversation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt into Events and Groups to see people with similar interests.&lt;/strong&gt;You can choose to see other people who are using Facebook Dating that fit your preferences within the groups you are part of and the events you have attended or will be attending. When you choose to see these people, you will also be visible to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feel safe by sharing details of your date. &lt;/strong&gt;People using Facebook Dating can share details of their upcoming date and/or live location with someone they trust via Messenger. They will be able to control if they want to choose this feature. If they do, they are in control of who&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they share this information with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating your Dating profile is easier than ever. &lt;/strong&gt;Based on feedback from people using Dating in other countries, we’ve made it easier to create a Facebook Dating profile. With one tap, we’ll suggest photos and information from your Facebook profile, which you can edit or remove.  You can also create your own Dating profile from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the US, Facebook Dating is currently available in 19 other countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam. It will be in Europe by early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

       &lt;p&gt; &lt;em/&gt;WeWork’s parent company is exploring a dramatic reduction in its valuation as it aims to go public while facing widespread skepticism over its business model and corporate governance, according to people familiar with the company’s listing plans and its recent talks with major investors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We Co. is considering putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/what-wework-worth/17F1AB05-4F56-44C5-BAEA-C4C0C935232E?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;a price tag on its initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; that would value the company somewhere in the $20 billion range, potentially at the low end. That is less than half of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-is-valued-10-times-greater-than-this-profitable-public-rival-11566298801?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the $47 billion mark&lt;/a&gt; where it last raised private capital this year, making it one of the largest valuation comedowns in IPO history.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;






       




       &lt;p&gt; 




      Adam Neumann, 




       We’s co-founder and chief executive, flew to Tokyo last week to meet one of the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-lend-founder-and-employees-billions-to-invest-in-fund-11566051247?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;biggest investors&lt;/a&gt;,

       Chief Executive 




      Masayoshi Son, 




       and members of his team. There, they discussed the possibility of an additional infusion of capital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the ideas considered was SoftBank serving as an anchor investor in the IPO by buying a significant portion of the roughly $3 billion to $4 billion the company is expected to raise. The executives also discussed whether SoftBank might invest a chunk of money that would allow We to delay its IPO until 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn’t known whether SoftBank will ultimately put more money into We. Some of the conglomerate’s key investors have previously balked at doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




       &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-raises-additional-capital-from-softbank-11546967337?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;SoftBank committed to invest $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the company at a valuation of around $47 billion. It also spent $1 billion to buy existing shares from We employees and investors at a valuation of around $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since We &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-ipo-filing-reveals-huge-revenue-and-losses-11565783212?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;unveiled the papers for its IPO&lt;/a&gt; last month, potential investors have raised concerns with the company and its underwriters about We’s steep losses, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of real-estate deals and past personal loans involving the firm and Mr. Neumann. They have also balked at valuations anywhere near the $47 billion mark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That harsh reception has been a surprising wake-up call for We executives. Because of that, We and its underwriters have considered raising money at a much lower price tag than initially expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We had been planning to debut in September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-aims-to-go-public-in-september-sooner-than-expected-sources-11563921401?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, which was earlier than many investors anticipated. But the situation remains fluid, and We could still start its roadshow to pitch potential investors on the IPO as soon as Monday. The company hasn’t yet chosen an exchange on which to list its shares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some investors have questioned how We will hold up if the economy slows down, something many fear is likely in the coming year. Complicating matters, the stock market We would jump into has been volatile as investors contend with uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade war.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;Some existing investors, aware of potential public buyers’ wariness toward We, have advocated shelving the IPO until next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard no bullish views at all,” said 




      Rett Wallace, 




       chief executive of Triton Research, which analyzes pre-IPO companies for investors. “There were Uber bulls, there were Lyft bulls, there were Snap bulls.” He added that “WeWork is exhausting people’s cynicism.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find other venture-backed technology companies during the past decade whose valuations have fallen so steeply at their IPOs, according to a Renaissance Capital analysis. In 2015, mobile payments company 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/SQ&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       priced its market debut at a more-than 50% discount to the company’s last private valuation, at the time among the biggest such trims in recent memory. Digital storage company 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/DBX&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       last year priced its IPO at a valuation of just over $9 billion, less than the $10 billion valuation received in the private market four years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/UBER&quot;&gt;Uber Technologies&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       and 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/PINS&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       each had higher fully diluted valuations at IPO that exceeded those of their last private funding rounds, they still slashed the price on individual shares, said Matt Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital. Uber cut its per-share price by nearly 8% at IPO, and Pinterest dropped its share price by almost 12%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, Uber, 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/LYFT&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       and 






        &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/SNAP&quot;&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       all still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-is-latest-firm-to-flounder-post-ipo-11565366522?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;trade below their IPO prices&lt;/a&gt;, while many other tech startups have seen their valuations soar after listing publicly. Investors hope for big returns on banner-name tech IPOs that they think have serious growth potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But heavy losses have dogged those companies’ stock-price performances, and We has a significant amount of red ink on its own income statement. As it continues to increase spending on areas like sales and marketing, its losses—totaling $1.67 billion for the 12 months ended in June—have been trending in the opposite direction of what companies typically like to show as they head toward public ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 




       &lt;p&gt;We primarily rents long-term space, renovates it, then divides the offices and subleases them short-term to other companies. It has for years baffled landlords and startup investors with its valuation, which has been more akin to that of a software company with limited costs than an office-space provider. IWG PLC—a similar company that has less growth but is profitable—rents a comparable number of desks but has a market capitalization of around $4.6 billion, one-tenth the level at which We was most recently valued. Even before the IPO prospectus was filed, some former executives and current We employees told the Journal they were bracing for a big drop in value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an all-hands meeting with employees Wednesday, Mr. Neumann gave an update on the state of the business and joked that dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the IPO process helped him understand

      Elon Musk, 




       according to people who attended the meeting. Mr. Musk has had high-profile battles with the regulator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If We does begin its roadshow Monday, it would be on track to go public as soon as late September. The company has been talking with underwriters about a September listing or waiting until October so its executives and bankers could spend several additional weeks meeting with investors to keep explaining more aspects of the business. The company could also wait until next year to debut if it raises more capital this year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Enabling developers and organizations to use differential privacy</title>
<link>https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/09/enabling-developers-and-organizations.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/09/enabling-developers-and-organizations.html</guid>
<description>&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Posted by Miguel Guevara, Product Manager, Privacy and Data Protection Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a city planner, a small business owner, or a software developer, gaining useful insights from data can help make services work better and answer important questions. But, without strong privacy protections, you risk losing the trust of your citizens, customers, and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentially-private data analysis is a principled approach that enables organizations to learn from the majority of their data while simultaneously ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified. This type of analysis can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and for many different purposes. For example, if you are a health researcher, you may want to compare the average amount of time patients remain admitted across various hospitals in order to determine if there are differences in care. Differential privacy is a high-assurance, analytic means of ensuring that use cases like this are addressed in a privacy-preserving manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re rolling out the open-source version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/&quot;&gt;differential privacy library&lt;/a&gt; that helps power some of Google’s core products. To make the library easy for developers to use, we’re focusing on features that can be particularly difficult to execute from scratch, like automatically calculating bounds on user contributions. It is now freely available to any organization or developer that wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deeper look at the technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our open source library was designed to meet the needs of developers. In addition to being freely accessible, we wanted it to be easy to deploy and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key features of the library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical functions:&lt;/strong&gt; Most common data science operations are supported by this release. Developers can compute counts, sums, averages, medians, and percentiles using our library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigorous testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting differential privacy right is challenging. Besides an extensive test suite, we’ve included an extensible ‘Stochastic Differential Privacy Model Checker library’ to help prevent mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to use:&lt;/strong&gt; The real utility of an open-source release is in answering the question “Can I use this?” That’s why we’ve included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; extension along with common recipes to get you started. We’ve described the details of our approach in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01917&quot;&gt;technical paper&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve just released today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modular:&lt;/strong&gt; We designed the library so that it can be extended to include other functionalities such as additional mechanisms, aggregation functions, or privacy budget management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in new privacy technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have driven the research and development of practical, differentially-private techniques since we &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2014/10/learning-statistics-with-privacy-aided.html&quot;&gt;released RAPPOR&lt;/a&gt; to help improve Chrome in 2014, and continue to spearhead their real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve used differentially private methods to create helpful features in our products, like how busy a business is over the course of a day or how popular a particular restaurant’s dish is in Google Maps, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/project-fi/its-easier-ever-travel-project-fi/&quot;&gt;improve Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cY23bdQ_B_o/XXA01uQIDnI/AAAAAAAAHzs/TiSL5_tY29QMa7Sehm6VdX6cDjB6cvmrgCLcBGAs/s1600/popular%2Btimes%2B_%2Bdishes%2Bgif.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screen recording on phone checking popular times of restaurant&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1224&quot; data-original-width=&quot;616&quot; id=&quot;imgHalf&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cY23bdQ_B_o/XXA01uQIDnI/AAAAAAAAHzs/TiSL5_tY29QMa7Sehm6VdX6cDjB6cvmrgCLcBGAs/s1600/popular%2Btimes%2B_%2Bdishes%2Bgif.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we’ve announced several open-source, privacy technologies—&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-privacy-learning-with-differential-privacy-for-training-data-b143c5e801b6&quot;&gt;Tensorflow Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-federated-a4147aa20041&quot;&gt;Tensorflow Federated&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/helping-organizations-do-more-without-collecting-more-data.html&quot;&gt;Private Join and Compute&lt;/a&gt;—and today’s launch adds to this growing list. We're excited to make this library broadly available and hope developers will consider leveraging it as they build out their comprehensive data privacy strategies. From medicine, to government, to business, and beyond, it’s our hope that these open-source tools will help produce insights that benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;I've been working remotely for the last 4 years of my life. In my latest company, I just realized how little literature has been written on the topic of remote working. I've been seeing some forms of reports on the status of remote working [0], but I couldn't find any in-depth materials (whether blogs, essays, papers or even books) with some qualitative thinking on remote work and the future of work. We have been flooded with solutions and tools without a deep understand of our working flow and caveats.
&lt;p&gt;Ie: why are things happening in a certain way? What are the school of thoughts? What are the best practices (synchronous vs. asynchronous, remote vs distributed)? What is the Keynes vs. Hayek of the subject? What are the implications of remote working on organizational structures (eg. functional vs. divisional)? What can and cannot work? What's the tool stack one should adapt depending on the org configuration?(Slack + Zoom for sync, etc) How does this should adapt as the org changes over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have specific resources you could recommend me to read on the topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This write-up I just published on the blog is the closest example to what I'm looking for: https://sametab.com/blog/future-remote-working/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[0] https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;

<title>Why Finnish babies sleep in cardboard boxes (2013)</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;For 75 years, Finland's expectant mothers have been given a box by the state. It's like a starter kit of clothes, sheets and toys that can even be used as a bed. And some say it helped Finland achieve one of the world's lowest infant mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s and it's designed to give all children in Finland, no matter what background they're from, an equal start in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maternity package - a gift from the government - is available to all expectant mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products for the baby, as well as nappies, bedding and a small mattress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the mattress in the bottom, the box becomes a baby's first bed. Many children, from all social backgrounds, have their first naps within the safety of the box's four cardboard walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait has-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothers have a choice between taking the box, or a cash grant, currently set at 140 euros, but 95% opt for the box as it's worth much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradition dates back to 1938. To begin with, the scheme was only available to families on low incomes, but that changed in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only was it offered to all mothers-to-be but new legislation meant in order to get the grant, or maternity box, they had to visit a doctor or municipal pre-natal clinic before their fourth month of pregnancy,&quot; says Heidi Liesivesi, who works at Kela - the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the box provided mothers with what they needed to look after their baby, but it also helped steer pregnant women into the arms of the doctors and nurses of Finland's nascent welfare state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s Finland was a poor country and infant mortality was high - 65 out of 1,000 babies died. But the figures improved rapidly in the decades that followed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mika Gissler, a professor at the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, gives several reasons for this - the maternity box and pre-natal care for all women in the 1940s, followed in the 60s by a national health insurance system and the central hospital network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Contents of the box&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner Milla and I were living in London when we had our first child, Jasper, so we weren't eligible for a free box. But Milla's parents didn't want us to miss out, so they bought one and put it in the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't wait to get the lid off. There were all the clothes you would expect, with the addition of a snowsuit for Finland's icy winters. And then the box itself. I had never considered putting my baby to sleep in a cardboard box, but if it's good enough for the majority of Finns, then why not? Jasper slept in it - as you might expect - like a baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now live in Helsinki and have just had our second child, Annika. She did get a free box from the Finnish state. This felt to me like evidence that someone cared, someone wanted our baby to have a good start in life. And now when I visit friends with young children it's nice to see we share some common things. It strengthens that feeling that we are all in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reija Klemetti, a 49-year-old from Helsinki, remembers going to the post office to collect a box for one of her six children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was lovely and exciting to get it and somehow the first promise to the baby,&quot; she says. &quot;My mum, friends and relatives were all eager to see what kind of things were inside and what colours they'd chosen for that year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother-in-law, aged 78, relied heavily on the box when she had the first of her four children in the 60s. At that point she had little idea what she would need, but it was all provided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Klemetti's daughter Solja, aged 23, shared the sense of excitement that her mother had once experienced, when she took possession of the &quot;first substantial thing&quot; prior to the baby itself. She now has two young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's easy to know what year babies were born in, because the clothing in the box changes a little every year. It's nice to compare and think, 'Ah that kid was born in the same year as mine',&quot; says Titta Vayrynen, a 35-year-old mother with two young boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some families, the contents of the box would be unaffordable if they were not free of charge, though for Vayrynen, it was more a question of saving time than money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was working long hours when pregnant with her first child, and was glad to be spared the effort of comparing prices and going out shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a recent report saying that Finnish mums are the happiest in the world, and the box was one thing that came to my mind. We are very well taken care of, even now when some public services have been cut down a little,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she had her second boy, Ilmari, Vayrynen opted for the cash grant instead of the box and just re-used the clothes worn by her first, Aarni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boy can pass on clothes to a girl too, and vice versa, because the colours are deliberately gender-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contents of the box have changed a good deal over the years, reflecting changing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 30s and 40s, it contained fabric because mothers were accustomed to making the baby's clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;pullout&quot; readability=&quot;5.9880952380952&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullout-inner&quot; readability=&quot;16.582417582418&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you put your baby or toddler outside in the freezing cold for their lunchtime nap? Most Nordic parents wouldn't give it a second thought. For them it's part of their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it's good for them to be in the fresh air as soon as possible,&quot; says Lisa Mardon, a mother-of-three from Stockholm, who works for a food distribution company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Especially in the winter when there's lots of diseases going around... the kids seem healthier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21537988&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;The babies who nap in sub-zero temperatures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But during World War II, flannel and plain-weave cotton were needed by the Defence Ministry, so some of the material was replaced by paper bed sheets and swaddling cloth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50s saw an increase in the number of ready-made clothes, and in the 60s and 70s these began to be made from new stretchy fabrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1968 a sleeping bag appeared, and the following year disposable nappies featured for the first time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not for long. At the turn of the century, the cloth nappies were back in and the disposable variety were out, having fallen out of favour on environmental grounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging good parenting has been part of the maternity box policy all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Babies used to sleep in the same bed as their parents and it was recommended that they stop,&quot; says Panu Pulma, professor in Finnish and Nordic History at the University of Helsinki. &quot;Including the box as a bed meant people started to let their babies sleep separately from them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, baby bottles and dummies were removed to promote breastfeeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the main goals of the whole system was to get women to breastfeed more,&quot; Pulma says. And, he adds, &quot;It's happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also thinks including a picture book has had a positive effect, encouraging children to handle books, and, one day, to read.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in addition to all this, Pulma says, the box is a symbol. A symbol of the idea of equality, and of the importance of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;The story of the maternity pack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<og:title>Why Finnish babies sleep in boxes</og:title>
<og:type>article</og:type>
<og:description>For 75 years, Finland's expectant mothers have been given a box of baby clothes and bedding by the state. Some say it helped Finland achieve one of the world's lowest infant mortality rates.</og:description>
