&lt;td readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;I'm a 24 y/o full stack engineer (I know some of you are rolling your eyes right now, just highlighting that I have experience on frontend apps as well as backend architecture). I've been working professionally for ~7 years building mostly javascript projects but also some PHP. Two years ago I was diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher's Syndrome&quot; - characterized by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.
&lt;p&gt;I know there are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Are there blind frontend engineers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind of engineer are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really trying to get ahead of this thing and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I'm not sure what I can do if I can't do SE as I don't have any formal education in anything. I've worked really hard to get to where I am and don't want it to go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any input, and stay safe out there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your links, suggestions, and moral support, I really appreciate it. Since my diagnosis I've slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it's too late. I know I shouldn't think this way but it is hard not to. I'm very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more members of the blind engineering community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;

<title>OpenCore: Hackintosh Alternative to Clover</title>
<link>https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/README.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/README.md</guid>
<description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supported version: 0.5.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenCore is an open-source, unconventional, first-in-class piece of software designed to intercept kernel loading to insert a highly advanced rootkit, designed to be an alternative to Clover. OpenCore aims to resolve the constraints and issues imposed by Clover by providing a more versatile and modular system which can better understand symbols and structures to make patching far more precise and effective. And with it's custom prelinker, kext injection becomes macOS version agnostic meaning day 1 support on any macOS version supporting a prelinked kernel. While OpenCore is primarily designed for Hackintosh systems, it can be used in any scenario where an emulated EFI is needed with many using it on KVMs and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/opencore-on-the-mac-pro.2207814/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;real Macs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that OpenCore is still new and currently in beta. While quite stable, and arguably much more stable than Clover in pretty much every way, is still being frequently updated and so chunks of configuration change quite often(ie. New quirks replacing old ones)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, this guide is only meant to be a starting point in your journey with OpenCore and not recommended for beginners unless absolutely necessary. For those starting, please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;r/Hackintosh Vanilla Desktop Guide&lt;/a&gt;. And those who have issues can visit both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;r/Hackintosh subreddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/u8V7N5C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;r/Hackintosh discord&lt;/a&gt; for more help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This guide supports 0.5.7&lt;/strong&gt;, newer versions will require you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Differences/Differences.pdf&quot;&gt;Differences.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. Guide will be updated soon after each &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases&quot;&gt;OpenCore release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advantages of OpenCore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, OpenCore systems boot faster than those using Clover as less unnecessary patching is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better overall stability as patches can be much more precise : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/fo9bfv/macos_10154_update/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;macOS 10.15.4 update&lt;/a&gt; as an example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCore offers better overall security with better support for FileVault, no need to disable System Integrity Protection(SIP) and even secure boot-like functionality support via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/post-install/security.md#Vault&quot;&gt;Vaulting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCore supports boot hotkey support via &lt;code&gt;boot.efi&lt;/code&gt; - hold &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; at startup to choose a boot device, &lt;code&gt;Cmd+R&lt;/code&gt; to enter Recovery or &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Opt+P+R&lt;/code&gt; to reset NVRAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCore is designed with the future in mind and uses modern methods to load 3rd party kernel extensions without breaking System Integrity Protection which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/blob/ea3058f86787149a5b159872cda362c1cbb1fc6c/rEFIt_UEFI/Platform/kext_inject.cpp#L990-L1015&quot;&gt;Clover uses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BootCamp switching and boot device selection are supported by reading NVRAM variables set by Startup Disk just like a real mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future development for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acidanthera/AptioFixPkg&quot;&gt;AptioMemoryFix&lt;/a&gt; is directly tied to OpenCore, specifically being absorbed into OpenCore itself with the OpenRuntime.efi being used as an extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UEFI and Legacy boot modes are supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More sophisticated patching such as mask patching means macOS updates have very little chance of breaking AMD systems, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla/tree/opencore&quot;&gt;AMD OSX patches&lt;/a&gt; supporting all versions of High Sierra, Mojave and Catalina. &lt;strong&gt;All future AMD OSX development is tied to Opencore&lt;/strong&gt;, so for 10.15.2+ you'll need OpenCore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OpenCore Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kernel extensions are loaded in the order specified in your config file, so you must load an extension's dependencies before you load the extension itself. For example, Lilu must be loaded before WhateverGreen or VirtualSMC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMBIOS data, ACPI patches and DSDT/SSDTs are applied to all operating systems. Adjust your SSDTs with &lt;code&gt;If (_OSI (&quot;Darwin&quot;)) {}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that all SSDTs mentioned in this guide have been updated accordingly and should not affect booting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some systems require pure UEFI mode to boot. (This setting is commonly called &quot;Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode&quot; by motherboard manufacturers. See also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.Radeon.en.md&quot;&gt;flashing a UEFI ROM onto older GPUs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues can occur if NVMe devices are set up as SATA devices in the BIOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCore requires a version of macOS that supports a prelinked kernel, this means any installs of OS X 10.7 Lion or newer are supported with some later versions of OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard also having support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those having issues converting can refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/tree/master/clover-conversion&quot;&gt;Clover Conversion&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recommended BIOS settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VT-d (can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbolt(For intial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel SGX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel Platform Trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this can't be turned off in the BIOS(or even found) please consider patching it out. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extras/msr-lock.md&quot;&gt;Fixing CFG Lock&lt;/a&gt; for more info.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AMD CPU users don't need to worry about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VT-X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above 4G decoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyper-Threading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute Disable Bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EHCI/XHCI Hand-off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Forecasting s-curves is hard</title>
<link>https://constancecrozier.com/2020/04/16/forecasting-s-curves-is-hard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://constancecrozier.com/2020/04/16/forecasting-s-curves-is-hard/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;S-curves (or sigmoid functions) are commonly used to model the evolution of social or biological systems over time [1]. These functions start with exponential growth, then increase linearly, and finally level off (therefore end up looking like a wonky s). Many things that we think of as exponential functions will actually follow an s-curve (otherwise the system would reach infinity). One famous example is the adoption of a new technology. The graph below shows the percentage of US adults who own a smartphone over time, with a best-fit s-curve imposed on the top. In this case the exponential growth occurs because of the way publicity and supply are rolled out. However, there are only a limited number of potential consumers (some of whom will never get a smartphone) and so the growth gradually slows to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;74&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://constancecrozier.com/smart_phones/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1681,933&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;smart_phones&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=1000&quot; src=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-74&quot; srcset=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=300 300w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=600 600w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/smart_phones.png?w=150 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;US smartphone ownership [2]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, and the reason that these curves have been back in the news, is the propagation of disease. In this case the exponential growth occurs when the virus is new, such that most people encountering it will not have developed immunity. The level-off occurs because the virus is no longer encountering people without immunity (either due to âherd immunityâ or isolation of those infected). The graph below shows the number of deaths in China from the SARS outbreak in 2003, again with a best-fit s-curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;76&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://constancecrozier.com/sars-1/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1683,940&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;sars-1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=1000&quot; src=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-76&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; srcset=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=300 300w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=600 600w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sars-1.png?w=150 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;Deaths due to SARS in China [3]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S-curves have only three parameters, and so it is perhaps impressive that they fit a variety of systems so well. Broadly, the three parameters describe the initial growth rate, the level-off rate, and the value at which it levels-off. Therefore, if you can estimate these three numbers, then you have the trend curve. Many of us will have learnt in school that if there are three parameters to be found, you need three data points to define the function. This would suggest that you could perfectly predict the level-off point based on only three observations (spoiler: you canât).Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, while we can say that the overall trend of the data is likely to fit to some s-curve, the individual points will not all lie along it. This can be seen in both of the previous examples. This discrepancy is often described as âmodelling errorâ, which comprises both errors in the measurement of the data, and the fact that the s-curve model is fundamentally wrong. To quote George Box âall models are wrong, but some are usefulâ.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, it makes sense that it should not be possible to forecast the curve from the early data; to assume this, means believing that we canât affect the outcome. However, in my experience âintuitionâ and âmathematicsâ can often be hard to reconcile. Therefore, I decided to investigate how much the âbest fit s-curveâ changes as more data becomes available. Below is a s-curve that I chose at random. The points shown are ânoisy observationsâ â which is the maths-y way of saying âpoints from the curve with a random amount of error appliedâ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;77&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://constancecrozier.com/witgh_data/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1710,1110&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;witgh_data&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=1000&quot; src=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-77&quot; srcset=&quot;https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=300 300w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=600 600w, https://constancecrozier.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/witgh_data.png?w=150 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the s-curve model is a perfect fit â I have literally generated the data from an s-curve. This means that if there was zero error then we would only need three points to find the curve. All this to say, that this example is idealistic â in reality there is unlikely to be a curve that fits the data so well. Below is an animation showing the best fit s-curve (found using a least squares optimisation) as more data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-vimeo&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;mymovie&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/408599958?dnt=1&amp;amp;app_id=122963&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be surprising that in the exponential growth phase the estimate is very bad, but even in the linear phase (when 40+ points are available) the correct curve has not been found. In fact, it is only once the data starts to level-off that the correct s-curve is found. This is especially unhelpful when you consider that it can be quite hard to tell which part of the curve you on; hindsight is 20-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that it is impossible to model or predict s-curves. Only that, contextual information about the system you are modelling is likely required. For biological systems, are there physical parameters which govern the initial growth rate? For technological changes, can the final level-off be reasonably estimated? This information is application specific. In other words, data enthusiasts (such as myself) should leave the modelling up to the professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Apple Contact Tracing (GACT): a wolf in sheepâs clothes?</title>
<link>https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/19/google-apple-contact-tracing-gact-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/19/google-apple-contact-tracing-gact-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a critical piece about the Google Apple Contact Tracing (GACT) platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/11/stop-the-apple-and-google-contact-tracing-platform-or-be-ready-to-ditch-your-smartphone/&quot;&gt;a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in quite some discussion, which brought some more arguments to the fore, that I would like to address and clarify here. Here I focus on my area of expertise: privacy. My colleague Tamar Sharon wrote an eloquent article about the (much) &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@TamarSharon/when-google-and-apple-get-privacy-right-is-there-still-something-wrong-a7be4166c295&quot;&gt;broader picture&lt;/a&gt;, that we should definitely not lose sight of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-1861&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few people actually like the GACT platform. According to them, the platform &lt;em&gt;protects&lt;/em&gt; privacy, because it uses a decentralised form of contact tracing (where no central server learns who were in close contact). Moreover, if Apple and Google only offer access to the Bluetooth hardware (necessary to do contact tracing in the first place) through this interface, this would prevent apps form doing contact tracing in a centralised way (where the central server &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; learn which people were in close contact). In this view, the move by Google and Apple saves the whole world from a centralised contact tracing disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I beg to differ, however, for the following reasons (expanding on my previous blog post and clarifying some of my arguments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, letâs describe in a little more detail how GACT is supposed to work. Notice that some of this is a good faith effort: the published specifications (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;) are sparse and still in flux. For example, the version I saw earlier mentioned that apps could see the location where a contact took place. This is no longer the case in the current versions of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detecting nearby phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phones detect proximity of other phones by broadcasting random looking proximity identifiers over Bluetooth while listening for such random looking identifiers of phones nearby. A phone stores all proximity identifiers it receives in a local database, together with an estimate of the distance between the two phones (based on the signal strength). Identifiers received more than 14 days ago are deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These random looking proximity identifiers are generated as follows. Each phone (or other device) generates a random tracing key once. From this tracing key a daily tracing key is derived each day. And from this daily tracing key the proximity identifiers are generated, generating a new identifier whenever the MAC address of the Bluetooth interface changes, which is every 10 to 20 minutes. A hash function is used to derive the daily tracing key and the proximity. This ensures that given two different proximity identifiers you cannot determine whether they belong to the same device. In particular, you cannot recreate the daily key used to generate them. (This preserves privacy against eavesdroppers.) However, if you know the daily tracing key of a device, you can generate all proximity identifiers the device broadcast that day. This allows the contact tracing to work, even though the proximity identifiers look random and cannot normally be linked to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GACT-keys.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1862&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This generating, broadcasting and collecting proximity identifiers happens as soon as users install an Android or iOS update containing the new standard, presumable after giving explicit consent to this (and assuming users have enabled Bluetooth to begin with). &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/apple-google-coronavirus-tracing/&quot;&gt;It is important to note here that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; limited to users that actually have a Covid-19 tracing app installed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notifying contacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can only notify or be notified if a Covid-19 tracing app is installed on the device. This app uses the API provided by the GACT platform that offers (controlled) access to the set of daily keys used by a phone, and the database of proximity identifiers it collected from other nearby phones over the last 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple themselves only standardise the API and the scanning phase described above. They (apparently) do not provide a service that coordinates the notification of contacts. This has consequence for how the API works, and hence what the contact tracing app sees and what the servers used by the contact tracing app see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a user tests positive, the daily keys his or her devices used the last 14 days can be retrieved by the app through the GACT API, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/apple-and-google-answer-our-questions-239830&quot;&gt;presumably only after an authorised request from the health authorities&lt;/a&gt;. How this exactly works, and in particular how a health authority gets authorised to sign such request or generate a valid confirmation code is not clear (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption is that these keys are submitted to a central server set up by the contact tracing app. Other instances of the same app on other peopleâs phones are supposed to regularly poll this central server to see if new daily keys of phones of recently infected people have been uploaded. Another function in the GACT API allows the app to submit these daily keys to the operating system for analysis. The OS then uses these keys to derive all possible proximity identifiers from them, and compares each of these with the proximity identifiers it has stored in the database of identifiers recently received over Bluetooth. Whenever a match is found, the app is informed, and given the duration and time of contact (where the time may be rounded to daily intervals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GACT-API-1024x505.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1863&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GACT-API-1024x505.gif 1024w, https://blog.xot.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GACT-API-300x148.gif 300w, https://blog.xot.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GACT-API-768x379.gif 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact tracing moves from the app layer down to the OS layer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple announced they intend to release the APIâs in May and build this functionality into the underlying platforms in the months to follow. This means that at some point in time operating system updates (through Google Play Services updates in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21220033/android-covid-19-tracking-updates-google-play-contact-tracing&quot;&gt;the case of Android&lt;/a&gt;) will contain the new contact tracing code, ensuring that all users of a modern iPhone or Android smartphone will be tracked as soon as they accept the OS update. (Again, to be clear: this happens already even if you decide not to install a contact tracing app!) It is unclear yet how consent is handled, whether there will be OS settings allowing one to switch on or off contact tracing, what the default will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is unclear whether switching off Bluetooth will actually affect the contact tracing capability (i.e whether switching off Bluetooth will switch of all Bluetooth services except the Bluetooth hardware and the contact tracing functionality. (This is one of the reasons why a physical on-off switch for both WiFi and Bluetooth, that is known to switch off these networks at the hardware level, is desirable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/11/stop-the-apple-and-google-contact-tracing-platform-or-be-ready-to-ditch-your-smartphone/&quot;&gt;wrote earlier&lt;/a&gt; this change has serious ramifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of an app, the technology is pushed down the stack into the operating system layer creating a Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform. This means the technology is available all the time, for all kinds of applications. Contact tracing is therefore no longer limited in time, or limited in use purely to trace and contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This means that two very important safeguards to protect our privacy are thrown out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving contact tracing down the stack fundamentally changes the amount of control users have: you can uninstall a (contact tracing) app, you cannot uninstall the entire OS (although on Android you can in theory disable and even delete Google Play Services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This (technically) creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bigger picture is this: it creates a platform for contact tracing that works &lt;em&gt;all across the globe&lt;/em&gt; for most modern smart phones (Android Marshmallow and up, and iOS 13 capable devices) across &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; OS platforms. Unless appropriate safeguards are in place (including, but not limited to, the design of the system as described above â we will discuss this more below) this would create a global mass-surveillance system that would &lt;em&gt;reliably&lt;/em&gt; track who has been in contact with whom, at what time and for how long. (And where, if GPS is used to record the location.) GACT works much more reliably and extensively than any other system based on either GPS or mobile phone location data (based on cell towers) would be able to (under normal conditions). I want to stress this point because some people have responded to this threat saying that this is something companies like Google (using their GPS and WiFi names based location history tool) can already do for years. This is not the case. This type of contact tracing really brings it to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the data collection related to contact tracing starts as soon as you accept the operating system update, real contact tracing only starts to happen when people install a contact tracing app that uses the API to find contacts based on the data phones have already collected. But this assumes that both Apple and Google indeed refrain from offering other apps access to the contact tracing platform (through the API) through force or economic incentives, or suddenly decide to use the platform themselves. GACT creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance, that can be turned on with the flip of a virtual switch at Apple or Google HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GACT is leveraged because contact tracing apps are required to use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Googleâs move is significant for another reason: especially on Apple iOS devices, access to the hardware is severely restricted. This is also the case for access to Bluetooth. In fact, without approval from Apple, you cannot use Bluetooth âin the backgroundâ for your app (functionality you need to collect information about nearby phones even if the user phone is locked). Some people have interpreted GACT as a way for Apple to say: if you want to build a contact tracing app, you need us to give you special access to Bluetooth. We are not going to give you that. Instead, we allow you to use the GACT API. If this is the case, it would prevent downright centralised implementations of contact tracing (like the ones favoured by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/17/a-critical-look-at-the-eu-approach-to-contact-tracing-apps/&quot;&gt;European Commission apparently&lt;/a&gt;). Seen from this light, the GACT platform strengthens privacy. (If we trust Apple and Google).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This means the contact tracing microdata is under Apple/Google control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen from another angle however, it creates an enormous leverage for the GACT platform, as it essentially becomes the only way to do contact tracing using smartphones in the first place. With this move, Apple and Google make themselves indispensable, ensuring that this potentially global surveillance technology is forced upon us. And as a consequence &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; microdata underlying &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; contact tracing system is stored on the phones &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: some people &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1250853946077392900&quot;&gt;have claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would offer other distributed contact tracing solutions (and in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DP-3T/documents&quot;&gt;DP-3T&lt;/a&gt;) access to Bluetooth. This has not been confirmed however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all this means we all have to put a massive trust in Apple and Google to properly monitor the use of the GACT API by others, as well as trusting that they will not abuse GACT themselves. They do not necessarily have an impeccable track record that warrants such trustâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distributed can be made centralised&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion in the preceding paragraphs implicitly assumes that the GACT platform truly enforces a decentralised form of contact tracing, and that it prevents contact tracing apps from automatically collecting information on a central server about who was in contact with who. This assumption is not necessarily valid however (although it can be enforced provided Apple and Google are very strict in the vetting process used to grant apps access to the GACT platform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, GACT can easily be used to create a centralised from of contact tracing, at least when we limit our discussion to centrally storing information about who has been in contact with an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is as follows. GACT allows a contact tracing app on a phone to test daily tracing keys of infected users (which the app has to download from a central server) against the proximity identifiers collected by the phone over the last few days. This test is local; this is why GACT is considered decentralised. However, the app could immediately report back the result of this test to the central server, without user intervention (or without the user even noticing). It could even send a user specific identifier along with the result, this allowing the authorities to immediately contact anybody who has recently been in the proximity of an infected person. This is the hallmark of a centralised solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: the GACT technology itself does not prevent a centralised solution. The only thing preventing it would be Apple and Google being strict in vetting contact tracing apps. They could already do so now, without rolling out their GACT platform. Which begs the question what the real purpose of this platform isâ¦.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malicious apps can learn which people an infected person has been in contact with&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centralisation mechanism outlines above does not reveal which infected person this particular user has been in contact with. So far however, the GACT API does not seem to put a minimum on the number of keys that the app can test. This means that if the app tests all daily tracing keys one by one, it could keep track of each daily tracing key for which the test was positive, and report these back to the server. As the server knows which daily tracing key belongs to which infected person, this allows the server to know exactly with which infected persons the user of this phone has been in contact with. Whatâs worse, the current version of the API allows the app to retrieve the duration of the contact in 5 minute increments, and even when the contact occurred (although that timestamp &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have reduced precision such as within one day of the actual time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the GACT API &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; put additional restrictions in place (test at a least a minimum number of keys at the same time, and restrict the number of times keys can be tested), the API could still be abused to obtain some additional information that allows the server to link people, for example by performing timing correlation attacks, or testing sets of keys that are constructed in such a way that they belong to people known to be from different geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malicious app can also track non-infected persons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GACT API is supposed to release the daily tracing keys of an infected user only after receiving a one-time confirmation code from the health authorities)[https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/apple-and-google-answer-our-questions-239830]. How this should work is not described yet, however. Regardless, abuse is certainly conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the (health) authorities themselves are malicious (which is not an entirely unreasonable assumption in certain countries), then such a confirmation code is useless. In other words, a malicious app could act as if the user is infected (in a way that is unnoticeable to the user) and extract the daily tracing keys and upload them to the server surreptitiously. Together with the trick outlined above, this essentially allows the providers of such a malicious app to map the full social graph (i.e. who has been in contact with who, when, where and for how long).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple can decide to do the same at any time. Again we have to trust them not to do so, or not to be forced to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Function creep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of contact tracing functionality as offered through GACT is not limited to controlling just the spread of the COVID-19 virus. As this is not the first corona type virus, it is only a matter of time until a new dangerous virus will roar its ugly head. In other words, contact tracing is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, the risk of &lt;em&gt;function creep&lt;/em&gt; appears: with the technology rolled out and ready to be (re)activated, other uses of contact tracing will at some point in time be considered, and deemed proportionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tracking technology could be embedded within software libraries used in innocent looking apps (or apps that you are more or less required to have installed). Ordinary smartphones containing the GACT technology could be bought by governments and other organisations to be installed at fixed locations of interest for monitoring purposes. China could consider it to further monitor Uyghurs. Israel could use it to further monitor Palestinians. You could monitor the visitors of abortion clinics, coffee shops, gay bars, â¦.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing also has tremendous commercial value. Facebook used a crude version of contact tracing (using the access it had to WhatsApp address books) to recommend friends on Facebook. The kind of contact tracing offered by GACT (and other Bluetooth based systems) gives a much more detailed, real time, insight in peopleâs social graph and its dynamics. How much more precise could targeted adverting become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the attacks on DP-3T &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/399&quot;&gt;described by Serge Vaudenay&lt;/a&gt; also apply to GACT, like generating false possible infection alerts, and privacy risks related to the fact that the derivation of proximity identifiers from daily tracing keys is public. This allows an adversary to collect proximity identifiers and later correlate them to daily tracing keys of infected people released by the server. In other words, even decentralised contact tracing has privacy risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form a purely technological perspective, decentralised contact tracing is preferred over centralised solutions because it better protects our privacy. Unfortunately embedding it in the operating system, as proposed by Google and Apple, does not make centralised solutions impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires strong oversight by Apple and Google over the apps that want to use the GACT platform for contact tracing. Which makes the whole GACT platform a smokescreen really, as exactly the strong oversight would be required if the GACT platform was not there, and apps requested special access to Bluetooth to implement their own contact tracing technology. It is one thing to agree on a few best practices for contact tracing and force app providers to adhere to those standards. It is quite another to bake that standard into the operating system layer, active in the background, ready to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to trust Apple and Google to diligently perform this strict vetting of apps, to resist any coercion by governments, and to withstand the temptation of commercial exploitation of the data under their control. Remember: the data is collected by the operating system, whether we have an app installed or not. This is an awful amount of trustâ¦.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Covid-19âs impact on Tor</title>
<link>https://blog.torproject.org/covid19-impact-tor</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.torproject.org/covid19-impact-tor</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tor, like much of the world, has been caught up in the COVID-19 crisis. Like many other nonprofits and small businesses, the crisis has hit us hard, and we have had to make some difficult decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had to let go of 13 great people who helped make Tor available to millions of people around the world. We will move forward with a core team of 22 people, and remain dedicated to continuing our work on Tor Browser and the Tor software ecosystem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world wonât be the same after this crisis, and the need for privacy and secure access to information will become more urgent. In these times, being online is critical and many people face ongoing obstacles to getting and sharing needed information. We are taking todayâs difficult steps to ensure the Tor Project continues to exist and our technology stays available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are terribly sad to lose such valuable teammates, and we want to let all our users and supporters know that Tor will continue to provide privacy, security, and censorship circumvention services to anyone who needs them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When did I run that command? Update your Bash prompt with the command start time</title>
<link>https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/bash-prompt-with-updating-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/bash-prompt-with-updating-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I often ask âWhat time did I run that command?â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I couldnât find out quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems easy to do with other shells, but I couldnât find a way to do it with Bash, so I cooked one up. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/bash-prompt-with-updating-time/images/updating-bash-prompt-demo.gif&quot; class=&quot;center db&quot; alt=&quot;An terminal with a prompt whose timestamp updates when a command runs.&quot; width=&quot;&quot;/&gt; The updating Bash prompt in action.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-this-an-improvement&quot;&gt;How is this an improvement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time people have included the time in the Bash prompt &lt;strong&gt;at the time the prompt is written&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that a prompt can sit for any length of time before being used to run a command; the time in the prompt and command start time are uncoupled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/bash-prompt-with-updating-time/images/established-bash-prompt-problem.png&quot; class=&quot;center db&quot; alt=&quot;A terminal with prompts showing times which don't change.&quot; width=&quot;&quot;/&gt; The problem with the established approach.
&lt;p&gt;The example shows me working in the terminal at 20:45, going to to do something else for five minutes, then coming back to the terminal at 20:50. The prompt for the command I ran when I came back at 20:50 continues to show 20:45 though, and itâs only the prompt printed after that final command which shows the time as 20:50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I can get into the habit of looking at the prompt which appears after a command to show me when it ran, but thatâs clunky and unintuitive. Also, that workaround breaks for long-running commands, because the next prompt shows the time the command finished, which might be a long time after it was executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution modifies the prompt to show the time when the command is executed, not the time the prompt was written, removing that confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-do-this-too&quot;&gt;How can I do this too?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make a backup of your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file because weâre about to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, delete or comment out the existing definitions of &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt; (some of which may not be present) and put this snippet in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;DIRECTORY=&quot;\w&quot;

move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1() {
    command_rows=$(history 1 | wc -l)
    if [ &quot;$command_rows&quot; -gt 1 ]; then
        let vertical_movement=$command_rows+1
    else
        command=$(history 1 | sed 's/^\s*[0-9]*\s*//')
        command_length=${#command}
        ps1_prompt_length=${#PS1_PROMPT}
        let total_length=$command_length+$ps1_prompt_length
        let lines=$total_length/${COLUMNS}+1
        let vertical_movement=$lines+1
    fi
    tput cuu $vertical_movement
}

PS0_ELEMENTS=(
    &quot;$SAVE_CURSOR_POSITION&quot; &quot;\$(move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1)&quot;
    &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$TIMESTAMP&quot; &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$RESTORE_CURSOR_POSITION&quot;
)
PS0=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS0_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)

PS1_ELEMENTS=(
    # Empty line after last command.
    &quot;$NEWLINE&quot;
    # First line of prompt.
    &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot;

    &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot; &quot;$PS1_PROMPT&quot;
    &quot;$SINGLE_SPACE&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot;
)
PS1=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS1_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)

PS2_ELEMENTS=(

)
PS2=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS2_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)

shopt -s histverify
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now open a new shell and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the digits &lt;code&gt;33&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;PROMPT_COLOUR&lt;/code&gt; variable for a different prompt colour. See the &lt;strong&gt;FG Code&lt;/strong&gt; column in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;light-red link&quot;&gt;this colour table in Wikpedia's ANSI escape code article&lt;/a&gt; for colour codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-overview&quot;&gt;The overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt is printed in the terminal and it waits for a command. Once a command is typed and &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; is pressed, &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt; is expanded. This runs the &lt;code&gt;move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1&lt;/code&gt; function. This function moves the cursor to the beginning of the first line of the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt, overwrites the string &lt;code&gt;--:--&lt;/code&gt; with the current time, then returns the cursor to its earlier position. Then the command executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now letâs look at each portion of the code in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-constants&quot;&gt;The constants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;DIRECTORY=&quot;\w&quot;
DOUBLE_SPACE=&quot;  &quot;
NEWLINE=&quot;\n&quot;
NO_COLOUR=&quot;\e[00m&quot;
PRINTING_OFF=&quot;\[&quot;
PRINTING_ON=&quot;\]&quot;
PROMPT_COLOUR=&quot;\e[0;33m&quot;
PS1_PROMPT=&quot;\$&quot;
PS2_PROMPT=&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;
RESTORE_CURSOR_POSITION=&quot;\e[u&quot;
SAVE_CURSOR_POSITION=&quot;\e[s&quot;
SINGLE_SPACE=&quot; &quot;
TIMESTAMP=&quot;\A&quot;
TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER=&quot;--:--&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, these constants donât need to be created, but I find that they make building, reading and debugging &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt; much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters which start with a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; are interpreted in the prompt as explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;light-red link&quot;&gt;Bash Reference Manual section on controlling the prompt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constant values which donât start with a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; are strings which will be printed in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SAVE_CURSOR_POSITION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RESTORE_CURSOR_POSITION&lt;/code&gt; values are escape codes which save and restore the cursor position but arenât printed in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PROMPT_COLOUR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NO_COLOUR&lt;/code&gt; values are escape codes which set and unset a colour but arenât printed in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cursor-repositioning-function&quot;&gt;The cursor repositioning function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1() {
    command_rows=$(history 1 | wc -l)
    if [ &quot;$command_rows&quot; -gt 1 ]; then
        let vertical_movement=$command_rows+1
    else
        command=$(history 1 | sed 's/^\s*[0-9]*\s*//')
        command_length=${#command}
        ps1_prompt_length=${#PS1_PROMPT}
        let total_length=$command_length+$ps1_prompt_length
        let lines=$total_length/${COLUMNS}+1
        let vertical_movement=$lines+1
    fi
    tput cuu $vertical_movement
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how many lines the command spans and where the cursor ends up as a result, the cursor has to be repositioned to the beginning of the prompt to overwrite the &lt;code&gt;--:--&lt;/code&gt; placeholder with the time the command was run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function works out how many lines are in the command, and repositions the cursor accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are examples of commands of varying lengths which must be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/bash-prompt-with-updating-time/images/updating-bash-prompt-examples.png&quot; class=&quot;center db&quot; alt=&quot;A terminal showing several commands of different lengths.&quot; width=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Commands with different lengths and line counts must be handled.
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;command_rows&lt;/code&gt; variable gets the number of lines the command is split over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If itâs a multi-line command, we take the first path through the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement. In this case, the number of lines below the top line of the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt that the cursor will be is the number of lines in the command plus one, so thatâs what weâll set &lt;code&gt;vertical_movement&lt;/code&gt; to. The &lt;code&gt;tput&lt;/code&gt; command moves the cursor up by that number of lines and places it at the start of the top line of the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If itâs a single-line command, we take the second path through the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement. We get the length of the command and add add it to the length of the second line of the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt, then divide that by the number of columns in the terminal window (the &lt;code&gt;COLUMNS&lt;/code&gt; variable) to get the number of lines the command takes up. This allows for long commands which wrap over multiple lines. Then we use the &lt;code&gt;tput&lt;/code&gt; command to place the cursor at the start of the top line of the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ps-variables&quot;&gt;The PS variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PS0_ELEMENTS=(
    &quot;$SAVE_CURSOR_POSITION&quot; &quot;\$(move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1)&quot;
    &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$TIMESTAMP&quot; &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$RESTORE_CURSOR_POSITION&quot;
)
PS0=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS0_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)

PS1_ELEMENTS=(
    # Empty line after last command.
    &quot;$NEWLINE&quot;
    # First line of prompt.
    &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot;
    &quot;$TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER&quot; &quot;$DOUBLE_SPACE&quot; &quot;$DIRECTORY&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot;
    &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot; &quot;$NEWLINE&quot;
    # Second line of prompt.
    &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot; &quot;$PS1_PROMPT&quot;
    &quot;$SINGLE_SPACE&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot;
)
PS1=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS1_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)

PS2_ELEMENTS=(
    &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$PROMPT_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot; &quot;$PS2_PROMPT&quot;
    &quot;$SINGLE_SPACE&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_OFF&quot; &quot;$NO_COLOUR&quot; &quot;$PRINTING_ON&quot;
)
PS2=$(IFS=; echo &quot;${PS2_ELEMENTS[*]}&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of declaring all those constants earlier was to make the prompt declarations more semantic, and not just the usual one-liner soup of backslashes and square brackets. I think it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt;, we make a list of their elements, then join the elements together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, hereâs the same code written in the more traditional fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PS0=&quot;\e[s\$(move_cursor_to_start_of_ps1)\e[0;33m\A\e[00m\e[u&quot;
PS1=&quot;\n\[\e[0;33m\]--:--  \w\[\e[00m\]\n\[\e[0;33m\]$ \[\e[00m\]&quot;
PS2=&quot;\[\e[0;33m\]&amp;gt; \[\e[00m\]&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is far more terse, but itâs also much more difficult to read, modify and debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But letâs move away from style and back to functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youâre probably already familiar with the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; prompt. All Iâll say about this particular &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; is that we have to switch the prompt colour on then off for each of the two lines, otherwise the colourisation of the second line with the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; prompt doesnât work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt; variable is comparatively recent, apparently having been introduced to Bash in 2016. It is expanded after the &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; key is pressed and before the command is run. You can see that this particular &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt; is saving the position of the cursor once &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; is pressed, moving the cursor to the start of the prompt, writing the current time there which overwrites the &lt;code&gt;--:--&lt;/code&gt; placeholder, then returning the cursor to the saved position ready for the command to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youâll notice that the &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt; variable is also declared. Once youâve coloured &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt;, you might as well colour &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt; to match it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shopt-command&quot;&gt;The shopt command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;shopt -s histverify
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, this covers a corner case by showing the result of a history substitution command in a subsequent prompt for verification rather than executing it immediately. Without it, history substitution commands like &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!274&lt;/code&gt; cause the time to be written one line too low when the command is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonât spend time explaining why. If youâre interested, comment it out and see how your prompt behaves when you give it &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;. It has to do with the position of the cursor when &lt;code&gt;PS0&lt;/code&gt; is expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-less-niggle&quot;&gt;One less niggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line is simple and satisfying, and if you spend hours in it every day itâs also full of little niggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tweak removes one of those niggles for me. If youâre also a Bash user, I hope it can do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Itâs Time to Build</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content__primary&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content__post-body wp-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but itâs not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed â no Western country, or state, or city was prepared â and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the other part of the problem is what we didnât *do* in advance, and what weâre failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our widespread inability to *build*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this today with the things we urgently need but donât have. We donât have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials â including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We donât have enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we donât have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns â as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for rain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also donât have therapies or a vaccine â despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists will hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even then, weâll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter â it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourgeâs 2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., we donât even have the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when itâs needed most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to â specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You donât just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We canât build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential â which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also canât build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBOâs âWestworldâ wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didnât film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin â they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isnât that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; weâve been doing education research thatâs never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why havenât we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know â and weâre experiencing right now! â the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why arenât we building Elon Muskâs âalien dreadnoughtsâ â giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost â all throughout our country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? Iâm with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we donât know â all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldnât have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents donât like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge â build new things and show the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective â how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why canât 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldnât regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building â energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so letâs build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we donât, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price. Whatâs the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building isnât easy, or weâd already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. Weâre all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work youâre doing isnât either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, weâve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems â we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Hereâs a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? Thereâs an excellent chance Iâll agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and thatâs to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
