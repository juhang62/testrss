&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Thomas Carell is right, around 4 billion years ago, much of Earth might have been blanketed with a greyish-brown kind of mineral. This was no ordinary rock, however: it consisted of crystals of the organic molecules that scientists now call A, U, C and G. And some of these, the theory goes, would later serve as the building blocks of RNA, the evolutionary engine of the first living organisms, before DNA existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carell, an organic chemist, and his collaborators have now demonstrated a chemical pathway that — in principle — could have made A, U, C and G (adenine, uracil, cytosine and guanine, respectively) from basic ingredients such as water and nitrogen under conditions that would have been plausible on the early Earth. The reactions produce so much of these nucleobases that, millennium after millennium, they could have accumulated in thick crusts, Carell says. His team describes the results in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; on 3 October&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02622-4#ref-CR1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add credence to the ‘RNA world’ hypothesis, says Carell, who is at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. This idea suggests that life arose from self-replicating, RNA-based genes — and that only later did organisms develop the ability to store genetic information in the molecule’s close relative, DNA. The chemistry is also a “strong indication” that the appearance of RNA-based life was not an exceedingly lucky event, but one that is likely to happen on many other planets, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous work in 2016, Carell’s team had found chemical reactions that spontaneously yielded the nucleobases A and G&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02622-4#ref-CR2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A separate group had done a similar proof-of-principle&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02622-4#ref-CR3&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the other two, U and C in 2009. But the two pathways seemed incompatible with each other, requiring different conditions, such as divergent temperatures and pH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Carell’s team has shown how all nucleobases could form under one set of conditions: two separate ponds that cycle through the seasons, going from wet to dry, from hot to cold, and from acidic to basic, and with chemicals occasionally flowing from one pond to the other. The researchers first let simple molecules react in hot water and then allowed the resulting mix to cool down and dry up, forming a residue at the bottom that contained crystals of two organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then added water back, and one of the compounds dissolved and was washed away into another reservoir. The absence of that water-soluble molecule allowed the other compound to undergo further reactions. The researchers then mixed the products again, and their reactions formed the nucleobases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This paper has demonstrated marvellously the chemistry that needs to take place so you can make all the RNA nucleosides,” says Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy, a chemist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. But he and other researchers often warn that this and similar results are based on hindsight and might not offer credible guidance as to how life actually evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next major problem Carell wants to tackle is what reactions could have formed the sugar ribose, which needs to link to nucleobases before RNA can form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Pricing niche products</title>
<link>https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinlynagh.com/&quot;&gt;← Back to Kevin's homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;published&quot;&gt;Published: 2019 August 22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a friend who runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://keycult.io/&quot;&gt;Keycult&lt;/a&gt;, a business that designs and sells $500 keyboard kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not keyboards — keyboard &lt;em&gt;kits&lt;/em&gt; — the buyer must provide their own switches and keycaps, as well as solder everything together themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/keycult-assembly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My friend's beautiful hands, assembling a high-end custom keyboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://keycult.io/pages/no-1-rev-1-build-log&quot;&gt;More photos of my friend’s beautiful hands assembling a keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew nerds built their own mechanical keyboards, but I hadn’t realized just how deep this obsessive-collector subculture went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my visit, my friend listed their kits for sale and sold out their entire inventory of 60 kits &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did what any good friend would do: Point out that $500 is obviously below the market-clearing price and they should charge more next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But exactly how much more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-primer-on-the-custom-keyboard-market&quot;&gt;A primer on the custom keyboard market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can buy fully-assembled mechanical keyboards at retail; the largest sub-market is “gaming”, where keyboards run $50–200 and look exactly like what you’d expect (black with Mountain Dew-colored LED back-lighting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my friend serves a very different niche, which I’ll call the “enthusiast market”. This market consists of folks who hang out in online forums like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/&quot;&gt;r/MechanicalKeyboards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://deskthority.net/&quot;&gt;Deskthority&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://geekhack.org/index.php&quot;&gt;GeekHack&lt;/a&gt;, where they swap keyboard photos, trade rare boards and keycap sets, and record videos about (I’m not joking here) how to install space bars backwards and lubricate switches to improve key-feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for buying custom keyboards on these communities roughly goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A creator posts 3D renders of a new keyboard design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They hype up a “group buy” to collect enough money for a production run with a Chinese contract manufacturer (the keyboards are typically CNC-machined aluminum with custom circuit boards, so unit costs work out much better when ordering 20+ parts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If enough folks pre-order, the group buy goes forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuff then goes terribly wrong (the organizer runs off with the cash, the organizer wasn’t a scammer but PayPal understandably freezes their account anyway after 100 strangers suddenly wire over $500 each, the PCBs don’t work, the aluminum anodization turns out poorly, etc., etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 6+ months and much gnashing of teeth on the forums, a keyboard kit shows up in the mail (maybe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;(That my friend has a reliable track record for delivering keyboards on time in part explains their brand’s popularity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-a-price&quot;&gt;Setting a price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to my friend’s pricing dilemma — how should they choose a price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach could be to estimate various factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;design and manufacturing costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk premium (given that my friend is financing the production and selling at retail, rather than just collecting pre-order money)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aesthetic / brand premium (I’m told Keycult keyboards are super dope — personally I can confirm that they’re pretty heavy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then combine them into a single price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m not a fan of this inside-out approach, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;factors like “brand premium” are inherently subjective — the temptation to compare to others limits potential upside and differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;picking a (new, higher) price may have reputational downsides (because &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; your customers spend all day in mechanical keyboard chat rooms and may gripe about you “selling out the community”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you will second guess yourself regardless of the outcome; either you sell out again (goto 0) or you sell too few and then must live with the shame of having $20k worth of unsold keyboard in your garage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most compelling argument against simply picking a price, though, is that it &lt;em&gt;limits how much you can learn about your market&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a sale at $X, the most you can learn is that Y people were willing to buy there. Actually, not even that: If your entire inventory sells out, you learn only that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; that many people were willing to buy — you don’t learn how many would’ve bought your kit, had it been in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vickrey-auction-as-price-discovery-mechanism&quot;&gt;Vickrey auction as price discovery mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than speculate on a price, I convinced my friend to run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction&quot;&gt;Vickrey auction&lt;/a&gt; to let their market determine the price. The auction worked as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On their next sale, my friend held out 10 kits to sell via auction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidders had 24 hours to submit a sealed bid (“sealed” meaning bidders can’t see each other’s bids)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The highest 10 bidders won, and they all paid the same price — the 11th highest bid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See &lt;a href=&quot;https://keycult.io/blogs/typings/the-vickrey-auction-and-why-were-using-it&quot;&gt;Keycult’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; for more details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the Vickrey auction from a game theoretic perspective — namely that it incentivizes bidders to ignore other bidders and simply state their own true value — but the auction has other benefits for an ongoing luxury keyboard brand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The price is set by “the community”, which deflects whining from toxic nerds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All buyers will likely all pay &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than they were willing to pay, which makes ‘em feel like they got a good deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The auction yields a full demand curve, &lt;em&gt;including the maximum price each customer is willing to pay and their freaking email address!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their next sale, my friend reserved 10 keyboards to sell via an auction. This auction worked out…well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/keyboard-auction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Vickrey auction results graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 kits sold for 3x list price, with the top bidder willing to pay 5x list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, my friend is now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://keycult.io/pages/commissions&quot;&gt;custom commissions&lt;/a&gt; (if someone wants to pay you $2,500+, find a way to let them!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visiting their factory in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen&quot;&gt;Big Rock Candy Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to organize a much larger production run (if a lot of people want to pay you $500+, let them too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-isnt-this-more-common&quot;&gt;Why isn’t this more common?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t overstate the benefits of knowing the demand curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my friend’s case, the auction let them sell far above their initial price &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; revealed that the market was deep enough to justify a larger production run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of an ongoing concern with multiple production runs, having email addresses associated with price-levels allows for very effective targeted email marketing: “Hey, we just did a larger run with lower unit-costs, so now we can afford to sell you a board for $X — you still in?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these benefits, why aren’t such auctions more common in artisan manufacturing niches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m seriously interested, so if you have ideas please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kevin@keminglabs.com&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations I don’t find compelling, buyer-side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust&lt;/strong&gt;: A pre-order (whether organized on Reddit or Kickstarter) already requires trusting that the seller will actually deliver the product; this level of trust ought to subsume the level needed to run a Vickrey auction honestly/correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyer confusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Did I mention that these people spend all day in keyboard chat rooms and regularly wait 6+ months for purchases to arrive? It’s not exactly a casual crowd. (My friend reported that, after announcing the auction, several chat room regulars excitedly re-lived their undergraduate economics heyday by extolling the game-theoretic virtues of the Vickrey mechanism.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyer preference&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps buyers simply prefer having upfront price levels? It’s familiar, and also allows them to both comparison shop and pre-allocate an overall “hip desk setup” budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps these factors will keep auctions out of the mainstream consumer consciousness, but the empirical success of the Keycult auction shows that enthusiast buyers are open to participating in non-traditional market mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations I don’t find compelling, seller-side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation complexity&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s negligible additional complexity to running a sealed-bid auction compared to a fixed-price pre-order or a Shopify/Etsy retail backend. (My friend linked to a Google form, sorted the resulting bid spreadsheet, and sent Shopify invoices to the winning bidders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bundling considerations&lt;/strong&gt;: One hipster desk accessory company I spoke with (not keyboards) bases their pricing strategy on differential product margins: Their primary product has low margins (but attracts customers) and they profit when customers purchase high-margin “add-ons”. While it’s not obvious how auctions could fit into such a strategy, bundling limitations cannot explain the behavior of niche keyboard sellers who have only a single product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially compelling explanations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early days&lt;/strong&gt;: Niche online communities organizing manufacturing runs of anything at all is a recent thing, enabled by the accessibility of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;online forums (Reddit, 14 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese contract manufacturers (Alibaba, 20 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e-commerce platforms (Shopify, 20 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is simply too young, and cultural norms just haven’t grown beyond either “I’m hooking up my friend at cost” or “I’m raising capital to sell 50,000 units at retail”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inefficiency-as-virtue&lt;/strong&gt;: Folks designing/collecting keyboards are true enthusiasts, and it’s really a status game with satisfaction derived from exclusivity. I.e., designers are proud their work sold out and collectors are validated for having spent so much time in the chat rooms by getting to the purchase link first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOMO&lt;/strong&gt; (fear of missing out) premium: By committing to a fixed price and quantity upfront, a group buy cultivates a sense of urgency which results in higher prices than would otherwise be achieved in a “more efficient” market mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none of these explanations feel like a slam dunk: The first two sound like “people are dumb amateurs who don’t like money”, whereas the third presupposes that Reddit keyboard designers have all attained galaxy-brain levels of economic reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if you have an explanation that I missed, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kevin@keminglabs.com&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-are-worried-about-custom-keyboard-market-liquidity&quot;&gt;People are worried about custom keyboard market liquidity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe not a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people worry about the liquidity of niche products on Reddit. But I do think improving those markets would, on the margin, increase the amount of interesting, small-run art / products in the world. This could occur via at least two mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a product designer who runs a Vickrey auction instead of a fixed-price, fixed-quantity pre-order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism 1: Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt; The designer can use the demand curve to &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; the size of their production run — maximizing either their profit (as a business) or their status (as an enthusiast, maximizing distribution of their work and spreading the “keeb lifestyle”). Either way, the more effectively they meet their goals, the more likely they’ll be inclined to produce work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism 2: Super-niche discovery&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike a fixed-price pre-order, auctions will discover the super fans who’ll pay $2,684 for a keyboard kit. These price levels may easily determine the viability of a niche or polarizing product (e.g., successfully selling at $2,000 to 10 people versus a failing a $200 pre-order with 70 backers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the trends that’ve enabled niche manufacturing in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;direct producer-consumer relationships online via email newsletters, forums, social media, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decreased production costs and turnaround time (whether via contract manufacturers or in-house, e.g., CNC capabilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems feasible that creators could run regular pre-order auctions to quantitatively gauge the viability of new design ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’d love for the preorder status quo to shift from “would you buy this?” to the more nuanced “&lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; would you pay for this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my friend discovered, the answer to the latter may be a pleasant surprise =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-reading&quot;&gt;Further reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc-thoughts&quot;&gt;Misc. thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut feeling is that, in general, purchasing power correlates inversely with time spent commenting on Reddit, so creators should spend more time developing other marketing channels. But if auctions allow creators to capture “super-fan” dollars, should they be spending &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; time engaging Reddit and community chat rooms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pursuing super-fans, at what point does a creator transition from “small niche market manufacturer” to — in the limit of a single super-fan — “commissioned artist”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard group buy FOMO reminds me of another market with hyped upcoming releases, limited availability, and obsessive collectors: Sneakerheads. However in that case, sneaker manufacturers profit (I assume) not from the limited-run sneakers directly, but from the “halo effect” that boosts sales of their mainstream product lines. As far as I can tell, no keyboard creators are pursuing this strategy — all the online stores I’ve seen tend to have a lot of (sold out) kits at the same price level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 Apr 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a long weekend, I’m standing in my flat, 10 lenses scattered across the desk in front of me. I’m wearing weird glasses consisting of an empty plastic frame and some lenses stuck into it. I squint out of the window, trying to read number plates of cars parked in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with the idea of getting my Pilot’s License for which you need to pass a medical exam which includes an eye test. Being a contact lens guy, I had a pair of glasses, the lenses of which had values that had gone out of sync with my contact lenses. I was only using it for staring at the screen in the evenings and didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This however posed a problem for passing the medical exam as an eye doctor checks your eyes and your glasses. I therefore went on a mission to get new glasses. Getting new glasses is simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-new-glasses-is-simple-right&quot;&gt;Getting new glasses is simple, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a superficial level, getting a new pair of glasses seemed simple. But once you add in my perfectionism, it exploded in complexity. I ended up going to two different opticians and an eye doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;optician-1&quot;&gt;Optician 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enter the store. A very friendly lady wearing hipster clothes greets me. The equipment seems a bit minimalistic - only a small room with a chair and some letters on the wall. Not sure if all the five-star reviews on Google Maps were fake or submitted by other hipster people who don’t care much about equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She measures the lenses of my old pair of glasses with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensmeter&quot;&gt;Lensmeter&lt;/a&gt;. Based on those values, she conducts the eye test. Unfortunately, I can’t find a pair of glasses which I like and she’s not happy to share the measurements with me as she fears I’ll run off and get my glasses made online (I’d never do that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems to forget the fact that I’m a doctor which means that I’m good at memorizing arbitrary facts and I also know some things about eyes. I catch a glimpse of her notes and remember the values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;R sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;-8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;177&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;optician-2&quot;&gt;Optician 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pondered the “I have a very specific taste and am not happy with most glasses” problem. This time, I prepared by looking at glasses online. I found a model which I liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an optician store which was a partner of the online shop, I get another eye test done. The guy is super nice and he really seems to know his stuff. The equipment seems much more sophisticated, most notable he measures my eye values with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorefractor&quot;&gt;Autorefractor&lt;/a&gt; prior to conducting the eye test. He seems more confident in the way he holds lenses in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;R sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;-8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? A difference of +0.5 in the left sphere and -0.75 in the left cylinder, also +18° in the left axis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the sphere can be explained, he said I’m probably between -6.5 and -7.0 and he prefers to use the lesser strength, makes sense. The difference in cylinder is hard to explain though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end up ordering a pair of glasses from him directly, ditching the online store. For me, it actually made sense to pay the premium as his service was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks and three meetings later (long story omitted), I have my new glasses. They’re great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure. I do see much better than with my old glasses but I still see worse than with my contact lenses. Maybe the measurement wasn’t completely accurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;eye-doctor&quot;&gt;Eye Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might remember, I was actually in the process of getting my medical certificate for the Pilot’s License. For that, I had to get an exam by a certified eye doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse measured my new pair of glasses with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensmeter&quot;&gt;Lensmeter&lt;/a&gt;, entered the value into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoropter&quot;&gt;Phoropter&lt;/a&gt; and let me stare at some letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurse: “Can you read those letters?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O: “Yeah”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurse: “Please read them out loud”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O: “Umm wait.. No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I couldn’t see all that well with my new glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to the eye doctor, I mentioned that these glasses were new and what he thinks of them as they apparently are suboptimal. He said something along the lines of “dude you’re so short-sighted, the variance in measurements is always going to be there and your optician did a good enough job”. Well, that at least confirms my positive opinion of the optician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him if he could share the measurements with me. As he wasn’t afraid of disruption through online opticians, he was happy to print them out. Note: These are the automated autorefractor results. The optician results so far were eye test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;R sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;-8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;175&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a cylinder of -1.0 in the right side (R cyl, R ax). Also, the difference in the left cylinder (L cyl) is -1.0 compared to Optician 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eye test problems can be summarized in one dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optician: “Now with this lens, do you see better or worse?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O: “Honestly, I have no clue. Maybe. Maybe not? The letters look similar but different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few seconds to decide whether I see some letters better and this decision will decide which lenses I’ll have in my glasses for the next few years? Absurd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a trustworthy decision be made in this not-real-life scenario of staring at letters on a wall? I want to be able to decide while going about my daily routine: Staring at computer screens, looking out of the window, looking into space. My daily routine doesn’t include staring at the same five letters projected onto a white wall and reading them out loud. When trying out contact lenses, that’s actually how it’s done: Your optician orders a new pair for you and you wear it for a few days. Only then you decide whether it’s an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want the same process for glasses. I am sure that I can determine whether a certain lens is an improvement (“do I see better or worse?”) if only I’m given enough time to try it out in my own settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening it dawned on me. “If only I had those lenses” I thought. Both problems could be solved - I could take my time trying them out in the comfort of my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How expensive would that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-it-myself&quot;&gt;Doing it myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed an “optician kit” consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trial lenses: A large number of lenses with varying corrections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trial frame: A pair of glasses without lenses into which you can insert the trial lenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, you can order these kits online from very trustworthy Chinese resellers for around 190€.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward two weeks later. It’s a long weekend, I’m standing in my flat, 10 lenses scattered across the desk in front of me. I’m wearing the trial frame with some lenses stuck into it. I squint out of the window, trying to read number plates of cars parked in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a doctor I know some things about the human eye so I understand how to use those lenses. However, I have no clue about the magic ritual of the optician (“Do you see better with this lens?” - selects random lens and holds it in front of my eye).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn’t have to. As I already had three results, I could try each of them out and then make minor changes through trial and error. Also, I had my pair of new glasses by now so I had a ground truth to compare the Chinese lenses to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;initial-findings&quot;&gt;Initial findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before an eye test, the optician typically tells you to not wear your contact lenses for at least 12 hours. I wondered if there is any evidence to support this, so I conducted eye tests of myself in the evenings just after taking out my contact lenses and in the mornings 12 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there is a measurable difference of around -0.5dpt in the sphere and -1.0dpt in the cylinder. So it’s pretty cool that I could experimentally prove this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;own-measurement&quot;&gt;Own measurement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a some trial and error, I arrived at a combination of lenses with which I could see very well. Looking through the trial frame with the lenses in it, my vision was better than with my new pair of glasses and even better than with my contact lenses. This was the best I’ve seen in years and quite an experience in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;R sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;R ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L sph&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L ax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;-8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;175&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the optician who made my glasses, the values for the spheres are identical but the values for the cylinders on both sides differ by -0.5 and -0.75. Interestingly, I measured the same axis on the left side which is some evidence that I’m doing things correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the eye doctor, the values for the spheres are identical again while the values for the cylinders differ by +0.5 on the left and +0.25 on the right side. The values for the axis are identical (right) and very similar (left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying out lenses by yourself, there’s always the danger of over-correcting the sphere when being short-sighted. Here, this wasn’t the case as I measured the same sphere values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I arrived at some sort of juxtaposition of prior measurements. I can’t really explain how the prior eye tests could get some values right while getting others wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far though, my measurements were solely based on the Chinese lens kit. I still couldn’t rule out an error in the lenses or even my measuring skills. What if I was making a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-my-money-where-my-mouth-is&quot;&gt;Putting my money where my mouth is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to put my measurements to the test was to order a pair of glasses with those values. Of course, I wanted to control for the frame so I’d have to order the same one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my values and a 20% discount code, it still would cost around 280€. Quite a sum for measurements based on cheap lenses and my total lack of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through with it and the pair of glasses arrived around two weeks later. Putting them on for the first time, my vision was just as perfect as with the trial lenses. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was hands-down the best pair of glasses I ever had. Better yet, it was the first pair of glasses with which I could see better than with contact lenses (as those don’t have a cylinder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts-and-cliffhanger&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts and cliffhanger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to conduct a more accurate eye test and confirmed my measurements by ordering a pair of glasses which turned out to be my best glasses ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like there’s quite some potential in optimizing your health if you dig deep and put enough time into the process. You want perfect lenses? Test your eyes repeatedly for a few hours in total. Want to optimize your medication? Read up on all relevant studies and guidelines. Want to optimize your blood sugar values? Get a continuous blood glucose monitor and keep track of everything you ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why were the other eye test results inaccurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it depends more on the time you get to spend with the new lenses before having to make a decision? Or maybe the two opticians I visited were simply not good enough. Or my eye sight actually changed in between measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the optician with the story that “an eye doctor has measured some slightly different values”. He became very interested and we did another eye test. He was blinded to the values which I had measured. Surprisingly, both the measurement with the refractometer and the eye test now yielded different results which were identical for one eye and very close for the other! So there is some evidence that my eye sight may have changed in the meantime and the optician actually did a good job. We decided to follow up on this by doing another eye test in the near future, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing. Do you remember the process in which an optician makes you wear a new pair of glasses and stares at you with this optician-look, takes the pair of glasses away from you again, goes to the back office and starts bending parts of it in a seemingly random manner, comes back, hands you the pair of glasses which now suddenly fit perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I attempted to do that with my new pair of glasses and noticed that I suck at it. I would bend it to look similar like the glasses from the optician only to realize that the back of my ears were hurting after a few hours of wear. Then I would bend them differently only to have them repeatedly slip forward on my nose warranting me to push them up every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of bending, it still fits less well than the other pair. So I guess there are some subtleties of making glasses which are not easily replaceable through an online store.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Calibre 4.0</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/thirteen</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, calibre users. It has been two years since calibre 3.0. This time has been spent mostly in making the calibre Content server ever more capable as well as migrating calibre itself from &lt;em&gt;Qt WebKit&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Qt WebEngine&lt;/em&gt;, because the former is no longer maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content server has gained the ability to &lt;em&gt;Edit metadata&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Add/remove books&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;em&gt;Convert books&lt;/em&gt; to and from all the formats calibre itself supports. It is now a full fledged interface to your calibre libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change to use &lt;em&gt;Qt WebEngine&lt;/em&gt; has entailed a complete rewrite of various parts of calibre, including the &lt;em&gt;E-book Viewer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PDF Output&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Book details&lt;/em&gt; etc. Every attempt has been made to preserve features and functionality in a backwards compatible way, see below for a list of some known incompatibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm — without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the lifetime of the 3.x series. This document describes new features as compared to 3.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what was new in previous major calibre releases: &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/twelve&quot;&gt;3.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/eleven&quot;&gt;2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/ten&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/nine&quot;&gt;0.9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/eight&quot;&gt;0.8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/seven&quot;&gt;0.7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A brief history of government efforts to stop people from wearing masks</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1721901/hong-kong-anti-mask-law-a-history-of-mask-bans-around-the-world/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1721901/hong-kong-anti-mask-law-a-history-of-mask-bans-around-the-world/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;The Hong Kong government today (Oct. 4) &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1721923/anti-mask-law-hong-kong-uses-colonial-era-emergency-powers/&quot;&gt;invoked emergency powers to enact a ban on wearing face masks&lt;/a&gt; in public, even as critics decried the move as setting a dangerous precedent and jeopardizing the city’s protection of civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;It’s not the first place in the world to impose such a ban, and other countries have similar restrictions. France imposed a ban on face coverings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/14/france-senate-muslim-veil-ban&quot;&gt;in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-veil/belgian-parliament-votes-to-ban-wearing-of-veil-idUSTRE63S4VU20100429&quot;&gt;as did Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/02/lleida-burqa-ban-spain&quot;&gt;Catalonia region&lt;/a&gt; of Spain. Italy followed suit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/03/italy-draft-law-burqa&quot;&gt;in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, France &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47070263&quot;&gt;imposed a ban on masks at public demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;, amid the months-long Yellow Vest protests. Many other countries have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=212283&quot;&gt;similar rules&lt;/a&gt;, including Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Germany, and the Netherlands. Ukraine’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-law/ukraine-parliament-pushes-through-sweeping-anti-protest-law-idUSBREA0F12M20140116&quot;&gt;anti-protest law of 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which was hurriedly enacted and included a ban on wearing masks, was meant to crack down on protesters but instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4w7x9d/ukraine-maidan-protests-yanukoyvch-ban-law&quot;&gt;sparked an angry outcry&lt;/a&gt; that quickly grew into violent clashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;The US, meanwhile, goes back much further to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/08/17/can_you_be_arrested_for_wearing_a_mask_in_nyc_.html&quot;&gt;mid-19th century&lt;/a&gt;, when an anti-mask law was enacted in New York state in an attempt to quell a violent uprising by tenant farmers. The law was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904194604576581171443151568&quot;&gt;cited by New York police&lt;/a&gt; (paywall) when they made arrests of Occupy protesters in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
A masked anti-government protester in the city’s downtown on Friday.
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Supporters of Hong Kong’s mask ban point to these countries as examples. But pro-democracy lawmaker Dennis Kwok has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JOceanW/status/1179693822789349377&quot;&gt;dismissed comparisons&lt;/a&gt; to similar face-mask bans in countries like the US and Canada, emphasizing that those are fully-fledged democracies while neither the legislative nor the executive branch in Hong Kong is accountable to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;People also &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1675353/why-ukrainians-are-closely-watching-hong-kongs-protests/&quot;&gt;cite Ukrainians’ reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the country’s strict anti-protest laws as a cautionary tale. In local online forums, Hong Kongers have been sharing a speech made by jailed activist Edward Leung, who has become something of &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1678104/jailed-activist-edward-leung-is-hong-kong-protesters-spiritual-leader/&quot;&gt;a spiritual leader of the city’s protesters&lt;/a&gt;. During his 2016 election campaign for the legislature, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/03/hong-kong-pro-beijing-figures-urge-govt-ban-face-masks-amid-ongoing-protests/&quot;&gt;cautioned against an anti-mask law&lt;/a&gt;. “A few years ago, Ukraine passed an anti-mask law. Do you know what happened in Ukraine? A revolution started in Ukraine. You want to do it? Do it, we will fight till the end,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RTR3J6ZK.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=450&amp;amp;h=306&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;A gas mask and flowers are seen at the site of the recent clashes in Kiev March 30, 2014.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Gleb Garanich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
A gas mask and flowers were left in 2014 at the protest site in Kyiv where more than 100 people were killed.
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;At its core, face mask bans pose a question about power: who gets to wield it, and who gets to place limits on it. The masked person can look but not be seen—an enormous and liberating power particularly in today’s age of surveillance. For the state and those in authority, the mask represents a threat because their power is in part drawn from knowing exactly who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;For many in Hong Kong, the face mask ban is a reminder of the asymmetrical balance of power that &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1656991/why-hong-kong-protesters-destroyed-the-citys-legislature/&quot;&gt;they are protesting so hard against&lt;/a&gt;. While citizens are now prohibited from wearing masks in public assemblies, police officers will continue to be able to conceal their identities: many have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/21/hong-kong-activists-complain-police-failed-display-id-numbers-security-chief-says-uniform-no-room/&quot;&gt;refused to wear or produce their warrant cards&lt;/a&gt;, and have put &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xinwenxiaojie/status/1150371644843712513?s=20&quot;&gt;strips of reflective tape&lt;/a&gt; on their visors to further hide their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Writing in his book &lt;em&gt;Man, Play and Games&lt;/em&gt;, the 20th-century French intellectual Roger Caillois observed the diametrical opposition between the mask and the uniform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_9f6a5&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a police state, the uniform replaces the mask of a vertiginous society. The uniform is almost the exact opposite of the mask, and always symbolizes a type of authority founded on entirely opposing principles. The mask aimed to dissimulate and terrify. It signified the eruption of a fearful, capricious, intermittent, and inordinate power, which emerged to evoke pious terror in the profane masses and to punish them for their imprudence and their faults. The uniform is also a disguise, but it is official, permanent, regulated, and, above all, leaves the face exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;The only difference in Hong Kong’s case, of course, is that even the uniformed individual is masked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;For now, anger runs high in Hong Kong. Protests &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1484252-20191004.htm?spTabChangeable=0&quot;&gt;spontaneously popped up across the city&lt;/a&gt; before and immediately after the official announcement of the ban, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maryhui/status/1179753624051699713&quot;&gt;calls for a large, masked rally&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday (Oct. 6) in full defiance of the new law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Their faith in the mask as a counterweight to state power finds echoes in a series of large-scale anti-capitalism demonstrations that took place around the world in June 1999. One unnamed, masked activist who took part in a protest in London &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no8/carnival.html&quot;&gt;had this to say&lt;/a&gt;:  “Today we shall give this resistance a face; for by putting on our masks we reveal our unity; and by raising our voices in the street together, we speak our anger at the facelessness of power.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In the Pancreas, Common Fungi May Drive Cancer</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/health/pancreatic-cancer-fungi.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/health/pancreatic-cancer-fungi.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By now, you’ve probably heard that your body is teeming with bacteria. Some 100 trillion of them live on your skin, in your mouth and in the coils of your intestines. Some protect against infections and help you digest food, while others can make you seriously ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Fungi, viruses and protozoa call your body their home, too. Your fungal residents are less numerous than your bacteria by orders of magnitude, but as researchers are learning, these overlooked organisms play an important physiological role — and when their numbers get out of whack, they can modify your immune system and even influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1608-2&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that fungi can make their way deep into the pancreas, which sits behind your stomach and secretes digestive enzymes into your small intestine. In mice and human patients with pancreatic cancer, the fungi proliferate 3,000-fold compared to healthy tissue — and one fungus in particular may make pancreatic tumors grow bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Researchers were surprised by the presence of fungi in the typical pancreas and immense increase in their numbers in disease. “The pancreas was considered a sterile organ until a couple years ago,” said Dr. George Miller, a surgical oncologist at the New York University School of Medicine who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6225783/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; from Dr. Miller’s lab and others had indicated that some microorganisms, such as bacteria, could sneak past a muscle called the sphincter of Oddi, which separates the pancreas from the rest of the gut. Perhaps fungi could also colonize the pancreas the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To find out, Dr. Miller and his team fed mice a species of brewer’s yeast labeled with a green fluorescent protein. The fluorescent marker revealed that the yeast had indeed moved from the digestive tract to the pancreas in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In mice, the types of fungi that ended up in the pancreas were usually very different from those that remained in the gut. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the only varieties of fungi that colonized pancreatic tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One particular fungus was the most abundant in the pancreas: a genus of Basidiomycota called Malassezia, which is typically found on the skin and scalp of animals and humans, and can cause skin irritation and dandruff. A few studies have also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/health/fungus-microbiome-bowel-disease.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;linked the yeast to inflammatory bowel diseases&lt;/a&gt;, but the new finding is the first to link it to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The results show that Malassezia was not only abundant in mice that got pancreatic tumors, it was also present in extremely high numbers in samples from pancreatic cancer patients, said Dr. Berk Aykut, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Miller’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Administering an antifungal drug got rid of the fungi in mice and kept tumors from developing. And when the treated mice again received the yeast, their tumors started growing once more — an indication, Dr. Aykut said, that the fungal cells were driving the tumors’ growth. Infecting a control group of mice with different fungi did not accelerate their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There is increasing scientific consensus that the factors in a tumor’s “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381164/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;microenvironment&lt;/a&gt;” are just as important as the genetic factors driving its growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have to move from thinking about tumor cells alone to thinking of the whole neighborhood that the tumor lives in,” said Dr. Brian Wolpin, a gastrointestinal cancer researcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The surrounding healthy tissue, immune cells, collagen and other fibers holding the tumor, as well as the blood vessels feeding it all help support or prevent the growth of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microbes are one more factor to consider in the alphabet soup of factors affecting cancer proliferation. The fungal population in the pancreas may be a good biomarker for who’s at risk for developing cancer, as well as a potential target for future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is an enormous opportunity for intervention and prevention, which is something we don’t really have for pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue, a pancreatic cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nearly 57,000 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the United States this year, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/well/live/why-cant-we-stop-pancreatic-cancer.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;but their prognosis will be poor&lt;/a&gt;. Three-fourths die within a year of diagnosis, and only about 1 in 10 live longer than five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“That’s because we don’t have any screening or methods of early detection for pancreatic cancer,” said Lynne Elmore, director of the translational cancer research program at the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the time the cancer is diagnosed, surgery alone isn’t enough. Standard chemotherapies are very limited, and there aren’t any great targeted therapies, Dr. Elmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new study also sheds light on how fungi in the pancreas may drive the growth of tumors. The fungi activate an immune system protein called mannose-binding lectin, which then triggers a cascade of signals known to cause inflammation. When the researchers compromised the ability of the lectin protein to do its job, the cancer stopped progressing and the mice survived for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the interaction between microbes and their hosts is extremely complex, Dr. Miller said, and further experiments will be needed before the new findings can be applied in treating cancer patients. Microbial populations can change in response to a person’s age, diet, use of antibiotics or antifungal drugs and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is intriguing and exciting research,” said Dr. Ami Bhatt, who studies microbes at Stanford University. “But it’s probably too soon to add broad spectrum antifungals, many of which have lots of side effects, to cancer treatment regimens, even in experimental settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Why does 1.1.1.1 not resolve archive.is?</title>
<link>https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/135222/why-does-1-1-1-1-not-resolve-archive-is/135223#135223</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/135222/why-does-1-1-1-1-not-resolve-archive-is/135223#135223</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting question, and I've given it a lot of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one sentence answer is &quot;because &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.cloudflare.com/t/archive-is-error-1001/18227/8&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;archive.is blocks DNS requests from Cloudflare's datacenters&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. That of course leads to the core question: &quot;why?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior of archive.is is especially intriguing to me because archive.is seems to have an emphasis on being anti-censorship and being resilient, but blocking 1.1.1.1 users appears antithetical to that. cnst's answer is definitely interesting and plausible, but I've come up with my own pet hypothesis that's somewhat similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you operate a website, and must censor illegal content. You might come up with 3 rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If content is illegal in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, that content must not be served to users in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If content is illegal in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, that content must never touch servers in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. So it must not be stored on those servers, nor be proxied through those servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If content is legal in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, we will attempt (within reason) to make that content available to users in country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simple example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a simple example: you have a piece of content &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; that is illegal in every country in the world except country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. How can we operate our website within the stated rules? This is fairly simple, put all our servers in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, and if a request for &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; comes from country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, serve it. If a request for &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; comes from country &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, give a 404.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complex example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's have a more complicated example: you have a piece of content &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; that is illegal in every country in the world except country &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. You have a piece of content &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; that is illegal in every country in the world except country &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;. Now there's no longer a simple solution. But here's a complicated solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operate servers in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; that have &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. If servers in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; receive a request for &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, serve it. If servers in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; receive a request for &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from outside &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, give a 404. And similarly for &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. If any servers receive a request for content they don't have they give a 404.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operate a custom authoritative DNS server for your site. If it receives a DNS request with the EDNS as an IP in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, respond with the IP address of a server in &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. If it receives a DNS request with the EDNS as an IP in &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, respond with the IP address of a server in &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;. If it receives a DNS request with the EDNS as an IP in some non-&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and non-&lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; country, arbitrarily choose a server IP address to respond with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloudflare enters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to actually implement that solution, you will have a problem: some DNS resolvers (such as 1.1.1.1) don't give you the EDNS, so it's not possible. So archive.is might have done this, then realized that it fails for some DNS resolvers, and so rather than have a semi-broken site, they decided to block users who use those resolvers. There is still the open question though about why block only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; EDNS-less resolvers (such as 1.1.1.1) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19830258&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;not &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; EDNS-less resovers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found some evidence in favor of this explanation of archive.is's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archive.is runs some special DNS servers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/archiveis/status/1090794206241673216&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Linode and DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;. When Linode &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/laORH&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; that these DNS servers were used in some way to help distribute controversial content, archive.is defended themselves by saying those servers are just DNS servers, content never touches those servers. This defense uses the same reasoning as rule 2 from above, namely that what matters is whether the content touches the specific servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in that same conversation, Linode complained that archive.is was doing blocking based on user IP. Archive.is responded that yes, they do censorship based on the country the user is in. This is very similar behavior to what I proposed in the complex solution. As an interesting side note, archive.is viewed this type of censorship as &lt;em&gt;improving&lt;/em&gt; legality by ensuring users didn't see banned content, whereas Linode viewed this exact same behavior as &lt;em&gt;hurting&lt;/em&gt; legality, by obfuscating behavior, hiding evidence, and making it hard for Linode to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archive.is says they are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/archiveis/status/1091022530184445953&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;modern deployment tools&lt;/a&gt; and the highly competitive cloud market to prevent wrongful takedowns, which could indicate a complicated setup with servers across many countries and some sort of orchestration system to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't know for certain archive.is's reasoning for their behavior because they haven't fully explained themselves. If their reasoning is legal-based, maybe they fear that explaining their legal setup will expose legal holes in their setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaps in explanation that archive.is has left provide an opportunity for some interesting technical and philosophical speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Caddy Proposal: Permanently change all proprietary licensing to open source</title>
<link>https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/2786</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/2786</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;We (Light Code Labs in partnership with Ardan Labs) have decided that &lt;strong&gt;we would like to make all Caddy code open source and permanently remove all proprietary licensing within the project&lt;/strong&gt;, effective as soon as this proposal is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like the community's feedback on these plans, which are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reaffirm that Caddy is an Apache 2.0-licensed open source project (&lt;strong&gt;this is unchanged&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Caddy binaries remain open source, Apache 2.0-licensed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All official, enterprise-only v2 plugins that were to be reserved for business customers be&lt;br/&gt;released under the same open source license and moved into open repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop plans for &quot;Caddy Enterprise&quot; branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite the community to collaborate in the development of &lt;em&gt;all of Caddy&lt;/em&gt;, including former-Enterprise-only features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop all build server subscriptions, startup packages, and private plugin hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to the website, our plans are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove all use case restrictions from the build server (download page and getcaddy.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate all mentions of products, business licensing, and subscriptions from the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the current website to &lt;code&gt;caddyserver.com/v1&lt;/code&gt; with redirects for most URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put up a v2 website at &lt;code&gt;caddyserver.com&lt;/code&gt; that reflects the values, features, and benefits of the new Caddy project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Support/Contact link for companies who require support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Ardan Labs' logo to broadcast our close relationship with Ardan Labs, and to make it clear that this open source project is backed by a trusted company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ardan Labs as our official partner for the Caddy project, we are ready to support the enterprise use cases. Ardan Labs is world-renowned for their Go training and support in the enterprise setting. We are confident that businesses will love using Caddy 2 once they try it, and we look forward to supporting their production use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans for businesses are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light Code Labs will continue supporting our current v1 customers until their subscriptions expire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Ardan Labs expertise to serve our clients with what they require -- whether it be 24/7 on-call support, custom feature development, training, and/or installation help or consultation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Code Labs may seek sponsorships to help back the ongoing, full-time open source development of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Code Labs will reach out to our current customers to let them know about these changes and help them understand these improved support options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to Caddy v2, our plans are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release a new beta version approximately every Monday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release RC1 by the end of the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release stable 2.0 in Q1 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want the world to know that Caddy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;is open source for good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not a toy project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has corporate backing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be used without hassle or worry in both small business and enterprise environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can support enterprise use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope these changes will make this vision for the new Caddy project a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit your votes and feedback in this issue, and share it as widely as you can because this is the culmination of many years' efforts from ourselves and many of you! Thank you to everyone involved!&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't walk for two years. I forgot what it is to stand, I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a lot longer to learn how to control the arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very difficult because it is a combination of multiple muscles and movements. This is the most impressive thing I do with the exoskeleton.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How good is the exoskeleton?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 65kg of sophisticated robotics is not completely restoring function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is a marked advance on similar approaches that allow people to control a single limb with their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20731973&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Paralysed woman's thoughts control robotic arm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thibault does need to be attached to a ceiling-harness in order to minimise the risk of him falling over in the exoskeleton - it means the device is not yet ready to move outside the laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is far from autonomous walking,&quot; Prof Alim-Louis Benabid, the president of the Clinatec executive board, told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He does not have the quick and precise movements not to fall, nobody on earth does this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tasks where Thibault had to touch specific targets by using the exoskeleton to move his upper and lower arms and rotate his wrists, he was successful 71% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Benabid, who developed deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, told the BBC: &quot;We have solved the problem and shown the principle is correct. This is proof we can extend the mobility of patients in an exoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is in [the] direction of giving better quality of life.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What is the next step?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French scientists say they can continue to refine the technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment they are limited by the amount of data they can read from the brain, send to a computer, interpret and send to the exoskeleton in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have 350 milliseconds to go from thought to movement otherwise the system becomes difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means out of the 64 electrodes on each implant, the researchers are using only 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there is still the potential to read the brain in more detail using more powerful computers and AI to interpret the information from the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also plans to develop finger control to allow Thibault to pick up and move objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has already used the implant to control a wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Are there more sinister roles for this technology?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are scientists investigating ways of using exoskeletons to enhance human abilities, a field known as transhumanism, rather than overcome paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-exoskeleton/pentagon-looks-to-exoskeletons-to-build-super-soldiers-idUSKCN1NY2Y4&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;military applications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are absolutely not going in the direction of these extreme and stupid applications,&quot; Prof Benabid told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our job is to repair the injured patients who have lost function.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What do experts think?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tom Shakespeare, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said while this study presents a &quot;welcome and exciting advance&quot;, proof of concept was a long way from usable clinical possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A danger of hype always exists in this field. Cost constraints mean that hi-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 15% of people with disabilities had a wheelchair or other assistive devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the exoskeleton have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(19)30321-7/fulltext&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;published in The Lancet Neurology&lt;/a&gt; journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamestgallagher?lang=en&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;James on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
