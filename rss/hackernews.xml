<title>Show HN: Lunar lander-type game with computational fluid dynamics</title>
<link>https://github.com/s-macke/Interplanetary-Postal-Service/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/s-macke/Interplanetary-Postal-Service/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/s-macke/Interplanetary-Postal-Service/blob/master/images/IPShigh.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/s-macke/Interplanetary-Postal-Service/raw/master/images/IPShigh.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ingame Image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://js13kgames.com/entries/interplanetary-postal-service&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; to the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://js13kgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;js13kgames&lt;/a&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a postman of the Interplanetary Postal Service your task is to deliver precious mails to our distant colonies. This game lets you control a lander module on the last miles to the colony. You must not only fight against gravity, but also against dangerous winds. Play through 8 uniquely designed levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control the game with your arrow keys or with WASD. Press Space to toggle sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluid dynamics in a game, that was the goal. Not just a fake one. I wanted it real. Solving the real equations. So far I have only encountered two games with real fluid dynamics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_Pong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plasma Pong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PixelJunk_Shooter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pixeljunk Shooter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the last one is great and had motivated me for this game. Then the decision for a game type was easy. I chose a game from my distant path: Lunar Lander. The game type fits perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you decide to implement fluid dynamics you need one thing more than anything: speed. To write also tiny code you have to either program directly in the web assembler language or use a language with a really small footprint. That language is C without using any libraries. I used the emscripten emcc compiler and throwed away all Javascript overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to save space and for speed you have to define you own math functions with the desired accuracy. For example the exp function takes needs only a few bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;expf_fast&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; a)
{
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; f; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; x; } u;
  u.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; = (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;12102203&lt;/span&gt; * a + &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1064866805&lt;/span&gt;);
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; u.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fluid dynamics is a combination of code and knowledge from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to describe exactly what you have to do here. You have to solve the Navier-Stokes equations on a grid. The grid size here is 256 x 128. The compiled fluid dynamics code requires about 3-4kB of compressed space. I simulate 3 colored fluids: The thrust of the ship, the main fluid of the level and the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics consists of three layers. The first one is the canvas (256 x 128) used by the webassembly code. It contains the basic background and the fluid. The second canvas contains the level map and the ship sprite. The third layers is an SVG overlay and shows the text and the velocity and fuel display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For collision detection I decided for a trivial but pixel perfect technique. The collision detection was done by drawing a canvas and counting the boundary pixels. If the ship sprite overlaps with the boundary, the number of boundary pixels decrease indicating an collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map is stored as a bitfield of size 32x17. So each map requires only 68 byte of space. This field is expanded over an gaussian kernel and some random texture on top. Together with trivial lightning you get a pretty decend and cheap level design. Here is an example of a map. A '*' is a one. A '-' is a zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;********************************

*********------------------*****
-------------------------*******
---------------------***********
-------------------*************
-------------------------*******
*************------------*******
********************************
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound is implemented very easy. You just take white noise and run it through an band-filter. Wind has a peak frequency of around 500Hz. Explosion and thrust work at 100Hz with different peak widths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the game was the most difficult part. The flow dynamics are not always controllable and the result varies depending on the FPS and your actions. Tiny changes on the algorithms or the free parameters let you redesign and balance all levels again and again. Although the game is challenging, I usually manage all levels on the first or second try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end I realized that even without any massive compression tricks I had 3 kBs of available space left. I tried to introduce a touchpad control for mobiles. But then I realized, that most mobiles simply don't have enough power to run the game. Then I tried to introduce music. But my so called &quot;music&quot; made the experience much worse :-). So I skipped that two options. I tried to introduce more levels. You can put 6-10 levels in 3 kB. But then I ran out of time. Polishing surely would have taken another one or two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(US Navy/released)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early weeks of April, 1975 found the USS Midway steaming towards the coast of South Vietnam to link up with a number of other warships including the USS Coral Sea and the USS Enterprise of Task Force 76, standing by to support Operation Frequent Wind, a mass evacuation of all American nationals and as many South Vietnamese military personnel (and their families) as possible during the North Vietnamese Army’s final push into the South. Reaching its station on the 19th, the Midway had previously offloaded half of its air wing at Subic Bay on its way to Vietnam and her sailors were prepping to receive thousands of evacuees in the coming days. To assist with the evacuation, ten massive US Air Force Sikorsky HH-53C Super Jolly Green Giants were loaded onto the Midway while at Subic. On the 29th, orders were handed down from higher- Operation Frequent Wind was a go. It was on that very day that Major Buang Lee (also spelled as Buang-Ly in a number of other accounts) of the South Vietnamese Air Force unintentionally had his name etched into the record books by attempting and completing one of the weirdest carrier landings in history aboard Chambers’ ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;U.S. Air Force Sikorsky HH-53C Super Jolly Green Giant helicopters on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Midway (CV-41) during en:Operation Frequent Wind, April 1975. (U.S. Navy/released)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the war in Vietnam, a fairly sizable number of Republic of Vietnam Military Forces (the South) officers and senior enlisted soldiers/airmen, as well as their families, were marked for death. Their civilian peers in the South were especially fearful of reprisal from the invading North Vietnamese Army for supporting and harboring ranking RVNMF personnel, who were often unceremoniously dragged out from their houses and shot in the streets, their bodies left to rot as both a warning to anyone who wouldn’t give up RVNMF troops and to the soldiers themselves that their demise was imminent. Anyone who was seen or thought to have aided the United States in any way, shape or form, was hunted down and mercilessly slaughtered. The US military offered a way, during Frequent Wind, for these men and their families to flee to safety. Their places of refuge were the decks of US Navy vessels floating off the coast of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Buang Lee, a young officer with the Vietnam Air Force, was extremely worried for the safety of his wife and five children. If Northern soldiers came across them, or their neighbors gave them up, torture and execution was the brutal fate that awaited them. Unwilling to let this happen, he crammed all of them into a small Cessna O-1 Bird Dog parked on an airfield ramp on Con Son Island and took off. The Bird Dog was the military version of the Cessna 170 and it generally flew with two crew- a pilot and an observer; Lee’s Bird Dog was packed with seven people, including the pilot. After lifting off from Con Son, the Bird Dog took fire but was miraculously left unscathed. The plan was to fly out and hopefully find an American warship, ditch the aircraft and swim to safety. If they couldn’t find a ship, they wouldn’t have any other option than to ditch anyways. Luckily, the Lee family spotted a cluster of vessels in the distance, and twisted the aircraft in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboard the Midway, Frequent Wind was winding down. South Vietnamese and American UH-1 Hueys, previously hauling over evacuees, were chained to the flight deck while crew moved to-and-fro in the light rain soaking the carrier. The bridge of the Midway received reports of an approaching small aircraft, though they were unable to determine its origin and intentions. Observers with powerful binoculars spotted the Bird Dog from a distance, which proceeded towards the large flattop, slowly but surely. Lee flipped on the O-1’s landing lights, and banked into a small pattern above the ship, circling overhead. Chambers, up on the bridge of the Midway in the captain’s chair, was understandably extremely confused but also on the edge of his seat, trying to figure out if the small aircraft meant the Midway and her crew harm, or otherwise. He ordered the communications center to hail the Bird Dog on all frequencies and channels, but their attempts were met with static and a lack of response. The confusion quickly lifted when Chambers and the other officers on the bridge realized that that the Cessna contained more than just the pilot; there were children and a woman aboard as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to establish radio contact with the ship below him, Lee decided on a more rudimentary approach. Scribbling a note describing his situation on a piece of paper taken from the Bird Dog’s cockpit, he swooped in low over the flight deck and tossed it out of the window, hoping that someone would be able to catch it. This attempt, along with a second try failed as both notes blew over the side of the ship before the flight deck crew could get them. Now with less than an hour’s worth of fuel remaining in his tanks, Lee decided to add some weight to the third note, penned onto a map from the cockpit. Attaching it to his service pistol, he once again made a low pass over the carrier and dropped it out before climbing away. This time, the deck crew got a hold of it and immediately brought it to the carrier’s island, and then up to the bridge to Chambers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chambers called an impromptu meeting with the Midway’s Air Boss and the commanding officer of the Midway Carrier Task Force, Admiral William L. Harris. Outlining the situation that was unfolding right in front of their eyes, they quickly determined that the passengers of the Bird Dog had a very slim chance of survival if they ditched in the South China Sea, next to the carrier. Air Boss Vern Jumper and Harris concurred with Chambers that giving the Bird Dog a green light to land directly aboard the vessel would be the better alternative. Chambers did so and immediately put the ship’s crew into high gear. They had their work cut out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Frequent Wind and the gradual cessation of evacuation operations, the Midway had barely been making steerageway- just enough forward movement to helm the ship effectively. There was no real need for the ship to be moving any faster, as it was only supposed to be operating helicopters for the duration of Frequent Wind. Normally, it would have had to generate winds over the flight deck, so as to launch fixed-wing aircraft from its catapults, but helos didn’t need such a provision. Chambers had therefore allowed the ship’s engineering crew to partially shut down the powerplant for maintenance, upon their request. Now in need of speed to assist with Lee’s landing, Chambers got the Midway’s chief engineer on the line and asked that he be given enough steam to increase the ship’s speed to 25 knots. Due to the partial shutdown, this wouldn’t be possible right away, so Chambers had the engineering crew shift the hotel load (electricity used for every other purpose aboard the ship than propulsion) to the emergency diesel engines while cranking up the main powerplant. With that issue solved, another problem was manifesting itself outside on the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Frequent Wind was coming to a close, helos were still flying to the ship. Chambers ordered all available hands to the flight deck, regardless of rank, to assist in moving any aircraft parked on the deck to a different spot, clearing a long strip for Lee to land on. Any helo that couldn’t be moved in a safe and timely manner was to be pushed over the side of the deck after a quick gear strip. An estimated $10 million worth of South Vietnamese UH-1Hs were thus stripped and jettisoned from the flight deck. When five more South Vietnamese Hueys landed on the deck during the mad dash to clear the deck, their occupants were hustled into the ship and their helos met the same fate as the others. Meanwhile, the arresting gear, strung across the angled deck of the Midway were also removed, lest Lee’slanding gear get fouled in the cables during his landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a keen eye on the deck, Lee brought his Bird Dog around and lined up with the ship, approaching just above stall speed. Chambers later recalled that Buang’s relative speed wasn’t more than 20 to 25 knots. As if he had practiced it a dozen times, Lee set the aircraft down on the flight deck and rapidly came to a halt amid the shouts and yells of the crew assembled on the deck to help facilitate the Bird Dog’s recovery. Many of the crew agreed- if Buang had a tailhook on his aircraft, he would have undoubtedly bagged the third wire (the the ideal wire for a textbook carrier landing). Shaking, but thoroughly relieved, Lee and his family emerged from the Bird Dog and were taken inside the ship’s island right away, where they met an equally-relieved Captain Chambers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of frightening odds, Lee’s story ended spectacularly well. The crew of the Midway unanimously donated money towards a fund that would help the Lee family settle in the United States after claiming refugee status, which they were able to, upon reaching the US. Captain Chambers’ actions could have very well had him court-martialled and killed off his career in the Navy, and he was well aware of that. Even still, he put his livelihood on the line and took the necessary actions to save the Lee family. Thankfully, Chambers was able to retire from the Navy later on after achieving flag rank and becoming a Rear Admiral. Years later, he would reunite with the Lee family, still ever grateful for Chambers and the Midway’s crew, and just what they did to save their lives on that overcast April day in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google throws away 12 years of work by investors (Portfolios in Google Finance)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to Google Finance the other day to see how a hypothetical portfolio invested in 2012 would have done. This is something that I took the time to type in back in 2012. I discovered that keeping a database of a few symbols and numbers and doing a multiplication is too onerous for folks at Google (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2017/08/07/casting-out-the-heretic-at-google/&quot;&gt;they’re busy stamping out heresy?&lt;/a&gt;). So they have thrown out my work. Here are a few articles on this attack on human productivity by Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we combine this with Google’s destruction of millions of person-years of (part-time) work in Picasa, is the only reasonable conclusion that Google has re-hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer&quot;&gt;Marissa Mayer&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers: How would you track a hypothetical investment, including reinvestment of any dividends? Especially in a mutual fund ticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://momentjs.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moment.js&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic time &amp;amp; date library with lots of great features and utilities. However, if you are working on a performance sensitive web application, it might cause a huge performance overhead because of its complex APIs and large bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs/blob/master/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs/raw/master/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Large bundle size&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems with Moment.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only using some simple functions from moment.js might be considered overkill. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs&quot;&gt;dayjs&lt;/a&gt; has a smaller core and has very similar APIs so it makes it very easy to migrate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns&quot;&gt;date-fns&lt;/a&gt; enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/275#issuecomment-264934189&quot;&gt;tree-shaking and other benefits&lt;/a&gt; so that it works great with React, Sinon.js, and webpack, etc. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/2373&quot;&gt;https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/2373&lt;/a&gt; for more ideas on why and how people switch from moment.js to other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s bring back the Sabbath as an act against ‘total work’</title>
<link>https://aeon.co/ideas/lets-bring-back-the-sabbath-as-a-radical-act-against-total-work</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aeon.co/ideas/lets-bring-back-the-sabbath-as-a-radical-act-against-total-work</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a boy in late-1940s Memphis, my dad got a nickel every Friday evening to come by the home of a Russian Jewish immigrant named Harry Levenson and turn on his lights, since the Torah forbids lighting a fire in your home on the Sabbath. My father would wonder, however, if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; were somehow sinning. The fourth commandment says that on the Sabbath ‘you shall not do any work – you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns’. Was my dad Levenson’s &lt;em&gt;slave&lt;/em&gt;? If so, how come he could turn on Levenson’s lights? Were they &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; going to hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy.’ The commandment smacks of obsolete puritanism – the shuttered liquor store, the cheque sitting in a darkened post office. We usually encounter the Sabbath as an inconvenience, or at best a nice idea increasingly at odds with reality. But observing this weekly day of rest can actually be a radical act. Indeed, what makes it so obsolete and impractical is precisely what makes it so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taken seriously, the Sabbath has the power to restructure not only the calendar but also the entire political economy. In place of an economy built upon the profit motive – the ever-present need for more, in fact the need for there to never be enough – the Sabbath puts forward an economy built upon the belief that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; enough. But few who observe the Sabbath are willing to consider its full implications, and therefore few who do not observe it have reason to find any value in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath’s radicalism should be no surprise given the fact that it originated among a community of former slaves. The 10 commandments constituted a manifesto against the regime that they had recently escaped, and rebellion against that regime was at the heart of their god’s identity, as attested to in the first commandment: ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.’ When the ancient Israelites swore to worship only one god, they understood this to mean, in part, they owed no fealty to the pharaoh or any other emperor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore instructive to read the fourth commandment in light of the pharaoh’s labour practices described earlier in the book of Exodus. He is depicted as a manager never satisfied with his slaves, especially those building the structures for storing surplus grain. The pharaoh orders that the slaves no longer be given straw with which to make bricks; they must now gather their own straw, while the daily quota for bricks would remain the same. When many fail to meet their quota, the pharaoh has them beaten and calls them lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth commandment presents a god who, rather than demanding ever more work, insists on rest. The weekly Sabbath placed a hard limit on how much work could be done and suggested that this was perfectly all right; enough work was done in the other six days. And whereas the pharaoh relaxed while his people toiled, Yahweh insisted that the people rest as Yahweh rested: ‘For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath, as described in Exodus and other passages in the Torah, had a democratising effect. Yahweh’s example – not forcing others to labour while Yahweh rested – was one anybody in power was to imitate. It was not enough for you to rest; your children, slaves, livestock and even the ‘aliens’ in your towns were to rest as well. The Sabbath wasn’t just a time for personal reflection and rejuvenation. It wasn’t self-care. It was for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a reason the fourth commandment came where it did, bridging the commandments on how humans should relate to God with the commandments on how humans should relate to one another. As the Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann points out in his book &lt;em&gt;Sabbath as Resistance&lt;/em&gt; (2014), a pharaonic economy driven by anxiety begets violence, dishonesty, jealousy, theft, the commodification of sex and familial alienation. None of these had a place in the Torahic economy, which was driven not by anxiety but by wholeness, enoughness. In such a society, there was no need to murder, covet, lie, commit adultery or dishonour one’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath’s centrality to the Torahic economy was made clearer in other laws building upon the fourth commandment. Every seventh year, the Israelites were to let their fields ‘rest and lie fallow, so that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the wild animals may eat’. And every 50th year, they were to not only let their fields lie fallow, but forgive all debts; all slaves were to be freed and returned to their families, and all land returned to its original inhabitants. This was a far cry from the pharaonic regime where surplus grain was hoarded and parsed out to the poor only in exchange for work and loyalty. There were no strings attached; the goal wasn’t accumulating power but reconciling the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t is unknown if these radical commandments were ever followed to the letter. In any case, they are certainly not now. The Sabbath was desacralised into the weekend, and this desacralisation paved the way for the disappearance of the weekend altogether. The decline of good full-time work and the rise of the gig economy mean that we must relentlessly hustle and never rest. Why haven’t you answered that email? Couldn’t you be doing something more productive with your time? Bring your phone with you to the bathroom so you can at least keep busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expected to compete with each other for our own labour, so that we each become our own taskmaster, our own pharaoh. Offer your employer more and more work for the same amount of pay, so that you undercut your competition – more and more bricks, and you’ll even bring your own straw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our neo-pharaonic economy, we are worth no more than the labour we can perform, and the value of our labour is being ever devalued. We can never work enough. A profit-driven capitalist society depends on the anxious striving for more, and it would break down if there were ever enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath has no place in such a society and indeed upends its most basic tenets. In a Sabbatarian economy, the right to rest – the right to do nothing of value to capital – is as holy as the right to work. We can give freely to the poor and open our homes to refugees without being worried that there will be nothing left for us. We can erase all debts from our records, because it is necessary for the community to be whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for us, whatever our religious beliefs, to see the Sabbatarian laws of old not as backward and pharisaical, but rather as the liberatory statements they were meant to be. It is time to ask what our society would look like if it made room for a new Sabbath – or, to put it a different way, what our society would &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to look like for the Sabbath to be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The iPhone SE was the best phone Apple ever made, and now it’s dead</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/the-iphone-se-was-the-best-phone-apple-ever-made-and-now-its-dead/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/the-iphone-se-was-the-best-phone-apple-ever-made-and-now-its-dead/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I only wanted one thing out of 2018’s iPhone event: a new iPhone SE. In failing to provide it &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; seems to have quietly put the model out to pasture — and for this I curse them eternally. Because it was the best phone the company ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were one of the many who passed over the SE back in 2015, when it made its debut, that’s understandable. The iPhone 6S was the latest and greatest, and of course fixed a few of the problems Apple had kindly introduced with the entirely new design of the 6. But for me the SE was a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I’ve always loved the iPhone design that began with the 4. That storied phone is perhaps best remembered for being left in a bar ahead of release and leaked by Gizmodo — which is too bad, because for once the product was worthy of the lavish unveiling Apple now bestows on every device it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4 established an entirely new industrial design aesthetic that was at once instantly recognizable and highly practical. Gone were the smooth, rounded edges and back of the stainless original iPhone (probably the second-best phone Apple made) and the jellybean-esque 3G and 3GS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712370&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;In the place of those soft curves were hard lines and uncompromising geometry: a belt of metal running around the edge, set off from the glass sides by the slightest of steps. It highlighted and set off the black glass of the screen and bezel, producing a of specular outline from any angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera was flush and the home button (RIP) sub-flush, entirely contained within the body, making the device perfectly flat both front and back. Meanwhile the side buttons boldly stood out. Volume in bold, etched circles; the mute switch easy to find but impossible to accidentally activate; the power button perfectly placed for a reaching index finger. Note that all these features are directly pointed at usability: making things easier, better, more accessible, while also being attractive and cohesive as parts of a single object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the iPhone 4, every single other phone, including Samsung’s new “iPhone killer” Galaxy S, was a cheap-looking mess of plastic, incoherently designed or at best workmanlike. And don’t think I’m speaking as an Apple fanboy; I was not an iPhone user at the time. In fact, I was probably still using &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/requiem-for-the-g1/&quot;&gt;my beloved G1&lt;/a&gt; — talk about beauty and the beast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design was strong enough that it survived the initially awkward transition to a longer screen in the 5, and with that generation it also gained the improved rear side that alleviated the phone’s unfortunate tendency towards… well, shattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712374&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;664&quot;/&gt;The two-tone grey iPhone 5S, however, essentially left no room for improvement. And after 4 years, it was admittedly perhaps time to freshen things up a bit. Unfortunately, what Apple ended up doing was subtracting all personality from the device while adding nothing but screen space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 was, to me, simply ugly. It was reminiscent of the plethora of boring Android phones at the time — merely higher quality than them, not different. The 6S was similarly ugly, and the 7 through 8 somehow further banished any design that set themselves apart, while reversing course on some practical measures in allowing an increasingly large camera bump and losing the headphone jack. The X, at least, looked a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712372&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;But to return to the topic at hand, it was after the 6S that Apple had introduced the SE. Although it nominally stood for “Special Edition,” the name was also a nod to the Macintosh SE. Ironically given the original meaning of “System Expansion,” the new SE was the opposite: essentially an iPhone 6S in the body of a 5S, complete with improved camera, Touch ID sensor, and processor. The move was likely intended as a sort of lifeboat for users who still couldn’t bring themselves to switch to the drastically redesigned, and considerably larger, new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take time, Apple seems to have reasoned, to convert these people, the types who rarely buy first generation Apple products and cherish usability over novelty. So why not coddle them a bit through this difficult transition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SE appealed not just to the nostalgic and neophobic, but simply people who prefer a smaller phone. I don’t have particularly large or small hands, but I preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712373&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;643&quot;/&gt;Flush camera so it doesn’t get scratched up? Check. Normal, pressable home button? Check. Flat, symmetrical design? Check. Actual edges to hold onto? Check. Thousands of cases already available? Check — although I didn’t use one for a long time. The SE is best without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the iPhone SE was more compact and better looking than anything Apple offered, while making almost no compromises at all in terms of functionality. The only possible objection was its size, and that was (and is) a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the best object Apple ever designed, filled with the best tech it had ever developed. It was the best phone it ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712371&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iphone_se-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot;/&gt;And the best phone it’s made &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; then, too, if you ask me. Ever since the 6, it seems to me that Apple has only drifted, casting about for something to captivate its users the way the iPhone 4’s design and new graphical capabilities did, all the way back in 2010. It honed that design to a cutting edge and then, when everyone expected the company to leap forward, it tiptoed instead, perhaps afraid to spook the golden goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the SE was Apple allowing itself one last victory lap on the back of a design it would never surpass. It’s understandable that it would not want to admit, this many years on, that anyone could possibly prefer something it created nearly a decade ago to its thousand-dollar flagship — a device, I feel I must add, that not only compromises visibly in its design (I’ll never own a notched phone if I can help it) but backpedals on practical features used by millions, like Touch ID and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This is in keeping with similarly user-unfriendly choices made elsewhere in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I am disappointed in Apple, I’m not surprised. After all, it’s disappointed me for years. But I still have my SE, and I intend to keep it for as long as possible. Because it’s the best thing the company ever made, and it’s still a hell of a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>I only wanted one thing out of 2018's iPhone event: a new iPhone SE. In failing to provide it Apple seems to have quietly put the model out to pasture — and for this I curse them eternally. Because it was the best phone the company ever made.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Layers provide a way to map multiple functions to a single key. Think of the Fn key of laptops, but unlike laptops, there is not one but three layer-switcher keys, namely Mod, Fn, and Mouse. These three, in addition to the Base Layer, give you four separate layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please realize that touch typists all around the world only utilize nine of their ten fingers on regular keyboards because everyone presses space with either the left or right thumb, leaving the other thumb unutilized. The Mod keys are strategically placed so that both of your thumbs can be utilized, allowing you to reach the Mod layer’s navigation functionality quicker than navigating on regular keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>x86 finds its way into the iPhone</title>
<link>https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lcq2.github.io/x86_iphone/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my several lives, I’m supposed to be a vulnerability researcher working on baseband exploitation. As every vulnerability researcher knows, being up to date with recent developments is of utmost importance for the success of your job. So of course, after Apple announced its new, shiny, big, bigger and biggest line of iPhone smartphones, I downloaded some OTA firmwares from ipsw.me and started to look into the new baseband firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered sent a shiver of horror down my spine, the kind of horror that only playing Doom at nighttime, alone in your room, without lights, can produce. Bear with me and I’ll tell you what I found…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;: this is just some preliminary analysis and I’m not going to describe anything related to baseband rerversing, it’s not the scope of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whowhatwhere&quot;&gt;Who/What/Where?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseband cpu is a standalone core that lives in your phone and is responsible for managing 2g/3g/4g/cdma/5g wireless communications. Given the absurd complexity of these standards, today a baseband cpu must be very powerful and enough general purpose, so the days of custom FPGA based IPs are long gone, at least for the main part. A lot has been said and written about basebands on modern smartphones, so I won’t repeat it. For our purpose, you just need to know that usually basebands are implemented using embedded friendly CPUs, like for example ARM (Cortex-M, Cortex-R or something inbetween), Qualcomm Hexagon (a kind of general purpose, VLIW dsp) or other more or less known architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is nothing special in this regard, up until the iPhone8/iPhoneX, they used to have two different basebands, one for CDMA markets and one for everything else. The CDMA one was based on Qualcomm Hexagon dsp, while the GSM one was based on Intel XMMxxxx architecture. For those that like to play around with iPhone firmwares, you might have seen MAVxxx and ICExxx files in the ipsw, well those two files contain the firmware respectively for Qualcomm based devices (MAV) and Intel based ones (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Apple decided to drop Qualcomm and now they’re using exclusively Intel based basebands, so we will concentrate on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-intel-baseband&quot;&gt;The old Intel baseband&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the old generation of Intel baseband, the one used up to iPhoneX. If you download an ipsw GSM firmware and unzip it (ipsw files are just zip files), there will be, amongst other things, a “Firmware” folder. Inside this folder you will see a couple of files: “ICE17-1.04.52.Release.bbfw” and “Mav17-1.91.00.Release.bbfw”. The version will change of course, these are for iPhone8 with iOS 11.4beta3. Those files are again zip files and we’re interested in ICE17-xxx, let’s unzip it and see the contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lot of stuff here. People familiar with embedded firmware reversing, will set their eyes on “psi_ram.bin” and “ebl.bin” of course. A quick hex dump of their content, will immediately reveal that they contain ARM code. As a matter of fact, “psi_ram.bin” is the stage0 bootloader, that will load “ebl.bin” at some address and jump to its entry point. ebl.bin will then load all other files and jump to the main firmware, contained in SYS_SW.elf. Just to be sure, let us fire IDA and open psi_ram.bin for example, load address does not matter, just set it to 0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing strange here, it’s your standard embedded ARM boot code, with some custom setup related to this specific SoC. Moving on, psi_ram will load ebl and jump into it, you can find the code yourself, is not that complex. The important thing is, this is ARM code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-intel-basebandthe-horrorthe-horror&quot;&gt;The new Intel baseband…the horror…the horror…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning, I wanted to analyse the new baseband firmware, to get an idea of what changed and where. So I downloaded a random OTA for the new iPhones from ipsw.me, in particular: https://ipsw.me/otas/iPhone11,2 , which should be the new iPhone Xs. I went through the usual stages (downloading, unzipping, unzipping, unzipping, copying, etc…), I load psi_ram.bin into IDA, I select ARM little endian, and…huge chunk of undefined data. I press “C” like an idiot for about 200 times, I reload the file multiple times, I try another IDA version, I try to disassemble the bytes with Capstone, I DISASSEMBLE THEM MANUALLY, nothing…all I got was invalid code. So I went back to sleep because obviously it was not a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up again after about an hour, I download again the ipsw for the same model and I go through all the same steps as usual. Still invalid code. My first guess was that the code is encrypted, so I use some random tool to analyse the entropy, nothing, it’s very low. Ok, you cannot trust tools these days, so I wrote my own script to calculate the entropy and again, is too low to be encrypted and anyway, it was also clear by a quick “eye” analysis, even though you should not trust your eyes that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen for several minutes, thinking what the fu** is going on. But of course, as a reverser you should never give up, so I try EVERY POSSIBLE RISC ARCHITECTURE I KNOW, and trust me, there’s a lot of them (no I mean, A LOT, I reversed everything from Dreamcast SH4 to Fujitsu/Siemens running inside my Nikon D90), and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing, all I get is garbage. My next guess is: ok then, it’s encrypted with some entropy-preserving algorithm. I try some cryptoanalisis approaches I know, even though is not my main job and I’m no expert at it, still nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make another coffee and I start to think, in my mind, as a joke: fuck it, this is x86 because Intel has gone insane. I start to laugh maniacally at the idea, but you know, I had tried everything, so I reopen “psi_ram.bin” and I leave the default “MetaPC” architecture in IDA, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not believe my eyes…I was looking at embedded x86 code running inside a baseband processor. I thought that it was just random chance, that somehow I ended up with valid x86 code, so I look at another function (note: IDA automatically resolved most of the code) and….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;holy sh*t…lgdt…mov ds, eax…jmp far ptr 8:xxx, you can’t get more x86 than this. This is no coincidence, this MUST be valid x86 code…I was totally speechless, and partially in awe, because this reminds me of my younger days when I was writing bootloaders and operating systems that run in protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my rational part told me “hey, probably they just decided to boot the system with an embedded x86 mcu, OBVIOUSLY the main firmware still runs on ARM”, so I turn my attention to “SYS_SW.elf”, the main firmware. I look at the ELF header, and it says ARM…good. I load it in IDA, and I get garbage…AGAIN!!!! I think “what.the.fuck” and I try to load it with MetaPC again and…BOOM, valid x86 code! Random snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is awesome…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing really, I just found this funny and wanted to share. If you ever felt like you missed an x86 core in your life, now you have one (or several? I still need to investigate) always with you, so you won’t feel alone ever again. I still did not have time to analyse the other models, but my guess is that they’re also running on x86.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen next? Are we going to get a z80 inside our phones? Why not a 6502? Hell, I would love to run C64 basic interpreter natively inside my phone….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, I’m not criticizing Apple or Intel for using an x86 core, I don’t really care, but…my PERSONAL opinion is that something is going really wrong in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
