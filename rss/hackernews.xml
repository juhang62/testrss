<title>Penguin travels every year to visit man who rescued him (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/dindim-o-lindo-pinguim-1.3487668</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/dindim-o-lindo-pinguim-1.3487668</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ever since a 71-year-old Brazilian man rescued a struggling penguin, he's been receiving regular visits from his feathered friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joao Pereira de Souza, a retired bricklayer, lives on Proveta, a fishing village just off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. In 2011, he spotted a starving Magellanic penguin drenched in oil on the beach near his house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Naming the penguin Dindim, Pereira de Souza fed him every day until he was strong enough to leave, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ciencias.fsa/videos/1039393452790200/&quot;&gt;according to a video from the University of Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. But the penguin refused to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pereira de Souza decided to row a boat out into the water and drop Dindim off to encourage him to swim home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when he rowed back to shore, he found the penguin waiting for him at his shanty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;He stayed with me for 11 months and then, just after he changed his coat with new feathers, he disappeared,&quot; Pereira de Souza told &lt;a href=&quot;http://gshow.globo.com/Bastidores/noticia/2016/03/pinguim-curioso-se-apaixona-por-camera-nos-bastidores-do-domingao-do-faustao-assista.html&quot;&gt;TV Globo, a Brazilian TV network.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magellanic penguins regularly swim thousands of kilometres a year to breeding spots on the coast of Argentina and Chile. From time to time, penguins show up in warmer Brazilian waters, according to the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Pereira de Souza's friends thought that when Dindim finally left, that was it for the human-bird friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a few months later, Dindim returned and found Pereira de Souza. He visits for about four months, a ritual kept for the last five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He arrives in June and leaves to go home in February, and every year he becomes more affectionate, as he appears even happier to see me,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://gshow.globo.com/Bastidores/noticia/2016/03/pinguim-curioso-se-apaixona-por-camera-nos-bastidores-do-domingao-do-faustao-assista.html&quot;&gt;Pereira de Souza told TV Globo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3487812.1457729032!/fileImage/httpImage/image.PNG_gen/derivatives/original_780/penguin-dindim.PNG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Dindim makes his way from Patagonia back to de Souza's beach in Proveta, off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.  (University of Rio de Janeiro)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Souza appears to be the only person who can get near Dindim. If others try, he pecks them or waddles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the penguin believes Joao is part of his family and probably a penguin as well,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/meet-dindim-the-penguin-who-returns-to-his-human-soulmate-every-year-a6917621.html&quot;&gt;biologist Joao Paulo Krajewski said to the Independent.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;When he sees him he wags his tail like a dog and honks with delight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6McB0jhPWqs&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; title=&quot;YouTube content&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krajewski helped report the segment for TV Globo, and said that they caught Dindim on his fifth trip out to see Pereira de Souza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's really impressive, the love the two of them have,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://gshow.globo.com/Bastidores/noticia/2016/03/pinguim-curioso-se-apaixona-por-camera-nos-bastidores-do-domingao-do-faustao-assista.html&quot;&gt;Krajewski said in the segment on the TV Globo show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3487778.1457728486!/fileImage/httpImage/image.PNG_gen/derivatives/original_780/patagonia.PNG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Magellanic penguins breed along the coast of Patagonia. (Wikimedia)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's technically illegal to have a wild animal as a pet in Brazil, as officials want to ensure vulnerable creatures don't get separated from their families and that they can be reintroduced into the wild after injury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent also reported that there's been concern over how climate change could be forcing these penguins farther north into the warmer Brazilian waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that Dindim is going all the way back to his home territory in Patagonia, since he spends the time he'd usually be breeding and moulting with Pereira de Souza, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/joaopaulo.krajewski/posts/1008600529225514&quot;&gt;Krajewski said in a Facebook post.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes that Dindim now interprets Proveta as his home, and imprinted on the 71-year-old, whom Dindim sees as a partner. For reasons like these, most professionals try to avoid this circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This isolated case in Brazil certainly allowed Dindim to live and was the best this humble and kind man could do for the penguin,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/joaopaulo.krajewski/posts/1008600529225514&quot;&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love the penguin like it's my own child,&quot; said Pereira de Souza to Globo TV. &quot;And I believe the penguin loves me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Top PDFs Posted to Hacker News in 2018</title>
<link>https://getpolarized.io/2019/01/08/top-pdfs-of-2018-hackernews.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://getpolarized.io/2019/01/08/top-pdfs-of-2018-hackernews.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/openbook.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacker News is a GREAT source of tech news but one of the things I really like about it is when insanely smart people post actual PDFs they've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I've seen PDFs from text books, brilliant original research and even old trusted technical books from the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured it would be interesting to compute the top PDFs from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastreamer.io/&quot;&gt;Datastreamer&lt;/a&gt; (my company when not working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;) we have nearly a petabyte of web data to play with. We provide data indexing services for companies &lt;strong&gt;serious&lt;/strong&gt; indexing web data (think search engines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out we have 12 copies of Hacker News for every day of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it's calculated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I threw some code together to quickly parse out the top links. I actually thought they would be helpful for users of Polar so I decided to share with class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is computed by taking any link to a PDF file that was on the front page at least once in a 24 hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The List!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here's the full list of the top PDFs from Hacker News in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you need a tool to manage your PDFs which supports annotation and highlighting you should really take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;. It's Open Source, cross platform, and designed for people passionate about reading, education, and research.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Despite promises, cell carriers are still selling your real-time location data</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/us-cell-carriers-still-selling-your-location-data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/us-cell-carriers-still-selling-your-location-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Last year, four of the largest U.S. cell carriers were caught selling and sending real-time location data of their customers to shady companies that sold it on to big spenders, who would use the data to track anyone “within seconds” for whatever reason they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, little-known company &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/loc-aid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;loc-aid&quot;&gt;LocationSmart&lt;/a&gt; was obtaining (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/locationsmart-didnt-just-sell-mobile-phone-locations-it-leaked-them/&quot;&gt;and leaking&lt;/a&gt;) real-time location data from AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint and selling access through another company, 3Cinteractive, to Securus, a prison technology company, which tracked phone owners without asking for their permission. This game of telephone with people’s private information was discovered, and the cell carriers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cell-carriers-selling-access-to-real-time-location-data/&quot;&gt;facing heavy rebuke&lt;/a&gt; from Sen. Ron Wyden, a privacy-minded lawmaker, buckled under the public pressure and said they’d stop selling and sharing customers’ locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would’ve been that — until it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot;&gt;new reporting by Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; shows that while LocationSmart faced the brunt of the criticism, few focused on the other big player in the location-tracking business, Zumigo. A payment of $300 and a phone number was enough for a bounty hunter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot;&gt;track down the participating reporter&lt;/a&gt; by obtaining his location using Zumigo’s location data, which was continuing to pay for access from most of the carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/zumigo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;zumigo&quot;&gt;Zumigo&lt;/a&gt; sold that data on — like LocationSmart did with Securus — to other companies, like Microbilt, a Georgia-based credit reporting company, which in turn sells that data on to other firms that want that data. In this case, it was a bail bond company, whose bounty hunter was paid by Motherboard to track down the reporter — with his permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seemed to drop the ball. Microbilt said the bounty hunter shouldn’t have used the location data to track the Motherboard reporter. Zumigo said it didn’t mind location data ending up in the hands of the bounty hunter, but still cut Microbilt’s access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nobody quite dropped the ball like the carriers, which said they would not to share location data again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/t-mobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;t-mobile&quot;&gt;T-Mobile,&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the latest location-selling revelations for passing the reporter’s location to the bounty hunter, said last year in the midst of the Securus scandal that it “reviewed” its real-time location data sharing program and found appropriate controls in place. To appease even the skeptical, T-Mobile chief executive John Legere &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1009168217586061313&quot;&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt; that he “personally evaluated the issue” and promised that the company “will not sell customer location data to shady middlemen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see how that isn’t, in hindsight, a downright lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;7.2167182662539&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;8.8204334365325&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sounds like word hasn’t gotten to you, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RonWyden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ronwyden&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve personally evaluated this issue &amp;amp; have pledged that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@tmobile&lt;/a&gt; will not sell customer location data to shady middlemen. Your consumer advocacy is admirable &amp;amp; we remain committed to consumer privacy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UPx3Xjhwog&quot;&gt;https://t.co/UPx3Xjhwog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/john-legere&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;john-legere&quot;&gt;John Legere&lt;/a&gt; (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1009168217586061313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, T-Mobile said it “does not have a direct relationship” with Microbilt but admitted one with Zumigo, which, given the story and the similarities to last year’s Securus scandal, could be considered one of many “shady middlemen” still obtaining location data from cell carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legere later &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1082824623740248065&quot;&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; late Wednesday that the company “is completely ending” its relationships with location aggregators in March, almost a year after the company was first implicated in the first location-sharing scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just T-Mobile. Other carriers were also still selling and sharing their customers’ data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/at&amp;amp;t%20letter%20to%20RW%206.15.pdf&quot;&gt;in last year’s letter&lt;/a&gt; it would “protect customer data” and “shut down” Securus’ access to its real-time store of customer location data. Most saw that as a swift move to prevent third-parties accessing customer location data. Now, AT&amp;amp;T seemed to renege on that year-ago pledge, saying it will “only permit the sharing of location” in limited cases, including when required by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/sprint-nextel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;sprint-nextel&quot;&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; didn’t say what its relationship was with either Zumigo or Microbilt, but once again — like last year — cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cell-carriers-selling-access-to-real-time-location-data/&quot;&gt;its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; as its catch-all to sell and share customer location data. Yet Sprint, like its fellow carriers AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, which pledged to stop selling location data, clearly didn’t complete its “process of terminating its current contracts with data aggregators to whom we provide location data” as it promised in a letter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon, the parent company of TechCrunch, wasn’t explicitly cleared from sharing location data with third-parties in Motherboard’s report — only that the bounty hunter refused to search for a Verizon number. (We’ve asked Verizon if it wants to clarify its position — so far, we’ve had nothing back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Verizon%20Response%20to%20Sen%20Wyden%2006_15_18.pdf&quot;&gt;a letter sent last year&lt;/a&gt; when the Securus scandal blew up, Verizon said it would “take steps to stop” sharing data with two firms — Zumigo and LocationSmart, an intermediary that passed on obtained location data to Securus. But that doesn’t mean it’s off the hook. It was still sharing location data with anyone who wanted to pay in the first place, putting its customers at risk from hackers, stalkers — or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden. who tweeted about the story, said carriers selling customer location data “is a nightmare for national security and the personal safety of anyone with a phone.” And yet there’s no way to opt out — shy of a legislative fix — given that two-thirds of the U.S. population aren’t going to switch to a carrier that doesn’t sell your location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, you really can’t trust your cell carrier. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many ways to tell the story of Jackie Chan. He is the heir to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the comic grace of his movements leaving audiences in laughing wonder. He’s also the heir to Bruce Lee: If Lee broke old stereotypes about the Asian man being frail and craven, then Chan reinvented him once more, offering across dozens of movies a consistent character who was almost childlike in his cheerfulness, known as much for his winking smile as for the fury of his fists. Before 1995’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rumble in the Bronx&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;made him a household name in America, he was a filmmaker’s filmmaker, his elaborate fight sequences and death-enticing stunts the objects of devoted study by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron. And he helped bring martial arts into the Hollywood mainstream, so that nearly every American action hero, from Jason Bourne to the Black Panther, now boasts elements of karate or jujitsu in their repertoire of ass-kicking skills. The transfer was symbolically completed in 1999’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when Keanu Reeves, having downloaded a fighting program to his brain, opens his eyes and reverently whispers, “I know kung fu.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;recirc-0&quot; class=&quot;recirc-most-popular pull-right pull-small hide&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the Chan legend are all present in his new memoir, &lt;em&gt;Never Grow Up&lt;/em&gt;, as the threads of an unlikely rags-to-riches story. The child of a cook and a maid—a “servant’s kid,” as he was derisively called—he rose from virtually nothing to become the most famous Chinese entertainer on earth. In the book’s introduction, his world-straddling triumph is represented by the lifetime achievement Oscar that he received in 2016, the only time it has ever been bestowed on a Chinese filmmaker. (The book’s jacket features him holding the golden statue with his eyes closed, as if he is saying a prayer to it.) And like all rags-to-riches stories—whether it’s Daddy Warbucks rescuing little orphan Annie, or an Indian slumdog becoming a millionaire—Chan’s is ultimately a tale about the place where he was born and raised and first made his mark: Hong Kong, which over the course of his lifetime went from being the last significant outpost of the British Empire to an ambiguous outlier of an ascendant China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Grow Up&lt;/em&gt;, in mostly inadvertent ways, thus offers another way of telling Jackie Chan’s story. It’s about colonialism, capitalism, and the myths we construct to justify living under both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chan was born in 1954, Hong Kong was fast becoming a haven for Chinese escaping communist rule on the mainland. This tiny city-state, some 400 square miles in total, had historically served as a foothold for European merchants seeking to gain access to the Chinese market, as the historian Jan Morris recounts in her book &lt;em&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/em&gt;. After Mao and his gang took over in 1949, however, Western trade with China was shut off and Hong Kong became its own focal point, a center for both finance and industry, ultimately transforming into a mighty symbol of capitalism’s wealth-creating power on the very doorstep of the world’s most populous communist nation. As China suffered through famine and political upheaval and one miserable five-year-plan after another, Hong Kong sprouted an endless number of skyscrapers, which seemed to cast long, mocking shadows over its massive neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chan’s parents, fleeing political persecution and seeking work, were among the emigrant laborers who formed the backbone of the Hong Kong economy in the immediate postwar decades. The Chans landed in Victoria Peak, a posh neighborhood high in the hills that is home to the wealthy and foreign diplomats. (It is now best known as a tourist site where one can take in Hong Kong’s famous topography from above, a bristling bowl of concrete and glass poised on the edge of the harbor.) Hong Kong was so important to the Chans that it was embedded in the name they gave their only son: Chan Kong-Sang, which means “born in Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British operated with a light touch in Hong Kong, at least compared to a place like New Delhi, which both administratively and culturally bore the deep imprint of empire. But Chan was nevertheless familiar with the racial dynamics of colonialism. His parents worked at the French consulate, “except we didn’t have a magnificent house that faced the street,” he writes. “Our home was run-down, small, and stuck in the back. The folks at the consulate treated us well, but from the very beginning, we existed in two different worlds.” He became enamored with a girl named Sophie, the “very beautiful” daughter of the French consul, and would stand up to boys who teased her, at one point thrashing the child of a French official. Chan’s father, terrified that he might lose his job, beat the young Chan with a belt, locked him in a shed for hours, then forced him to apologize to the boy and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.newrepublic.com/cd99c6dadecc661a94724a7c152c511034ee81d3.jpeg?w=800&quot; data-serialized=&quot;{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;26dadffe-33af-4c7e-94e8-981c55747b5f&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hash&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;cd99c6dadecc661a94724a7c152c511034ee81d3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1800,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:1033,&amp;quot;format&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;JPEG&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;isAnimated&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;baseUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//images.newrepublic.com/cd99c6dadecc661a94724a7c152c511034ee81d3.jpeg&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;:{}}&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Jackie Chan in “The Legend of Drunken Master,” 1994&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Photofest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impact these experiences had on Chan is hard to discern, since every episode in this memoir, even the most traumatic, is told with Chan’s indefatigable merriness, which as the book goes on starts to feel like a protective mechanism, a carapace of cheer. There is, too, an overarching sense of the phenomenal success that is to come, which casts a backwards glow even on those moments when Chan was at his lowest, cowering by the garbage bags in that lonely shed. Each trial is a stepping stone to the super-stardom that will legitimize everything that came before, rather than an examination of the ways in which being poor and Chinese in a colonial city in the 1950s might have messed a person up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This blind spot is particularly apparent when Chan writes of the crucial formative experience in his life: When he was seven years old, his parents pulled him out of school and enrolled him at the China Drama Academy, which churned out performers for Peking operas and other entertainments. The Chans, who soon after would leave Hong Kong to pursue work in Australia, signed a ten-year contract with the academy, essentially consigning their son to a life of indentured servitude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ten years, Chan trained all day long, from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., with breaks for lunch and dinner. Along with the other boys, he slept on a thin mat, on a carpet encrusted with sweat, spit, and piss. When he misbehaved, he was beaten with canes; when he fell ill, he was told to suck it up and keep practicing his kung fu. He received almost no education, not even in the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and when he first became rich he had trouble signing his own name on credit card receipts. (His memoir is “co-written” with a publicist.) He was, in effect, a walking slab of meat to be trotted out whenever a Peking opera production needed a singer or dancer or acrobat. And when he began seeking work on movie sets in his teens, his master would take a 90 percent cut of his pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan was enmeshed in the vast underclass of the great Hong Kong economy, which to this day is jam-packed with underpaid laborers from around the world who live stacked on top of each other in dismal apartments the size of coffins. And yet the predominant sense in this memoir is that the obvious inequities of the China Drama Academy particularly and Hong Kong more broadly were outweighed by the amazing opportunities they afforded to a nobody like Chan Kong-Sang. He describes those ten years as his “decade of darkness,” but, he adds, “It was in those ten years that I became Jackie Chan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, what to my mind reads like a brutal account of exploitation and abuse is meant to be &lt;em&gt;inspirational&lt;/em&gt;, a testament not only to Chan’s personal fortitude, but also to a certain ethic. Indeed, in Chan’s case, the myth of the self-made man, predicated on hard work and sacrifice, is taken to its extreme, for the thing he willingly sacrifices over and over again, year in and year out, is his body. The China Drama Academy primarily contributed to Chan’s success in three ways: It facilitated lifelong friendships with fellow entertainers, like Sammo Hung, who in the early days got him jobs, then went on to co-star in some of his most famous movies; it prepared him for stuntwork and trained him in martial arts, which were his calling cards in Hong Kong’s down-and-dirty film industry; and it turned his body into an instrument that could withstand ungodly amounts of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his first breaks came when a director demanded a perilous stunt—a tumbling leap from a high balcony—without a wire to catch the stuntman if it went awry. The stunt coordinator refused to let any of his men perform it. Then Chan volunteered, breaking what amounted to an ad hoc labor strike. “What’s the matter with you?” the coordinator asked. “Are you tired of living?” Chan, of course, pulled off the stunt—twice—establishing his reputation as a daredevil. As he started to star in his own films, culminating in his 1978 breakthrough &lt;em&gt;Drunken Master&lt;/em&gt;, original stuntwork became one of his defining traits, alongside his comedic mien. “I always perform my own stunts,” he promises to readers, “no matter how dangerous.” And with that came scores of injuries, which were then showed to audiences after the movie was over, in a highlight reel as the credits rolled. These injuries included a disastrous fall during the filming of &lt;em&gt;Armour of God&lt;/em&gt; (1986) that nearly killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his memoir, Chan proudly recounts the body parts he has shattered over the course of his career: nose, jaw, ankle, cranium. “My leg sometimes gets dislocated when I’m showering,” he writes of the toll his work has taken on him. “I need my assistant to help me click it back in.” This is presented as evidence of his dedication to the craft. It is also what makes him exceptional—not his brilliance or his smile or any other quality, but an almost masochistic willingness to risk his life for the camera. Those highlight reels, full of impossible leaps from the tops of buildings and other brushes with death, became the hallmark of his movies, more memorable than their plots or characters. By the time &lt;em&gt;Rumble in the Bronx&lt;/em&gt; came around in the 1990s, Chan’s antics represented the awesome possibilities of what a human being could do on screen, soon to be surpassed by the hypnotic fireworks of CGI. But read as a Hong Kong success story, it leaves the unfortunate impression that the only way to make it in this town was to literally almost kill yourself with work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/zcuhsEl1rqc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that Chan is unable to evoke in his writing the joyful magic of a Jackie Chan fight scene. The combatants often work in an improbably tight space, with a few props that either shift position or are smashed to pieces, so that the space changes in surprising ways, as if some unexpected dimension of reality is continually unfolding before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a shame, too, that Chan does not say much about his filmmaking style. His Hong Kong, for example, is not that of John Woo (who pioneered the gritty, hardboiled aesthetic of action movies much imitated by Quentin Tarantino) or Wong Kar Wai (all sharp angles and reflections and harsh light, where even the raindrops are lambent with neon). It is something plainer, more straightforward, a bit ugly even: milky-gray sky, drab office interiors, identical white apartment blocks rising from the green hills with the regularity of a picket fence. The principal charm of this aesthetic, like a yellowing photograph, comes from age, dating Hong Kong to a specific moment in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it was at its peak and looking toward the 1997 handover to China with equal measures of hope and trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader is left not with a reminder of Jackie Chan’s genius, but with the rather sad story of his very successful life. It is an old colonial tale, the hapless provincial who becomes worldly, though in Chan’s case he doesn’t evolve beyond being a clownish parvenu. He writes about it with his usual high spirits: “How did it feel to go from being flat broke to being a millionaire, practically overnight? To go from being an uneducated loser to being a famous star? It was fantastic!” He drinks all the time. He totals expensive cars and buys new ones. He spends millions of dollars on fancy watches, chases beautiful women, and licenses a Jackie Chan brand of Australian wines. After he stars in &lt;em&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/em&gt; with Chris Tucker in 1998, he becomes a bona fide star in America, producing a series of comic-action movies in his middle to old age that make him richer and more famous still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He marries and has a child—named Jaycee, after his own initials J.C.—but he hardly ever sees his family because he is constantly working. (He also has a child out of wedlock though this only warrants an offhand sentence.) He is at his most self-aware when discussing his workaholism. “When I was young, people looked down on me,” he writes. “As a young adult, I lived in poverty. When I finally found success, I was driven to give the world one good film after another, to show everyone what I was worth.” He is rich beyond his wildest dreams, but is unable to shed the poor young man he once was, a person desperate for work and afraid of the abyss that could open up at his feet at any moment. His poverty is a wound that never quite heals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those searing experiences have not translated into a sympathetic politics. As Hong Kong was absorbed by China, and as the mainland’s own cities came to rival Hong Kong for wealth and power, it held on to the one trait that truly made it a British colony, which is that it was not a democracy. It would appear that Chan would like to keep it that way, viewing Hong Kong’s democratic movement as a blemish on its reputation for frictionless commerce and order. “Hong Kong has become a city of protest,” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanghaiist.com/2012/12/13/someone_tell_jackie_chan_to_stop_ta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in 2012. “People scold China’s leaders, or anything else they like, and protest against everything.” In 2009 he said, “I don’t know whether it is better to have freedom or to have no freedom. With too much freedom, it can get very chaotic. It could end up like in Taiwan.” He added, “Chinese people need to be controlled, otherwise they will do whatever they want.” Indeed, China’s authoritarian-capitalist model, with its billion-plus consumers looking to spend time at the movies, suits Chan very well. He has moved his base of operations to Beijing and become a kind of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinafile.com/jackie-chan-young-master-comes-age&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;soft-power ambassador&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the Communist Party.

&lt;p&gt;If Chan once represented what a Hong Konger could do with a little pluck and a little luck, his relentlessly buoyant memoir offers a different message: Life is hard, so one must be harder. It is an ethos that perhaps has been there all along. &lt;em&gt;Police Story&lt;/em&gt; (1985), one of his best movies, concludes with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ2Z8pGWmmg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;epic fight scene&lt;/a&gt; in a mega department store, that ubiquitous symbol of Hong Kong’s consumer economy. Against a backdrop of designer clothes and jewelry and electronics, Chan fights a whole gang of bad guys, sending them flying into mannequins and tumbling down escalators. There is shattered glass everywhere as bodies slam through display cases and storefronts. At one point, inexplicably, a motorcycle makes an appearance, careening through more panes of glass. When it looks like the head of the gang is about to get away, Chan leaps from the store’s top story onto a giant pole festooned with lights, sliding all the way down in a shower of electric sparks. (In his memoir he reveals he shouted the words “I die!” as he jumped.) He crashes into more glass at the bottom, and in one unbroken motion gets up and keeps fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains a breathtaking scene, combining everything audiences have come to love about Jackie Chan: athleticism, derring-do, an everyman’s goodness. But there is something disturbing about it, too, the way Chan is both destroying and being destroyed by this mall. There is blood on his face, after all. And the blood is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Disruption for Thee, But Not for Me</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://locusmag.com/2019/01/cory-doctorow-disruption-for-thee-but-not-for-me/</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-69156&quot; src=&quot;http://locusmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cory2009_200x268.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cory Doctorow&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;268&quot;/&gt;Photo by Paula Mariel Salischiker
&lt;p&gt;The Silicon Valley gospel of “disruption” has descended into caricature, but, at its core, there are some sound tactics buried beneath the self-serving bullshit. A lot of our systems and institutions are corrupt, bloated, and infested with cream-skimming rentiers who add nothing and take so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take taxis: there is nothing good about the idea that cab drivers and cab passengers meet each other by random chance, with the drivers aimlessly circling traffic-clogged roads while passengers brave the curb lane to frantically wave at them. Add to that the toxic practice of licensing cabs by creating “taxi medallions” that allow businesspeople (like erstwhile Trump bagman Michael Cohen) to corner the market on these licenses and lease them to drivers, creaming off the bulk of the profits in the process, leaving drivers with barely enough to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So enter Uber, an app that allows drivers and passengers to find each other &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; efficiently, that gives drivers realtime intelligence about places where fares are going begging, and which bankrupts the rent-seeking medallion speculators almost overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Uber &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; eliminates safety checks for drivers (and allows them to illegally discriminate against people with disabilities, people of color, and other marginalized groups); it used predatory pricing (where each ride is subsidized by deep-pocketed, market-cornering execs) to crush potential competitors, and games the regulatory and tax system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber (and its Peter-Thiel-backed rival Lyft) are not good companies. They’re not forces for good. But the system they killed? Also not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the City of Austin played a game of high-stakes chicken with Uber and Lyft. Austin cab drivers have to get fingerprinted as part of a criminal records check, and Austin wanted Uber and Lyft drivers to go through the same process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft &lt;em&gt;violently&lt;/em&gt; objected to this. They said it would add a needless barrier to entry that would depress the supply of drivers, and privately, they confessed their fear that giving in to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; regulation, &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, would open the door to regulation everywhere. They wanted to establish a reputation for being such dirty fighters that no city would even try to put rules on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Notably, Uber and Lyft did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make any arguments about criminal background checks perpetuating America’s racially unjust “justice system” in which people of color are systematically overpoliced and then railroaded into guilty pleas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin wasn’t intimidated. They enacted the rule, and Uber and Lyft simply exited the city, leaving Austin without any rideshare at all. All the drivers and passengers who’d come to rely on Lyft and Uber were out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the drivers were undaunted. They formed a co-operative and in months, they had cloned the Uber app and launched a new business called Ride Austin, which is &lt;em&gt;exactly like Uber&lt;/em&gt;: literally the same drivers, driving the same cars, and charging the same prices. But it’s also completely different from Uber: the drivers own this company through a worker-owned co-op. They take home 25% more per ride than they made when they were driving for Uber. Uber and Lyft drivers commute into Austin from as far away as San Antonio just to drive for Ride. That’s how much better driving for a worker co-op is. &lt;em&gt;[Edit: RideAustin reached out to us to correct this information. RideAustin is not a driver co-op, and was not founded by drivers. Also, RideAustin did not launch “months” after Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin, as the article states. RideAustin was founded within a week after the big guys left, and began rides less than a month later (first ride was on June 16, 2016). More information can be found at their site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rideaustin.com/faq/&quot;&gt;RideAustin.com&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when the term “platform cooperativism” was first bandied about to describe this kind of thing. I was at a small, invitational tech conference where nerds, investors, activists, lawyers, SF writers and other technologically oriented types were gathered. I was on a panel about these platform co-ops and I said that I thought Uber would be really easy to replace with a co-op: the riders and the drivers valued the service, not the logo on the app, and plenty of people were happy about the convenience of Uber but unhappy about the creepy, rapacious nature of the company behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor in the audience stood up to tell me how full of shit I was: I had no idea just how complicated Uber’s app and infrastructure were, and there was no way a bunch of grubby drivers would ever be able to match its expert coding and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s another, better argument against this kind of platform cooperativism: “discovery costs.” I first hailed a Ride car at South By Southwest, not long after Lyft and Uber had exited the city, and everyone going to the festival had been repeatedly warned that they would have to download the Ride app to get around the city (Austin’s taxi fleet hasn’t been up to the SXSW crowds for more than a decade, and never less so than now, having been crippled by Uber and Lyft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was prepared. When I land in another city, the first app I try when I need to get around is Lyft, then Uber (Uber was a godsend in Shanghai, where we were repeatedly cheated by regular cab drivers, but where the Uber app kept everything aboveboard). Some or all of these cities might have co-op rideshares, but there’s no easy way to know about it, and without passengers, there’s no incentive for the drivers to drive for the co-ops, so even when you do try to hail a co-op, there won’t be any drivers available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft and Uber have moved back into Austin, and their drivers get fingerprinted. I just got my speaker-info package from SXSW for the 2019 festival, and the advice to download Ride before touching down is no longer the top of the checklist. I imagine that most of the attendees at SXSW will be getting around with Uber and Lyft, and 25% of the money they spend will go to those companies’ shareholders, not to the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But imagine a disruptive app that disrupted the disrupters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if I could install a version of Ride (call it Meta-Uber) that knew about all the driver co-ops in the world. When I landed, I’d page a car with Uber or Lyft, but once a driver accepted the hail, my Meta-Uber app would signal the driver’s phone and ask, “Do you have a driver co-op app on your phone?” If the driver and I both had the co-op app, our apps would cancel the Uber reservation and re-book the trip with Meta-Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way, we could piggyback on the installed base of Uber and Lyft cars, the billions they’ve poured into getting rideshare services legalized in cities around the world, the marketing billions they’ve spent making us all accustomed to the idea of rideshare services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Meta-Uber service would allow for a graceful transition from the shareholder-owned rideshares to worker co-ops. When you needed a car, you’d get one, without having to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of no drivers because there are no passengers because there are no drivers. One fare at a time, we could cannibalize Lyft and Uber into the poorhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billions they’ve spent to establish “first-mover advantages” wouldn’t be unscalable stone walls around their business: they’d be immovable stone weights around their necks. Lyft and Uber would have multi-billion-dollar capital overhangs that their investors would expect to recoup, while the co-ops that nimbly leapt over Uber and Lyft would not have any such burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Technically, this isn’t all that challenging. Create a service where drivers and passengers’ devices all register unique, per-ride codes, have the Meta-Uber check to see if the driver’s device has just posted a unique code that matches yours, and then use the built-in ride-cancelation tool that’s already incorporated into Uber and Lyft to tear down the old reservation and re-create it with Meta-Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; impediments, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the trouble starts. Tech law is a minefield of overly broad, superannuated rules that have been systematically distorted by companies that used “disruption” to batter their way into old industries, but now use these laws to shield themselves from any pressure from upstarts to seek to disrupt &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, passed in 1986 in part to assuage Ronald Reagan’s panic after seeing the movie &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wargames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (I am not making this up). CFAA is nominally an anti-computer-intrusion statute, which criminalizes “exceeding your authorization” on a computer that doesn’t belong to you. Even when it passed, more than 40 years ago, technologically clued-in scholars and practicioners warned that this was way too broadly defined, and that someday we might see this rule used to felonize normal activities involving computers we owned, because the computers would have to talk to a server to accomplish part of their work, and the server’s owner could use onerous “user agreements” and “terms of service” to define our authorization. If this became widespread, then these licenses could take on the force of criminal law, and violating them could become a jailable offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 years later, those fears are vindicated: CFAA is used to threaten, intimidate, sue, and even jail people engaged in otherwise perfectly lawful activity, merely because they have violated some term of service on the way. The metastasis of terms of service into sprawling novellas of impenetrable legalese has created a world where anything you do to frustrate the commercial ambitions of digital monopolists is a potential criminal offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, a Bill Clinton bill that creates a felony for “bypassing an effective means of access control” (AKA Digital Rights Management or DRM) for copyrighted works. Twenty years ago, the proponents for this bill argued that it would be used to safeguard certain marginal commercial technologies: under DMCA 1201, it would be illegal to bypass the region controls on a DVD player, allowing movie studios to force you to buy your DVDs in the same place where you bought the player – it would also allow Sega to force you to buy your Dreamcast games on CDs that came from official Sega pressing plants, rather than direct from the games’ authors, ensuring that Sega would always get a share of the revenues from the sale of games you played on your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, experts warned Congress that DMCA 1201 was way too broad and would be ripe for abuse, as software crept into more systems. Again, the experts were right. Today, DRM is used to force people with artificial pancreases to buy proprietary insulin and people with inkjet printers to buy proprietary ink; it’s used by car manufacturers and phone manufacturers to control who can make parts for their products and who can service them; it’s found in voting machines, tractors, thermostats, virtually every device with software, and it has no connection with copyright enforcement. Rather, it is used for “business model enforcement,” to ensure that disruptive, but legal, ways of using a product or service are made illegal – from refilling your printer’s ink cartridge to getting your car or phone serviced by an independent neighborhood repair shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the CFAA and DMCA have given digital businesses access to a shadowy legal doctrine that was never written by Congress but is nevertheless routinely enforced by the courts: &lt;em&gt;Felony Contempt of Business-Model&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFAA and DMCA 1201 have been carefully distorted into defensive, anti-disruption shields that are only available to digital businesses. Taxi medallion owners can’t use the CFAA and DMCA 1201 to keep Uber and Lyft out of their cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Uber and Lyft could use these legal tools to keep Meta-Uber out of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; bottom lines. Uber and Lyft have lengthy terms-of-service that set out the rules under which you are authorized to communicate with Uber and Lyft’s servers. These terms of service prohibit using their servers to locate drivers for any purpose other than booking a ride. They certainly don’t permit you to locate a driver and then cancel the booking and re-book with a co-op app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Uber and Lyft’s apps are encrypted on your phone, so to reverse-engineer them, you’d have to decrypt them (probably by capturing an image of their decrypted code while it was running in a virtual phone simulated on a desktop computer). Decrypting an app without permission is “bypassing an effective means of access control” for a copyrighted work (the app is made up of copyrighted code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft can use DMCA 1201 to stop you from figuring out how to use them to locate co-op drivers, and they can use the CFAA to stop you from flipping your booking from Uber to Meta-Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a hundred other Metas we can imagine: a Meta-Amazon that places your order with the nearest indy bookstore instead; a Meta-OpenTable that redirects your booking to a co-op booking tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single one of these co-ops would disrupt a digital monopolist who came to power preaching the gospel of disruption. Every single one of those digital monopolists would switch to the aggrieved bleats of a bewildered incumbent apex predator snarling and twisted impotently as its flesh was rent by a thousand tiny bites from swarms of fast-moving, highly evolved successors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we never get to bring those lumbering relics down, not so long as felony contempt-of-business-model is still in play in America. Until then, disruption will always be for thee and never for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;Kenya will teach Mandarin in classrooms  in a bid to improve job competitiveness and facilitate better trade and connection with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;The country’s curriculum development institute (KICD) has said the design and scope of the mandarin syllabus have been completed and will be rolled in out in 2020. Primary school pupils from grade four (aged 10) and onwards will be able to take the course, the head of the agency Julius Jwan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2019-01/07/c_137726758.htm&quot;&gt;told Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; news agency. Jwan said the language is being introduced given Mandarin’s growing global rise, and the deepening political and economic connections between Kenya and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;“The place of China in the world economy has also grown to be so strong that Kenya stands to benefit if its citizens can understand Mandarin,” Jwan noted. Kenya follows in the footsteps of &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/africa/477748/south-africas-schools-will-start-teaching-mandarin-and-continue-neglecting-local-languages/&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; which began teaching the language in schools in 2014 and Uganda which is planning &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/africa/1505985/uganda-schools-to-teach-chinese-lessons/&quot;&gt;mandatory Mandarin lessons&lt;/a&gt; for high school students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;Kenya is currently in the midst of rolling out a new educational curriculum to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kicd.ac.ke/press_releases/curriculum-reform-agenda-has-not-been-shelved-kicd-october-7-2018/&quot;&gt;improve educational quality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/thesauce/kenyas-education-system-on-a-journey-to-a-new-competence-based-curriculum/&quot;&gt;focus on skills&lt;/a&gt; that would make graduates more employable in the labor market. Just last year, education officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nation.co.ke/news/education/Government-launches-new-roadmap-for-proposed-curriculum/2643604-4250430-1t9j41z/index.html&quot;&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; the roadmap for the first pilot of the new curricula for students in pre-school and standards one and two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;Then education secretary Fred Matiang’i said the syllabus would be tested in order to see what to improve before they are fully implemented across all primary and secondary classes. Mandarin is set to be taught alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/12/25/new-2-6-3-3-3-curriculum-how-different-is-it-from-the-8-4-4-system_c1689364&quot;&gt;local languages&lt;/a&gt; besides other foreign ones including French and Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;As officials in Nairobi deliberated introducing the language in schools, they received support from Beijing over the past few years. A delegation of Chinese scholars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nation.co.ke/news/china-planning-Mandarin-examinable-subject-kenyan-schools/1056-3458324-14c2ue8z/index.html&quot;&gt;helped with developing&lt;/a&gt; the courses, while scholarships were doled out to Kenyan graduate students to study in Chinese universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe africa&quot;&gt;The beneficence is strategic for China, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/africa/1324618/china-is-kenyas-largest-creditor-with-72-of-total-bilateral-debt/&quot;&gt;lent billions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars to Kenya, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/africa/996255/kenyas-3-2-billion-nairobi-mombasa-rail-line-opens-with-help-from-china/&quot;&gt;built a railway&lt;/a&gt; between its two major cities, held &lt;a href=&quot;https://africa.cgtn.com/2018/03/03/kenyas-first-chinese-spring-festival-gala-kicks-off-in-nairobi/&quot;&gt;major cultural festivals&lt;/a&gt; in the east African state, and whose companies are involved in constructing everything from highways to apartments. Long before their &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/africa/1351749/chinas-confucius-institutes-in-africa-spread-mandarin-culture/&quot;&gt;prevalence across Africa&lt;/a&gt;, China set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://confucius.uonbi.ac.ke/node/3&quot;&gt;Africa’s first Confucius Institute&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Nairobi.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
