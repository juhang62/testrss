<title>Lambda School (YC S17) now pays eligible students $2k/month</title>
<link>https://lambdaschool.com/stipend</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lambdaschool.com/stipend</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;What is the Lambda Living Stipend Pilot Program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambda School will be offering both current and prospective students the opportunity to apply for a total of 18K USD in financing to support their living expenses while they are enrolled as full time Lambda School students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is Lambda School trying to launch this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal at Lambda School is to help our students really succeed to the best of their ability and to remove the barriers that are currently preventing more people from being able to access a high tech education - and the career, financial, impact and other benefits that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that one of the hardest parts of deciding to go back to school is figuring out how to make it work without a full time salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By launching this Living Stipend Pilot Program, we are looking at how we can create more products and innovative ways to help support our current students - and to expand who can become a Lambda School student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How will it operate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who are selected will receive 18K USD paid in nine monthly payments of $2000 USD for the duration of the full time nine month program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue to receive the stipend students have to maintain full time status and the 100% sprint pass rate expected from all Lambda School students - regardless of whether they are receiving a living stipend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who can apply for the stipend?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This program is open to current and prospective full-time Lambda School students who are living in and authorized to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do students then pay back the money?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a stipend and not a scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of the nine month program students will be required to pay 10% of their salary for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But how does this work with my education ISA?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lambda School tuition Income Share Agreement has students on a repayment plan of 17% for two years with a payment cap of $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students who receive the living stipend as well, this becomes 10% of their salary for five years and replaces the model above. The payment cap is also increased to $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the selection criteria?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be looking at student financials or credit scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the applications will be screened using the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you need this living stipend to be successful as a Lambda School student?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell us a bit about the unique part of your story that will make you a valuable addition to both the Lambda and tech community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give examples of your grit and leadership qualities that show you can grow and thrive in this new job field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who will be selecting the recipients?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current Lambda School admissions team will be handling these stipend applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How many students will receive the stipend?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a limited and selective pilot program and to launch we will be looking for our first 50 recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do recipients have to account for how they spend the money?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will Lambda School be expanding this program, when?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, stay tuned for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still have a question, please contact co&lt;a href=&quot;https://lambdaschool.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d1bfa5b0b2a591bdb0bcb3b5b0a2b2b9bebebdffb2bebc&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boeing 737 Max pilots complained to feds for months about suspected safety flaw</title>
<link>https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2019/03/12/boeing-737-max-8-pilots-complained-feds-months-suspected-safety-flaw</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2019/03/12/boeing-737-max-8-pilots-complained-feds-months-suspected-safety-flaw</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines told &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; that it hasn't received any reports of issues with MCAS from its pilots, &quot;nor do any of our thousands of data points from the aircraft indicate any issues with MCAS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Airlines emailed a statement to &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; Tuesday night saying that it believes the Max 8 planes are safe, that its pilots are well-trained to fly them, and that the Fort Worth-based company has not &quot;had similar issues regarding an erroneous angle of attack during manual flight.&quot;&lt;i/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAA issued a statement to &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; on Tuesday saying it was &quot;collecting data and keeping in contact with international civil aviation authorities as information becomes available.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The FAA continuously assesses and oversees the safety performance of U.S. commercial aircraft,&quot; the statement said. &quot;If we identify an issue that affects safety, the FAA will take immediate and appropriate action.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a news release Monday night: &quot;We fully support Southwest Airlines' decision to continue flying the MAX and the FAA's findings to date.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing, which posted a record $101 billion in revenue last year, issued a new statement Tuesday saying that no grounding of planes was necessary. &quot;Based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,&quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuelsen, of the transport workers union, said it's &quot;unconscionable&quot; that the FAA has not yet grounded the planes in the U.S., given the number of deaths that have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This pressure should not be on these pilots to overcome an engineering flaw that Boeing themselves acknowledges,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I check whether my flight is on a 737 Max?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have a ticket, you should be able to tell from the booking details. If you are making a booking online, many sites indicate the model. If not, websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://flightstats.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://flightstats.com&lt;/a&gt; allow you to dig into details of flights at least a few days in advance, including the make and type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;        </description>

<title>Google’s new voice recognition system works instantly and offline (Pixel only)</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/googles-new-voice-recognition-system-works-instantly-and-offline-if-you-have-a-pixel/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/googles-new-voice-recognition-system-works-instantly-and-offline-if-you-have-a-pixel/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Voice recognition is a standard part of the smartphone package these days, and a corresponding part is the delay while you wait for Siri, Alexa or &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to return your query, either correctly interpreted or horribly mangled. Google’s latest speech recognition &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/an-all-neural-on-device-speech.html&quot;&gt;works entirely offline&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating that delay altogether — though of course mangling is still an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay occurs because your voice, or some data derived from it anyway, has to travel from your phone to the servers of whoever operates the service, where it is analyzed and sent back a short time later. This can take anywhere from a handful of milliseconds to multiple entire seconds (what a nightmare!), or longer if your packets get lost in the ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not just do the voice recognition on the device? There’s nothing these companies would like more, but turning voice into text on the order of milliseconds takes quite a bit of computing power. It’s not just about hearing a sound and writing a word — understanding what someone is saying word by word involves a whole lot of context about language and intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your phone could do it, for sure, but it wouldn’t be much faster than sending it off to the cloud, and it would eat up your battery. But steady advancements in the field have made it plausible to do so, and Google’s latest product makes it available to anyone with a Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/on-device-light-blue-background.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796264&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/on-device-light-blue-background.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google’s work on the topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06621&quot;&gt;documented in a paper here&lt;/a&gt;, built on previous advances to create a model small and efficient enough to fit on a phone (it’s 80 megabytes, if you’re curious), but capable of hearing and transcribing speech as you say it. No need to wait until you’ve finished a sentence to think whether you meant “their” or “there” — it figures it out on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the catch? Well, it only works in Gboard, Google’s keyboard app, and it only works on Pixels, and it only works in American English. So in a way this is just kind of a stress test for the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the trends in the industry, with the convergence of specialized hardware and algorithmic improvements, we are hopeful that the techniques presented here can soon be adopted in more languages and across broader domains of application,” writes Google, as if it is the trends that need to do the hard work of localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making speech recognition more responsive, and to have it work offline, is a nice development. But it’s sort of funny considering hardly any of Google’s other products work offline. Are you going to dictate into a shared document while you’re offline? Write an email? Ask for a conversion between liters and cups? You’re going to need a connection for that! Of course this will also be better on slow and spotty connections, but you have to admit it’s a little ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Graying Out</title>
<link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Lights-Going-Out</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Lights-Going-Out</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;For many years I’ve interacted with my fellow humans, I think perhaps more than any other way, via the medium of Internet chat. But in my chat window, they’re fading, one by one. This problem is technical and personal and I felt it ought not to go unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;inline&quot; alt=&quot;Adiumy&quot; title=&quot;Adiumy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Adiumy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since forever I’ve used a chat client called &lt;a href=&quot;https://adium.im/&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt;; it’s open-source, has a good, polished, flexible UX, and is self-updating. The people I talked to, some of them were on AIM, ICQ, on various flavors of Jabber and XMPP and then, in latter years, Google+. What’s happening is, they’re going away. The chat connections I mean, although many of those underlying services are winking out too, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That’s the Adium mascot, “Adiumy”, on the right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those to whom those terms “Jabber” and “XMPP” are new, they represented the idea that any chat service should be able to talk to any other chat service, so you could use whichever you liked best, and hang with your friends wherever on the Net they hung their chatty hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when commercial chat services supported XMPP because it was felt to be the right thing to do. But that was old-school hippie thinking, because if chatterers can just go ahead and talk to anyone anywhere, then &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; service probably won’t go viral and how are you going to monetize? You can simultaneously think markets are a useful civic tool and recognize obvious, egregious failures. So the links were severed and a whole lot of services just died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, my Adium typically listed literally hundreds of people I might choose to talk with, with a red or green “available” glyph; they were grayed-out of they weren’t signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, more and more are always grayed out, because they were on some other service that’s no longer connected. It makes me sad, because I can no longer say “Hey, qq?” when I want to. So I thought I’d cut and paste some of those people. The world being what it is, chances are there are lots that I’ll never chat with again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to tour through maybe 1% of the names in my chat window, for its own sake and to say I haven’t forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of the Adium window just now, only two people currently showing logged-in and available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Green.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Phipps and Sharpe&quot; title=&quot;Phipps and Sharpe&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Green.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshedinsights.com/&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, long time open-source maven, is an important figure in my life. In 2004, when I ejected from a failing startup and was wondering what to do, Simon reached out and said “How about coming to work for Sun? You’re interesting because you’re a blogger.” I haven’t the vaguest how my life would have turned out if he hadn’t. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucesharpe/?originalSubdomain=ca&quot;&gt;Bruce’s&lt;/a&gt; life and mine have run roughly parallel since 1973 or so; we were students at the University of Guelph; I was a little ahead and marked his papers. Then he got mixed up in technology and markup and eventually XML and hired my wife, and now we hang out together a bit in the Vancouver Electric Vehicle Association. Life is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s move into the territory of people who are still signed on, but not in chat mode. On current trends, they’ll be graying out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red1.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nottingham, O’Grady, Yugui&quot; title=&quot;Nottingham, O’Grady, Yugui&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mnot.net/&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; is a pillar of the net, has done as much as any other human to keep HTTP’s design and specification coherent over the last couple of decades. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sogrady.org/&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; is an analyst with a baseball cap, and knows really a lot about the Internet biz. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.yugui.jp/about&quot;&gt;Yugui&lt;/a&gt; I hardly know&lt;span class=&quot;dashes&quot;&gt; —&lt;/span&gt;  for a long time she was the Ruby release manager, and has her fingerprints all over the language’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red2.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gregorio, Hardt, Rohit, Markes, Meier, Mueller&quot; title=&quot;Gregorio, Hardt, Rohit, Markes, Meier, Mueller&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitworking.org/&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; is a technologist and evangelist. Dick was a long-time pillar of the Vancouver tech scene, I worked for him as a consultant once and dueled with him over hiring talent on others, now he’s a fellow Amazonian. Rohit is one of the most social humans on the planet and at one point the FoRK (Friends of) list was a force to be reckoned with in the Valley. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/07/RohitSmruti&quot;&gt;went to his wedding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kevinmarks.com/&quot;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; has fought many standards crusades, most notably microformats; a person who cares deeply about keeping the Net working. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.radioactiveyak.com/&quot;&gt;Reto&lt;/a&gt; preceded me on the Android DevRel team at Google, and taught me a whole lot about advocacy, how to do it with integrity and sanity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pythondj&quot;&gt;Diane&lt;/a&gt;, whom I’ve known along multiple axes, lives in a nice part of the world and wears a red hat these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red3.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cooper, Enebo&quot; title=&quot;Cooper, Enebo&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danese_Cooper&quot;&gt;Danese&lt;/a&gt;, she was doing Internet advocacy almost before there was an Internet. As a Microsoftie, she had to file a special ticket to get a specialized team to get her set up so she could get real Internet Mail, and nobody else there could understand why anybody would want such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.enebo.com/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; is a Rubyist, we hired him and Charles Nutter at Sun in the mid-two-thousands. He takes good pictures too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re moving into the grayed-out territory, and I’ll take a quick tour through the alphabet; I manage to hit almost every letter. You might recognize some of the names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/A.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aitken&quot; title=&quot;Aitken&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was close to my ex-wife decades ago, then a development manager at the University of Waterloo; I liked her a lot but we’ve kind of lost touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/B.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Berners-Lee&quot; title=&quot;Berners-Lee&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/B.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard of this guy. Back in my W3C days, we drank like Churchill; not heavily but steadily. Tim’s always been on the right side of the important issues. He and I (and Jobs and Gates) were all born in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/C.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cantrill&quot; title=&quot;Cantrill&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/C.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me a whole lot about how the people who build kernels and filesystems think about them. He’s exhibited a regrettable tendency to JavaScript at certain times, but builds wonderful things. I think we’re competitors now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/D.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DiBona&quot; title=&quot;DiBona&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/D.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris sat for many years at the heart of Google’s culture and was a voice for sanity in a place that needed a whole lot more of it. Maybe he still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/E.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enns-Bray&quot; title=&quot;Enns-Bray&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/E.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nephew! Got his Ph.D. at ETH in Zürich in some scary combination of medicine and technology and is now making a living with it, still in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/F.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Faulkner, Ferraioli&quot; title=&quot;Faulkner, Ferraioli&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/F.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally’s a dear friend, does hospitality in Melbourne, we see her every other year, more or less. Julia’s been in Google DevRel, exhibiting courage and grace while she’s fought an endless struggle with the kind of health issue that renders the medical profession alternately helpless and counterproductive; I admire her immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/G.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gilbane&quot; title=&quot;Gilbane&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/G.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Frank was maybe the single most influential person in the world of publishing technology. I think he’s still working on it. I was briefly editor of &lt;cite&gt;The Gilbane Report&lt;/cite&gt;; I still remember a huge lifesaving lunch he bought me when a series of travel/schedule breakages meant that I’d not managed a square meal in two successive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/H.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hackborn, Hanley&quot; title=&quot;Hackborn, Hanley&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/H.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne is maybe the most accomplished software engineer the world has never heard of, buried in the bowels of Google. She was super helpful when I was trying to figure out how to be a voice for Android at Google. Dervala is a lovely person whose writing I worship, even though she only blogs annually these days. Stop what you’re doing and go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://dervala.com/&quot;&gt;The Wishing Chair, 2018&lt;/a&gt;; you’ll thank me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Hoffman.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hoffman&quot; title=&quot;Hoffman&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Hoffman.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one frosts my socks; I’ve worked with Paul quite a bit and like him a lot and our chat linkage is irremediably broken behind some fucking XMPP SNAFU that I’m not smart enough to figure out and fix. He helps build the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/J.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Janssen&quot; title=&quot;Janssen&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/J.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen invented the various Devoxx-related conferences and has done a fine job, contributing to the structure of the software commmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/K.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kilmer, Kimber&quot; title=&quot;Kilmer, Kimber&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/K.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich is yet another Rubyist, lots of them in this episode; I miss being part of the Ruby family, it’s a fine place. Eliot was one of the original XML posse; we disagreed about almost every issue in the design of XML, but I never doubted his integrity or intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/L.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Leung&quot; title=&quot;Leung&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/L.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hired Ted at Sun as another smart tech blogger; we also have photography in common. I got to know him and his family pretty well in the first blog-centric social-media surge, and thought a lot of them; I hope that family is still intact and hanging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/M.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mansfield&quot; title=&quot;Mansfield&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/M.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another long parallel path. Phil was one of the inventors of SVG so I first met him in a standards context. Then our sons were on the same soccer teams (they still hang out sometimes) and our families became friends. But geography has intervened and we hardly see them any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/N.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nicol&quot; title=&quot;Nicol&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/N.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavin was doing magic with XML before there was XML. An eclectic and determined guy, I miss him. LinkedIn suggests he’s still in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/O.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;O’Reilly&quot; title=&quot;O’Reilly&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/O.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another name you might recognize; deserves credit for some of the nicer flavors you find in geek culture. The second O in “FOO” stands for O’Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/P.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pilgrim&quot; title=&quot;Pilgrim&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/P.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Mark was maybe the most interesting person on the Internet. He disconnected with a bang, which decreased the value of the Net but may have saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Q.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Qhin&quot; title=&quot;Qhin&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Q.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Barefoot Programmer” and that’s not just figurative, I’ve seen him shoeless in situations that most reasonable people would consider unreasonable. Always on the right side of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/R.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ridley&quot; title=&quot;Ridley&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/R.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly know Michael but we hung out a bit when he was head librarian at the University of Guelph and I was re-acquainting myself with the place; he never failed to charm me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/S.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Schonbrun, Schwartz, Scoble&quot; title=&quot;Schonbrun, Schwartz, Scoble&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/S.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill and I gave it our best shot at a startup but didn’t quite make it. I went to his wedding and miss him, although last time we spoke, he had the misfortune of being an Oracle employee. Randal Schwartz is a geek’s geek, just type his name into any search engine and prepare to be entertained. We’ve been on a cruise ship together, twice! And then there’s the Scobleizer, perhaps the canonical example of a life lived online. You can’t imagine what it was like in 2004-2005 when he was Microsoft’s Blogger and I was Sun’s and every word we wrote mattered. And did we ever write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/T.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Thomas&quot; title=&quot;Thomas&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/T.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course PragDave; I don’t know anybody in the world more accomplished at writing about software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/U.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Udell&quot; title=&quot;Udell&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/U.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon, another master of the life online, has spotted a whole lot of technology trends before anyone; it’s never wrong to read what he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/W.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Waite, Wardley, Weinberger&quot; title=&quot;Waite, Wardley, Weinberger&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/W.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandy is special to me because she represents the first time, as a member of a Google hiring committee, that I got to be part of hiring a Googler. Great fun online, and you just can’t get any more eclectic. Simon’s presence online is massive and he seems to be right about everything even if I never quite grasped his mapping method. David and I go back to 1990 or so, and he taught me how best to use stories in a business context; this blog certainly wouldn’t exist without his influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Y.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yamazaki&quot; title=&quot;Yamazaki&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Y.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fumi is a delightful person, the very model of a modern advocate, bridging the Pacific between Tokyo and Mountain View without apparent effort. Never boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Z.png.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zawodny, Zeldman&quot; title=&quot;Zawodny, Zeldman&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Z.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another couple of pioneers of the medium which you are now consuming; Jeremy was blogging &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; before blogging was cool. Jeffrey was designing websites before almost anyone knew what they were; he and I had way too much fun back in the days of the Web Standards Project, saying unspeakable things in public, but they were necessary things too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Not blaming the Net&lt;/span&gt; · The fact that I’ve lost touch with so many of these people isn’t a technology problem, it’s me, me and the times we live in. Among the clear and present dangers to our way of life, once you get past Global Warming and deranged chiefs of state, the atomization of the social fabric is high, high on the list. I haven’t fought hard enough to stay connected (not alone in that). And time grows short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Pressure escalated inside the United States for a grounding of the Boeing 737 Max model that has crashed twice in the past six months. But the Federal Aviation Administration reiterated its position that the plane is considered safe and that it has “no basis to order grounding the aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• The European Union suspended “all flight operations” of the Boeing 737 Max model in question. The action came as more than a half-dozen other countries grounded the plane, and was the most sweeping regulatory action taken so far in the two days since the crash of a Max 8 that killed &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/world/africa/ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash-victims.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;157 people&lt;/a&gt; on a flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• President Trump had a telephone conversation with the chief executive of Boeing, who made the case that the 737 Max 8 should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Mr. Trump also said on Twitter that commercial airplanes had become overly technical, but said nothing about the Boeing Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• At least 34 airlines have now grounded the Max 8, which means roughly two-thirds of the Max 8 planes in operation are now idled. The major outliers are Southwest and American in the United States, and Air Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Boeing stands by the airworthiness of the plane, but said it planned to issue a software update and was working on changes to flight controls and training guidelines following the first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Boeing’s stock price, which fell 5 percent on Monday, fell 6 percent on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Investigators from the United States and elsewhere are at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Much of the investigation will focus on the voice and data recorders recovered on Monday. The airline’s chief executive, interviewed by CNN, said the pilots had told air traffic control they were having “flight control problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-532c3eaa&quot;&gt;E.U. issues comprehensive ban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The European Union’s aviation regulatory agency barred flights of the Max 8, as well as a slightly newer model, the Max 9, joining several other regulators around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The action, which includes all flights over European Union territory, came as India, France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Oman joined China and Indonesia in suspending all use of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The European Union regulator, known as EASA, said the action included the suspension of “all commercial flights performed by third-country operators into, within or out of the E.U.” of the Max 8 and Max 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The decision could disrupt travel not only through the heart of Europe but well beyond, as many commercial flight routes go over European Union territory. Still, the extent of the disruption is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Airlines and passengers will be affected as companies scramble to ensure that passengers can still get to their destinations, but the impact will depend on how much of their fleets are made up of the grounded planes, said Andrew Charlton, the managing director at Aviation Advocacy, an air transport consultancy based in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By Wednesday morning, the groundings spread. Fiji Airways &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fijiairways.com/en-nz/flight-information/travel-alerts/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had grounded all of its Max 8 planes and would try to accommodate passengers using other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday it had banned the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes from its airspace, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.caa.govt.nz/public-and-media-info/caa-releases/boeing-737-max-suspension/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;citing&lt;/a&gt; uncertainty about the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The grounding affected only one airline, Fiji, which had its next New Zealand flight scheduled for Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-1b61ebec&quot;&gt;U.S. and Canadian airlines becoming the outliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Two United States airlines fly the 737 Max 8: Southwest has 34 and American 24. Both have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the planes and found no reason to ground them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t have any changes planned,” Southwest said in a statement. “We have full confidence in the aircraft,” American said. Air Canada, which operates 24 Max 8s, has given no indication it intends to ground them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;American Airlines, however, has faced growing pressure from its flight attendants union to temporarily ground the planes. Lori Bassani, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apfa.org/2019/03/11/3-11-19-press-release-ethiopian-airlines/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; members were calling on the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, to “strongly consider grounding these planes until a thorough investigation can be performed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While she did not say flight attendants would refuse to fly on the Max 8, “our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Adding to the pressure for action in the United States, at least three senators joined the call for grounding the plane. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, called on the F.A.A. to ground the aircraft while the cause of the Ethiopian crash is investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nonetheless the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, said in a statement late Tuesday that based on all available data, there was “no basis” to ground the plane. “Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-2386a1da&quot;&gt;Pilots reported ‘flight control problems,’ airline C.E.O. says&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 reported to air traffic control that they were having “flight control problems” in the moments before the crash, the airline’s chief executive was quoted as saying in an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/boeing-737-max-8-ethiopia-airlines-crash/h_9dee508ccc0a80f533a2bdafb8d5b536&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with CNN.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The quoted remarks from the chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, suggested the plane had not responded to actions by the pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. GebreMariam was also quoted as saying the black boxes recovered from the wreckage “will be sent overseas” and not analyzed in Ethiopia. He did not specify where they would be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-51efe6ff&quot;&gt;Trump speaks to Boeing C.E.O., who urges no grounding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Tuesday morning, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, spoke to President Trump on the phone and argued that the Max should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation. A Boeing official said that during the call with the president, “Dennis reiterated our position that the Max is a safe aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Muilenburg has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, but it has sometimes been an uneasy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-boeing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;assailed Boeing&lt;/a&gt; for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; a month after winning the election. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/business/donald-trump-boeing-lockheed.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club&lt;/a&gt; in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate. Weeks afterward, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help fund President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump also publicly lamented on Tuesday what he described as excessive technology that has overtaken modern commercial jet travel and made it, in his view, more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Without specifying Boeing or the Max 8, Mr. Trump said aircraft had become “far too complex to fly,” and recalled approvingly the era when pilots had total control in the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of postings on Twitter. “All this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Pilots and aviation experts have said repeatedly that flying is now safer than it has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing is negotiating with the Federal Aviation Administration over improvements to its 737 Max 8 after the aircraft’s second crash in five months, though both the government and company insist the plane is safe to fly as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since October, when a Max 8 belonging to the budget airline Lion Air crashed in Indonesia soon after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board, Boeing has been working on changes to the flight control systems of the aircraft. The company has also been updating its training guidelines and manuals so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

The main changes now being developed to those systems include limiting how much the plane’s computers can automatically pull down the nose of the plane if sensors detect a stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The concern after the Lion Air crash was that erroneous readings from poorly maintained sensors in the nose of the plane might have fooled the automatic systems into falsely concluding that the plane was traveling sharply upward and in danger of stalling. The automatic systems may then have forced the nose down significantly, sending the plane into a steep dive into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130402&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; late Monday saying that since the Lion Air crash, the company had been developing a “flight control software enhancement for the 737 Max, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.” According to the company, it has been working with the F.A.A. to roll out the software updates across the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-425708af&quot;&gt;Among U.S. victims, a newlywed Ethiopian immigrant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A naturalized newlywed from Ethiopia, a health analyst headed to her first international project, and two brothers on vacation were among at least eight Americans on Flight 302.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The immigrant, Mucaad Hussein Abdalla, 31, a truck driver in St. Cloud, Minn., had just been married in Morocco; his wife, though, was not on the flight, according to Mr. Abdalla’s cousin, Mohamed Warfa. “He loved to play soccer in his free time, and he had many friends in this community,” Mr. Warfa said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Abdalla came to the United States from Ethiopia as a teenager, gained citizenship and supported his mother, brother and sister, who live in Ethiopia, said Mr. Warfa, 29, who created a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/the-siraajmu039aad-memorial-fund?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fb_dn_cpgntopstickysmall_r&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR1TfDCSzm_OtsEGIdTBzSw8Av7Wt42KkL_gFSFoVhdlbmNEYdgMkL6TBXM&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; page to help pay for the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Samya Stumo, 24, of Sheffield, Mass., was a recent graduate of the University of Copenhagen School of Global Health, who had just begun a job at ThinkWell, a nongovernmental organization that promotes access to health care in developing countries. “Samya was in her early 20s and had already done more than I did when I was 34,” her grandmother Laura Nader, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/03/12/woman-who-grew-massachusetts-among-those-killed-ethiopian-plane/2xUSioUdbMt32xaPlQ47hI/story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Boston Globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Melvin Riffel, 30, and Bennett Riffel, 26, were on a vacation that included a stop in Australia. It was intended to be the last escapade before Melvin became a father. His wife, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/support-brittney-and-baby-riffel&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brittney&lt;/a&gt;, is expecting a child in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Melvin worked at the California Department of Transportation. “He was a dedicated civil servant who worked for Caltrans for nearly a decade, and our deepest sympathy and condolences go out to his family, friends and colleagues,” said the Caltrans director, Laurie Berman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Matt Vecere, 43, of Long Beach, Calif., was en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly this week in Nairobi. “Matt was passionate about the environment, civil rights, social and environmental justice, and advocating for those less fortunate,” his mother, Donna Vecere, said in a statement. Mr. Vecere had recently been in Haiti, where he had made several trips after the 2010 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Three generations of one &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/canada/ethiopian-plane-crash-canadian-families.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Canadian family were also onboard the flight&lt;/a&gt; and were among the 18 Canadians killed in the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I am not angry, but I am devastated, I have lost everyone,” said Manant Vaidya, 41, whose parents, sister, brother-in-law and two teenage nieces all died in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-692d965d&quot;&gt;Boeing stock price takes another hit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Share prices of Boeing, a major component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 6.1 percent during trading on Tuesday, following a similar decline Monday on worries about the spreading impact of the Max 8 crash in Ethiopia and the prognosis for future sales of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3bd0a989&quot;&gt;Discovery of black boxes first step to revealing their data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The flight data and cockpit voice recorders of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were recovered on Monday, but the process of extracting the data contained within the so-called black boxes could be lengthy, experts cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers have examined the source code published as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.post.ch/en/business/a-z-of-subjects/industry-solutions/swiss-post-e-voting&quot;&gt;SwissPost e-voting system&lt;/a&gt;, provided by Scytl, and discovered a cryptographic trapdoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If exploited, researchers say this could allow insiders who ran or implemented the election system to modify votes undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Melbourne Vanessa Teague from the School of Computing and Information System conducted the research with Sarah Jamie Lewis from Open Privacy Research Society (Canada) and Olivier Pereria from Université Catholique de Louvain (Belgium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SwissPost system, encrypted electronic votes need to be ‘shuffled’ to protect individual vote privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority who conducts the shuffle is supposed to provide a mathematical proof that no votes have been changed. This allows the election result to be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the trapdoor found in this code allows an authority to produce a proof that seems to verify correctly actually alters votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The existence of a trapdoor is worrying,” Ms Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While nothing in our analysis suggests that this problem was introduced deliberately, its mere presence raises serious questions about the rest of the code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time that researchers have identified serious flaws in internet voting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of other systems in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifca.ai/fc12/pre-proceedings/paper_79.pdf&quot;&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://estoniaevoting.org&quot;&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05646&quot;&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00991&quot;&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; have raised serious concerns about privacy, integrity and verifiability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, our analysis of the code shows errors that are consistent with a naïve implementation of a complex cryptographic protocol by well-intentioned people who lacked a full understanding of its security assumptions,” Associate Professor Teague said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, if someone did want to introduce an opportunity for manipulation, the best method would be one that could be explained away as an accident if it was found. We simply do not see any evidence either way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have shared the finding with SwissPost, who say they have now addressed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Lewis, Professor Pereira and Associate Professor Teague have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vjteague/SwissVote&quot;&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; that explains the technical details of the trapdoor and how an insider could exploit it to undetectably alter election results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vjteague/SwissVote&quot;&gt;Further information&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The Justice Department on Tuesday charged 50 people — including two television stars — with participating in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme that enabled privileged students with lackluster grades to attend prestigious colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The allegations included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/college-admissions-bribery-scheme-affidavit/d216435e-e073-41f6-b6fa-33ed835d053d_note.html?questionId=c2ba5e52-6a22-42ed-a0c9-05c83ee5f83d&amp;amp;utm_term=.c9ada139d5f3&quot;&gt;Read the affidavit: FBI charges 50 in college admissions bribery scheme&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;In Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBI’s Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;The scheme was discovered accidentally by the FBI while working an unrelated undercover operation about a year ago, officials said. That tip led to a sprawling, nationwide corruption probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;“These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,” said Lelling. “This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I’ll add there will not be a separate criminal-justice system, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;No students were charged because prosecutors said their parents were the scheme’s principal actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/college-admissions-bribery-scheme-affidavit/d216435e-e073-41f6-b6fa-33ed835d053d_note.html?questionId=c2ba5e52-6a22-42ed-a0c9-05c83ee5f83d&amp;amp;utm_term=.c9ada139d5f3&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Court filings released Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; paint an ugly picture of privileged parents committing crimes to get their children into selective schools otherwise unlikely to accept them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Among those charged are actresses Felicity Huffman, best known for her role on the television show “Desperate Housewives,” and Lori Loughlin, who appeared on “Full House.” A representative for Loughlin declined to comment. A representative for Huffman did not return messages seeking comment. Huffman appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Others arrested Tuesday include a private-equity executive in Northern California, a senior lawyer at a major law firm in New York and a public relations executive in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said they took part in a criminal conspiracy to bribe test officials and college sports officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;In the wake of the charges, universities began firing or placing on leave some of the accused coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The scheme’s chief architect, William Singer, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday. Officials described Singer as a well-connected college admissions adviser and say he disguised the bribery scheme as a charity, enabling parents to deduct the bribes from their taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Singer was charged with taking about $25 million from 2011 to 2018 — paying some of it to college coaches or standardized-testing officials for their help rigging the admissions process and pocketing the rest, according to the criminal complaint. He allegedly disguised the money using a nonprofit, the Key Worldwide Foundation, which prosecutors described as a slush fund for bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges for racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. He had been cooperating since September. Prosecutors said that a month after he came to the government’s side, Singer alerted several people under investigation about the inquiry — which earned him the obstruction charge. Lawyers for Singer did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Another defendant is Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of the international law firm Willkie Farr &amp;amp; Gallagher. Neither Caplan nor his firm immediately responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Court papers charge that in one secretly recorded conversation, Caplan asked Singer: “If somebody catches this, what happens?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;“The only one who can catch it is if you guys tell somebody,” Singer replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;“I’m not going to tell anybody,” Caplan said, and the two men laughed, according to the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;Two California parents paid Singer in the form of Facebook stock — 2,150 shares worth $251,159 at the time of the bribe in July 2016, according to court papers. Those parents claimed that payment as a charitable donation, the papers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Early in the investigation, the FBI was able to flip Yale’s former women’s soccer coach, who provided evidence against others, officials said. Rudolph Meredith pleaded guilty nearly a year ago, after prosecutors gathered evidence he took a $400,000 bribe to pretend that one prospective student was a recruit, despite the fact that the student in question did not play competitive soccer. The student’s parents paid $1.2 million in bribes, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, sent a letter to the Yale community calling the allegations “an affront to our university’s deeply held values of inclusion and fairness. I want to assure our community,” it says, “that I am committed to making certain the integrity of the admissions and athletic recruitment processes is not undermined again. As the investigation unfolds, the university may take further actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Prosecutors also charged Georgetown’s former head tennis coach, Gordon Ernst. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits — when they were not tennis players of that caliber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;For example, prosecutors alleged, Ernst flagged a California couple’s daughter as a “potential spot,” and her application falsely indicated she had played club tennis through high school and achieved a Top 50 ranking in the U.S. Tennis Association’s junior girls category from her sophomore through her senior years. In fact, she had not played at any Tennis Association tournaments in high school, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;“At her best,” prosecutors wrote, “she appears to have ranked 207th in Northern California in the under-12 girls division, with an overall win/loss record of 2-8.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;In a statement, Georgetown said the school was “deeply disappointed” to learn of the criminal charges against Ernst and said he “has not coached our tennis team since December 2017, following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions. Georgetown cooperated fully with the government’s investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;After leaving Georgetown, Ernst was hired as the University of Rhode Island’s tennis coach. The school said Tuesday he had been placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes so their two daughters would be designated as recruits for the University of Southern California rowing team — even though they were not part of the team. That helped the pair get into USC, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Some of the money was directed to Donna Heinel, a USC athletics official, the complaint alleges. In a statement, USC officials said the school is cooperating with the federal investigation and has launched its own review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Jovan Vavic, the former water polo coach at USC, was charged with taking bribes to pretend students flagged by Singer were recruits for the team. Prosecutors alleged Singer paid private-school tuition payments for Vavic’s children, under the guise of a fabricated scholarship. Vavic did not return an email seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;USC said Tuesday that Heinel and Vavic had been fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;“We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university,” the statement says. “USC is conducting an internal investigation and will take employment actions as appropriate . . . the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Besides fake athletic credentials, the other main thrust of Singer’s schemes involved cheating on college entrance exams. Sometimes that was done by paying a 36-year-old Florida man, Mark Riddell, to take the tests for students. Riddell was so proficient at the exams that he could get a perfect score or calibrate his answers to get very high marks but not a perfect score, the U.S. attorney said. Riddell also agreed to plead guilty in the case and cooperate with investigators, according to officials. Riddell did not immediately return messages, and no attorney was listed for him in court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Other defendants are accused of bribing college entrance exam administrators to facilitate cheating — in some cases, providing students with answers to exams or correcting their answers after they had completed the exams, according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;Prosecutors said a key element of the test-cheating scheme was to make arrangements for the tests to be administered privately over a two-day period, making it easier for Riddell stand in for the students or for a corrupt test administrator to fix the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 — disguised as a charitable donation — to the Key Worldwide Foundation so her oldest daughter could participate in the scam. A confidential informant told investigators that he advised Huffman that he could arrange for a third party to correct her daughter’s answers on the SAT after she took it. She ended up scoring a 1420 — 400 points higher than she had gotten on a PSAT taken a year earlier, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Huffman also contemplated running a similar scam to help her younger daughter but ultimately did not pursue it, the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Other defendants include William McGlashan, a senior executive at a global private-equity firm, TPG Growth, which is a major investor in the ride-hailing service Uber and the music-streaming app Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;A TPG spokesman said that “as a result of the charges of personal misconduct against Bill McGlashan,” he has been placed on “indefinite administrative leave effective immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;According to the criminal charges against McGlashan, he and Singer agreed to trick admissions officials at USC into believing McGlashan’s son was a kicker for a football team — even though his high school didn’t have a football team. Singer offered to edit an image of the child’s head onto a photo of a football kicker, officials alleged. As they discussed it, McGlashan said the situation was “pretty funny,” court documents say. “The way the world works these days is unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot; class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Nick Anderson, Moriah Balingit, Julie Tate, Susan Svrluga and Morgan Smith contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On “Open” Distros, Open Source, and Building a Company</title>
<link>https://www.elastic.co/blog/on-open-distros-open-source-and-building-a-company</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.elastic.co/blog/on-open-distros-open-source-and-building-a-company</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Elastic, our focus is on building great products, forming communities around them, and making our users successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I sat down and wrote the first few lines of Elasticsearch and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; it. I quit my job and spent two years investing in building the product and fostering the amazing community that has been built around it. In 2012 we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search-inc&quot;&gt;formed a company&lt;/a&gt;, Elastic, around it. We have invested in our community of users and embraced the ecosystem of open source products developed around it. We added so many features to Apache Lucene I lost count, making it the strong foundation we all build on top. We have added Kibana, created by Rashid, Logstash created by Jordan, and PacketBeat created by Monica and Tudor, to name a few. We built the products out, fostered the communities around them, and focused on providing the most amount of value to our users. Today, we have hundreds of Elastic developers that work every single day on this vast undertaking. We have hundreds of thousands of community members contributing to our shared success every day. And I am proud of the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code&quot;&gt;we built&lt;/a&gt; to foster it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built a level of trust with our user base that I am proud and humbled by. It starts with being open, and continues with being true to our community and user base in what we do. We also focused on making sure nothing distracts us from that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, ever since we started, we have dealt with FUD. If you build something successful, it is bound to happen. The FUD mostly comes from large(r) companies that fear what such a movement can cause. It is only natural. &quot;Don't use the product, it is a toy.&quot; &quot;It only has a handful of developers, what happens if they get hit by a bus?&quot; &quot;They don't know what &quot;the enterprise&quot; wants.&quot; &quot;They are not true X or Y or Z (insert your word of the day).&quot; We have never let it affect us, or let it occupy our mind. It is done in order to distract us and our community from our main purpose, build great products and communities, that users love. We fail our users if we let it, and we will never fail you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our products were forked, redistributed and rebundled so many times I lost count. It is a sign of success and the reach our products have. From various vendors, to large Chinese entities, to now, Amazon. There was always a &quot;reason&quot;, at times masked with fake altruism or benevolence. None of these have lasted. They were built to serve their own needs, drive confusion, and splinter the community. Our commitment and focus on building great products and communities, that users love, formed our way, and it resonated with you, our users. We built a level of trust with you, an expected rate of innovation, and amazing collaboration, that simply IS, and you saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/about/why-open-source&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, and the power it brings. We also communicated from the start that some features will be commercial, and why. Our honesty, I believe, is a big reason for our shared success. We built our open source code in a way that allows for it to be pluggable and cleanly implemented. We haven't changed our way since we started, building trust with our users for years that we stand by our word, and by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commercial code has been an &quot;inspiration&quot; for others, it has been bluntly copied by various companies, and even found its way back to certain distributions or forks, like the freshly minted Amazon one, sadly, painfully, with critical bugs. We kept on being focused on building great products and communities, that users love. We did not let it distract us, and this focus has paid back tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brand has been used and abused, hijacked, and misrepresented many times. Companies have falsely claimed that they work in collaboration with our company, topically &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Werner/status/649738362086027265&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We did not let it distract us, we kept on building great products and communities, that users love. Dilution of focus is the enemy of a company, and we never let it affect us. It is you that matter, our users, not the noise around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we joined forces with companies, we opened up the code. When we started to see our users use us for APM, we were all excited about it. We joined forces with a pure SaaS company in the APM space called OpBeat, which was a big commercial investment on our end, and open sourced most of it, and made all of it free. It was such a simple decision, since we focus on building great products and communities, that users love, and you, our users, deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When others closed down, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open&quot;&gt;opened up&lt;/a&gt;. We kept our open source code the same, under the same license, and doubled down on being open as a company. We relicensed our existing commercial code under a more permissive license, and opened up the code. Trying to foster the same level of collaboration and transparency we have in our open source code across everything we do. This was done in direct reaction to the many discussions we had with our users, and I am so happy to see it has resonated so much with you. Our level of investment in open source since then has only increased, as has our commitment to more free features and experiences, clearly marked and clearly distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When companies came to us, seeing our success, and asked for special working relationship in order to collaborate on code, demanding preferential treatment that would place them above our users, we told them no. This happened numerous times over the years, and only recently again, this time with Amazon. Some have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/6515&quot;&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; and became wonderful partners to us and the community. Others, sadly, didn't follow through. We have a commitment that we will treat a single developer contributing to our products the same as others. There is no preference, and we will reject any ask to have one. Our answer has always been a constant: send a pull request, like everybody else does. The quality will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write all of this for several reasons. The first, is that we all sometimes need to self reflect on what and why we did that made us successful, to make sure we stay true to our course. With you, our users, our community, our company. Second, to others out there, that face so many reasons to be distracted, keep your focus, and stay true, it is the only thing that matters. And last, to express our shared commitment to continue to build great products and communities, that users love. It is our true north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always Day 0 at Elastic (like the developers we serve, we use zero based numbering). Nothing has changed from the first line of code I wrote to the 10 years of journey we had with all of you, our users, and to the many years to come. I :elasticheart: y'all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On the death of my family&amp;#039;s dairy farm</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This Christmas, like every other, I traveled to northern Wisconsin to stay with my parents on the dairy farm I grew up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I took the opportunity to help my dad and younger brother with barn chores and milk cows. The cows need to be milked twice a day, every day, roughly around 4AM and 4PM. I didn’t help out every shift but I worked more than enough to once again be humbled about the life I left behind and recalibrate my nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 640px, (max-width: 480px) 960px, 1440px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm/early-morning-ca277e6c4b733ac09c1a9d0a21ebc13ca7dfe960058a70c56c2aa17eb29d5722.jpg&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-yid+bEtzOsCcGp0KIevBPKff6WAFinDFbCqhfrKdVyI=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/881eb9-30fe596e1802f43cd7d47284b4087d7dfe2c5fe34449a2e3870cf534517c0d61.jpg 640w, /assets/cb524c-c1eeec15bce481219c11cbf245d773d6477ecff62bd1ffd17c1c7f65d4fb9677.jpg 960w, /assets/0364ba-82fd12daf38caa07567332f783dd98492b19ce20fe9af3f1a4fe98902eb7e310.jpg 1440w&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early morning walk to the barn&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I never had the work ethic to be a farmer. Ever since I was little and playing video games on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System&quot;&gt;NES&lt;/a&gt;, I was enamored by electronics. By the time our family got a personal computer and dial-up internet for Christmas in 1997,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:family-pc&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when I was 11, I was completely and hopelessly sucked in. There followed many evenings where my dad would come flying in to the house to yell at me for being late for chores when I lost track of time on “that damn computer.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:trickery&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully for all involved, my younger brother Noah inherited my dad’s insane work ethic and love of farming and took up the farm’s reins (he also picked up my slack when we were younger - thanks Brother). He loves the work and excels at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barn panorama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instead went to college and became a computer programmer, and haven’t lived in my hometown since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have two older brothers; neither of them got the farming gene either. My eldest brother Jerry&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:jerry-pic&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; lives near Madison and also works in the software field. My second-eldest brother John lives near my folks and helps out quite often, but he also does other work and has other obligations, so most of the daily farming work falls on my youngest brother Noah and my dad, who is now into his seventies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly this year I found out that it will have been my final Christmas coming home and milking cows, because they’ll be selling off the cows over the coming spring and fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end-of-a-long-battle&quot;&gt;The end of a long battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably shouldn’t be a huge shock. Ever since I can remember there has always been a steady drumbeat of family farms going bust. Sometimes the tempo would increase, when milk and/or crop prices would hit new lows, but the drum has always beat on as the industry never seemed to turn a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American milk is a global commodity, with commensurate pricing volatility due to fluctuations in global supply and demand, futures market speculators, and other factors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our family farm was subjected to the same ups and downs as every other farm but had always managed to weather every storm. I recall my dad saying how farming was a series of upturns and downturns in pretty much everything, and how it was important to save money from the good years so you can survive the bad years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cost of production has exceeded the value of production for dairy farms of my family's size since the USDA began collecting these statistics in 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bad times I can remember was in the mid-to-late 90s - I was in elementary school - when milk prices were so low that some farmers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/jan/23/spilled-milk-dairy-farmers-dump-product-to/&quot;&gt;dumping their milk down the drain in protest&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, my mom got involved in dairy activism and became a lead organizer of a group of area farmers who worked together to try to improve their lot and raise public awareness of their struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1995 they met with Wisconsin progressive legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Garvey&quot;&gt;Ed Garvey&lt;/a&gt;, a labor attorney who successfully helped form the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Players_Association&quot;&gt;NFL players’ union&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about forming a union for farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

I think the intent was to provide evidence of grassroots farmer support for Canadian-style controls on milk price and supply, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dairyfarmers.ca/what-we-do/supply-management/myths-realities&quot;&gt;reduce volatility and the need for subsidies&lt;/a&gt; and have managed to maintain Canada’s family farms’ existence, which would give the American federal government ammo to institute similar policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in 1998 they succeeded in establishing their union&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:union&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (technically a guild due to federal labor laws) as a branch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_and_Professional_Employees_International_Union&quot;&gt;OPEIU&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is affiliated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO&quot;&gt;AFL-CIO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while my mom and the other farmers had some success in raising awareness and garnering some attention from various government officials, their efforts didn’t have any discernible effect on policy or the milk price bottom line. Dairy farmers once again had to either hold on tight and ride it out, or go bust (and many did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our family at that time, the milk price situation combined with my dad needing knee surgery (from repeated stress of kneeling on concrete to milk cows) resulted in us having a dispersal sale and selling off most of the herd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember it being an emotional day. After spending a week thoroughly cleaning up the barn and cattle, we set up a fenced-off show area outside the barn where on the day of the auction, the cattle were paraded out one-by-one to display to bidders and the auctioneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk prices being low also lowers the value of milking cows themselves, so we got less money than we had hoped for. To a kid it felt like vultures were paying a pittance to carry away a piece of my identity. By the end of the day, looking down the alleyway at mostly-empty cow stalls bedded with fresh sawdust, that anger turned to sadness and a sense of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, my dad recovered from his surgery, my older brothers graduated from high school and moved out, and as my younger brother and I aged into our early teens, the herd was slowly built up to near-previous levels again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-big-or-get-out&quot;&gt;“Get big or get out”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems hard to believe but at one point it was possible to make a decent living as a dairy farmer with a small herd (what’s now considered small, anyway). In 1981 my dad had a herd of 82 milking cows and he cracked the top 50 in all of northwest Wisconsin’s 22 counties for average milk production. This was in the heart of America’s dairyland by the way, to the point that federal milk pricing used to be based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB880411473424429000&quot;&gt;how many miles away from here you were&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not a scientific poll, it’s an interesting sample. If you look at the herd sizes listed you can see that they’re all what would now be considered small, with only two herds just barely over 100 head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, the farming landscape changed dramatically in the 1970s when &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/article/the-butz-stops-here/&quot;&gt;President Nixon promoted agribusiness lobbyist Earl “Rusty” Butz&lt;/a&gt; to USDA secretary. Butz had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/13/archives/why-they-love-earl-butz-prosperous-farmers-see-him-as-the-greatest.html&quot;&gt;a reputation going back to at least the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; for lobbying for dramatic modernizations to farming at the expense of small farms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=zJs4AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA136&amp;amp;dq=%22Adapt+or+die,+resist+and+perish%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6lPm4t53gAhVE5YMKHft2AdkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Adapt%20or%20die%2C%20resist%20and%20perish%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;“Adapt or die; resist and perish… Agriculture is now big business” he would say&lt;/a&gt;. By the 1970s, before his USDA nomination, he was a director of three large agribusiness corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

Public domain image &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/history/former-secretaries&quot;&gt;courtesy USDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Butz, farming practices were ruled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal&quot;&gt;FDR New Deal&lt;/a&gt;-era controls on production, when memories of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl&quot;&gt;Dust Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and destruction of the land through overproduction were still vivid. These production controls aimed to smooth out volatility by paying farmers to keep fields fallow in times of overproduction, and to release grain from storage in times of shortages. Farming production was geared toward American consumption, but even with the production controls there was always a surplus of grain to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon brought Butz in with a mandate to get rid of the grain surpluses. Butz architected this by selling off the grain surpluses to the Soviets in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/some-deal-the-full-story-of-how-amepnka-got-burned-and-the-russians.html&quot;&gt;“the largest grain deal so far as we [knew] in the history of the world”&lt;/a&gt; in 1972 for hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the deal didn’t come with an upper limit on how much grain the Soviets could buy (“because it did not occur to [them] that the Russians could ever buy too much”), and the Soviets bought up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/07/30/The-great-Soviet-grain-robbery-10-years-later/5162396849600/&quot;&gt;one-fourth of the U.S. wheat harvest that year&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, American supermarket prices for bread and other goods &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/some-deal-the-full-story-of-how-amepnka-got-burned-and-the-russians.html&quot;&gt;shot up by 20%, of which some estimates attribute at least 15% of the rise directly on the export deal&lt;/a&gt;. Butz and the other dealmakers were dragged before a furious Congress to testify on what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grain shortages were a windfall for grain farmers, who were getting a higher price for their grain, but bad news for dairy farmers and other livestock farmers who fed their animals with grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make up for the grain shortfall, Butz removed all production limits on grain and fervently encouraged farmers to go wild with production, to plant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agweek.com/opinion/columns/4425097-considering-lessons-earl-butz&quot;&gt;“from fencerow to fencerow” and “get big or get out.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were quickly apparent, as before his USDA tenure was finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/13/archives/why-they-love-earl-butz-prosperous-farmers-see-him-as-the-greatest.html&quot;&gt;Butz became a pariah to everyone but the big farmers&lt;/a&gt; as small farmers went bust under the continual tightening of the efficiency noose (Butz of course had no sympathy for these “inefficient” farms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not the whole story, Butz’s era was undoubtedly a major turning point in orienting our food economy towards consolidation and concentration of production in fewer and fewer hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rise-of-the-cafos&quot;&gt;Rise of the CAFOs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of dairy and the continual shrinking of profit margins have led to drastic changes to the industry over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One change is that through selective breeding, improved nutrition, increased milking frequency and other factors, the amount of milk that a single cow yields per year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wpr.org/how-we-produce-more-milk-fewer-cows&quot;&gt;has more than doubled since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the overall number of cows have decreased a bit, the number of &lt;em&gt;herds&lt;/em&gt; of cows, i.e. the number of farming operations, have decreased &lt;strong&gt;dramatically&lt;/strong&gt; (and continues to do so - the latest count on the rate of change is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hoards.com/article-23968-wisconsin-losing-almost-two-dairies-per-day.html&quot;&gt;two dairy farms per day closing&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the average number of cows on a given dairy operation has greatly risen, i.e. dairy farms have become much denser in terms of livestock. Looking at government statistics on dairy farm profitability, the reason this is happening (and the reason the trend will only continue) seems to be obvious - only farms with thousands of cows, that can use their size to cut costs, are able to operate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_black&quot;&gt;in the black&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only dairy farms that have been able to turn a profit (net value above zero) since the USDA began collecting statistics on dairy production in 2010 are the very largest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes have given rise to a whole new type of livestock farm: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_animal_feeding_operation&quot;&gt;Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation&lt;/a&gt;, or CAFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAFOs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/livestock/afo/&quot;&gt;defined by the EPA&lt;/a&gt; as “an AFO [Animal Feeding Operation] with more than 1000 animal units” (which for dairy, is 700 dairy cows, either milking or dry) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; “any size AFO that discharges manure or wastewater into a natural or man-made ditch, stream or other waterway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of livestock on small plots of land and the large-scale industrialization of these farming operations have given rise to new negative externalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAFO livestock produce literal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_lagoon&quot;&gt;manure lagoons&lt;/a&gt;. There is so much manure produced that a huge pit must be dug, fitted with a liner, and the manure is dumped in, forming an artificial lake made of animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 640px, (max-width: 480px) 960px, 1440px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm/manure-lagoon-7fcc1c2d75739216062977252e34c8572b0c8b70ce76293b35a732333c6f6130.jpg&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-f8wcLXVzkhYGKXclLjTIVysMi3DOdik7NacyMzxvYTA=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/db4c78-fd2297520b638b34c564fef685936df7d34d4a38bfb3472b9b053d0436a7668d.jpg 640w, /assets/3ba0da-cb2c557334e656a91bb8c27face6511f88b11f290b4e176526b3c4bb3df9420c.jpg 960w, /assets/255910-1fa54681520cf8dcde47fd3c075b41a252ce5eeb75751d3072865d70e7d18e2c.jpg 1440w&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical manure lagoon.

&lt;p&gt;These manure lagoons are open-air, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_lagoon#Environmental_and_health_impacts&quot;&gt;the toxic fumes elevate rates of asthma in children living nearby&lt;/a&gt;. The liquid itself contains toxic chemicals, pathogens, and bacteria, and if it leaks out (say during heavy rainfall), is devastating to nearby communities as it contaminates the local water table, where people draw their well water from, and destroys local bodies of water where wildlife live and people recreate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the number of cows on these operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Wells/HighCap/&quot;&gt;high capacity wells that draw over 100,000 gallons of water per day&lt;/a&gt; are required in order to draw enough water for all the livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rural Wisconsin, our natural water supply is beginning to be destroyed through a combination of manure and fertilizer spills contaminating our well water, and high capacity wells sucking out so much water that it’s disrupting the water table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/Understanding_CAFOs_NALBOH.pdf&quot;&gt;pretty damning 2010 CDC report on CAFOs&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading in its entirety,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agriculture sector, including CAFOs, is the leading contributor of pollutants to lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. It has been found that states with high concentrations of CAFOs experience on average 20 to 30 serious water quality problems per year as a result of manure management problems (EPA, 2001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report goes on to describe the long-term damage from even a single manure spill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When groundwater is contaminated by pathogenic organisms, a serious threat to drinking water can occur. Pathogens survive longer in groundwater than surface water due to lower temperatures and protection from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the contamination appears to be a single episode, viruses could become attached to sediment near groundwater and continue to leach slowly into groundwater. One pollution event by a CAFO could become a lingering source of viral contamination for groundwater (EPA, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groundwater can still be at risk for contamination after a CAFO has closed and its lagoons are empty. When given increased air exposure, ammonia in soil transforms into nitrates. Nitrates are highly mobile in soil, and will reach groundwater quicker than ammonia. It can be dangerous to ignore contaminated soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a CAFO has contaminated a water system, community members should be concerned about nitrates and nitrate poisoning. Elevated nitrates in drinking water can be especially harmful to infants, leading to blue baby syndrome and possible death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some real-world examples, in Wisconsin in 2017 a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/baby-s-death-sparks-water-safety-fight-with-the-ag-industry/502477031/&quot;&gt;baby died from blue baby syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a condition linked to high nitrates, in a community in Armenia, WI which had been experiencing a spike in private well nitrate levels after a 6,000-head dairy CAFO set up shop there. In the central sands region of Wisconsin, rivers such as the Little Plover, which was a notably good trout stream, have nearly dried up entirely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wpr.org/answers-water-management-central-sands-region-arent-simple&quot;&gt;from the substantial use of high capacity wells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kewaunee County in northeast Wisconsin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/ct/news/local/environment/bacteria-in-state-s-drinking-water-is-public-health-crisis/article_dd9b5d97-084b-5337-a664-37b9a6b36d30.html&quot;&gt;more than one-third (!) of 320 wells tested&lt;/a&gt; were found to be unsafe to use due to unsafe levels of coliform bacteria or nitrates. In 2004 in that region, a six-month-old became violently ill after taking a bath in water poisoned by manure runoff. A state representative called the situation there a &lt;a href=&quot;http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/democrats/news/2015-press-releases/groundwater-protection-bill/&quot;&gt;“public health crisis.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 in Juneau County, a man was &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/environment/manure-spraying-under-scrutiny/article_66a5b80b-b8c8-5daf-92ec-3d24585f35ea.html&quot;&gt;forced to sell&lt;/a&gt; the home he had lived in for 20 years after a CAFO began repurposing water irrigation systems to spray manure, and the liquid soaked into the walls of his home (“It was an ammonia smell. It hurt so bad even to breathe,” he said).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides environmental externalities, it’s also an open secret that these CAFOs heavily rely on undocumented immigrants for their day-to-day labor, particularly the parlor milking setups. In a recent news story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23471864/devin-nunes-family-farm-iowa-california/&quot;&gt;Congressman Devin Nunes’s family’s large dairy farm in Iowa got busted&lt;/a&gt; for such practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 640px, (max-width: 480px) 960px, 1440px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm/cafo-spanish-ad-aba62132de38d987d1780d293773c2fddf0babb83e0f8a539de425f19bf43821.png&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-q6YhMt442YfReA0pN3PC/d8Lq7g+D4pTneQl8Zv0OCE=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/c69691-e942dcb2bbfe8e06c540142bf3598fcade43b034564b19e63d4930a862391032.png 640w, /assets/029604-d4e09f140857def22669876decdfce0bfd65007bf687c247fbcac95fb9d879c5.png 960w, /assets/617ffc-34d86cc4453444b3637aee364694c2419fda77385e62c0dcdadacb4325a20db6.png 1440w&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dairy CAFO located in a tiny Wisconsin village pins &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190215191027/https://www.facebook.com/BandDDairy/photos/a.2093550150919217/2093548550919377/?type=3&amp;amp;permPage=1&quot;&gt;an ad for workers written in Spanish&lt;/a&gt; to their Facebook page. There's no ad in English 🤔&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a dig towards the immigrants - I married a Mexican woman and I love my inlaws and their culture dearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to remember that farms are in competition with each other for labor, land, and other resources. In this case, my brother and other family farms struggle and pay dearly to hire and retain legal workers at a high cost. Other farms, particularly the large ones, pay lower costs for illegal labor and externalize the costs of depressed wages onto everyone else, not unlike externalizing the costs of their pollution. It’s not a fair playing field to compete on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-cafo-neighbor&quot;&gt;Our CAFO neighbor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a mile down the road from my family’s farm is the largest CAFO in our county, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/AgBusiness/data/CAFO/cafo_det.asp?CountyChoice=Barron&amp;amp;Submit=Submit&amp;amp;PERMIT_NO=64397&quot;&gt;over 5,000 head of cattle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This CAFO has received &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/epa_violation_report-df05c592b187d2fb3e57cd17383893aad565ddf97f149945d847b0f4ed863b73.csv&quot;&gt;four Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) violations&lt;/a&gt; from the EPA, two of which are due to coliform bacteria counts, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://echo.epa.gov/detailed-facility-report?fid=110040433395&quot;&gt;one Clean Waters Act (CWA) violation&lt;/a&gt; for discharging into a wetland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the federally-documented violations, anyway. My mom took some video of a leak about a month after the EPA-documented CWA violation which traveled down the hill into a creek that runs through my parents’ property, killing the wildlife there for God knows how long:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CAFO is now going through the process of installing a manure pipeline to move waste around to various fields - so far through private lands, but apparently they are also pursuing public right-of-ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s terrifying to consider how rapidly and how severely the water table and nearby wetlands could be damaged if this pipeline were to burst or leak, and how much manure could be pumped out below the topsoil before being detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spoke to the county’s conservation officer who had nothing but good things to say about the pipeline and how it will get tanker trucks off the roads, how a pipeline is safer for the environment, and how leaks would be stopped by shutoff valves. That may be true, but yet you can easily find news reports of manure pipeline leaks. When I asked my mom her thoughts, she told me there was allegedly a pipeline break already which sprayed manure across a neighbor’s yard and house, and showed me some pictures she took of the cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;

Picture courtesy my mom.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my brother Noah, who is taking over the farm, having the county’s biggest CAFO nearby unfortunately puts a competetive strain on his already-difficult situation. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/AgBusiness/documents/LargeDairyCAFOGP-WPDESPermit.pdf&quot;&gt;Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit requirements&lt;/a&gt; require these CAFOs to own or rent enough land to spread manure on proportional to the amount of cows they have, this multi-million dollar corporation down the road is under land-pressure, and gobbles up all farming land in the area often before it’s even on the market. This makes it harder for my brother to find farmland to buy or rent nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure-of-the-cooperatives&quot;&gt;Failure of the cooperatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing I’d like to touch on is the failure of the farmer cooperatives in this era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably well-known that there have been periods where farmers have went through tough times, and going back to at least the 1920s, farmers have formed voluntary cooperatives (co-ops) to help one another out by pooling resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this quaint 1940s-era video for an explainer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLVqXrATB5w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the modern reality is that through repeated mergers, farming cooperatives have conglomerated into corporate behemoths. The co-op’s presence in a farming community today is as a local outpost that belongs to a sprawling empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my family’s farm area the co-op conglomerate is Cenex, a.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHS_Inc.&quot;&gt;CHS Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Fortune 100 company (!). And they’re not the only Fortune 100 farmer co-op either - there was once &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmland_Industries&quot;&gt;Farmland Industries&lt;/a&gt;, which imploded from the kind of financial stupidity that can only happen when you grow too large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for all the mergers and supposed efficiency gained by the local cooperative turning into a corporate dragon, my brother gets cheaper seeds by buying them from one dude starting up his own business out of the back of his truck, compared to the local co-op’s prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told other services provided by the co-op suffer from massive inefficiencies as well - too many managers and idle workers at the headquarters, too many trucks show up concurrently at job sites leading to idle workers, inefficient truck routes, etc. The types of issues that crop up when there aren’t any farmers in the mix at the co-op any more - there’s no “skin in the game,” and no connection to the farmers being served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same kind of stuff happens with the cooperative creameries - the place where dairy farmers send their milk to be processed. You wouldn’t know there was a crisis going on looking at this creamery’s newsletter, with puff pieces about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ellsworthcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ECC-Patron-Newsletter-11-18-2-compressed.pdf&quot;&gt;cheese curds showing up on the QVC channel&lt;/a&gt;, or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ellsworthcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ECC-Patron-Newsletter-05-18.compressed.pdf&quot;&gt;a director’s jetsetting trips to China&lt;/a&gt; and how impressed the locals were he could use chopsticks. Meanwhile member farmers (patrons) are getting the lowest milk checks from the creamery they’ve ever gotten. Yet somehow the board of this creamery had enough cash to allegedly buy another creamery to the tune of $6 million without bringing it up for a patron vote nor mentioning their intention at their annual meeting.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:creamery-nothing-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers are generally scared to speak up about this kind of stuff for fear of getting dumped by their creamery and having nowhere to send their milk (because creameries serve limited geographic areas, a farmer may have very few - perhaps even just one - options for where to send their milk). With the overabundance of milk supply, the feeling is that creameries are on the lookout for ways to lower their supply burden by getting rid of patrons.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:patron-loss&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not being able to sell their milk is obviously a death knell for a dairy farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being, farmer cooperatives were once local institutions bootstrapped by the farmers themselves, but now they too have fallen into the trap of corporate consolidation and become disconnected from the people they were meant to serve. Now, in hard times, these institutions have become a source of anxiety - at best an indifferent, inefficient use of resources, and at worst a potential hostile actor that could destroy you. Something unthinkable compared to their founding principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-solution-in-sight&quot;&gt;No solution in sight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s now happening in the final stages to the American family dairy farm has already happened to other food and livestock industries in this country.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ilsr-podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Notably poultry, as poultry farmers nowadays &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/22/chicken-farmers-big-poultry-rules&quot;&gt;are more or less serfs&lt;/a&gt; to a handful of huge corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a time some thought it would be possible for small dairy farms to escape to a niche like organic, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/dairy-farming-is-dying-after-40-years-im-out/2018/12/21/79cd63e4-0314-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html?utm_term=.c1bc6568672b&quot;&gt;even those farms are going bust&lt;/a&gt; as the large corporate farms have penetrated that market and flooded it with product (even if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/why-your-organic-milk-may-not-be-organic/2017/05/01/708ce5bc-ed76-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html?utm_term=.cd7861a9a8a2&quot;&gt;they probably aren’t following&lt;/a&gt; the already-lax USDA regulations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it may have been possible to save the family dairy farm at some point, probably through a supply management program similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_management_(Canada)&quot;&gt;what Canada has&lt;/a&gt;. There are all sorts of arguments to be made for or against such a system but by all accounts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war&quot;&gt;Canadian farmers and consumers are generally happy&lt;/a&gt; with their setup up there. The 2014 Farm Bill would’ve been a good start; it included an oversupply management mechanism, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dairyforward.com/page/PolicySuccesses&quot;&gt;CAFO lobbyist groups like the Dairy Business Association&lt;/a&gt; pushed a last-minute amendment to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at this point for America, the cow is out of the barn so to speak and it’s too late for our family dairy farmers. As dairy farms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-pace-hit-highest-loss-dairy-farms-4-years&quot;&gt;continue to close at record levels&lt;/a&gt;, the consolidation into large corporate farms will continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a taste of what the near future looks like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.milkbusiness.com/article/walmart-opens-indiana-milk-plant&quot;&gt;Wal-Mart already began bottling their own milk&lt;/a&gt;, shutting down over 100 dairy producers in the process. As for the distant future, I imagine it will look similar to the consolidation in other livestock industries, where a handful of mega corporations dictate production and the “farmers” are more like serfs, deeply in debt and entirely beholden to the corporation. I already mentioned poultry farming, but also look at hog farming: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agriculture.com/livestock/pork-powerhouses/pork-powerhouses-2018-ramping-up&quot;&gt;largest hog producer&lt;/a&gt; in the country, Smithfield Foods, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/29/smithfield-foods-china-acquisition/2368671/&quot;&gt;now owned by a Chinese corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and which is responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-is-china-treating-north-carolina-like-the-developing-world-122892/&quot;&gt;staggering amounts of damage&lt;/a&gt; to rural American communities due to the concentrated waste it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of efficiency, profits will be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands while waste gets concentrated into more and more toxic forms to be dumped on rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up on a dairy farm is a very unique experience that I was fortunate to have. The farm was woven through all aspects of our family’s life, and the success of our family depended on everyone’s contribution to the farm. Family bonds were tempered by working with each other every day, and together overcoming the minor crises that arose (cows getting out, equipment breaking down, etc.). That’s why I used “death” in this article’s title; while it may seem melodramatic to some, that is what it feels like to me - like a piece of the family is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 640px, (max-width: 480px) 960px, 1440px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm/john-fertilizer-92fd35560a34e9af98607a9468ddf92ca99c546b6ca9f8b78d64c044a9bb5fef.jpg&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-kv01Vgo06a+YYHqUaN35LKmcVGtsqfi3jWTARKm7X+8=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/d71fdf-d6fceb32b18346b31facd57a95e6ddfdae2288f53a3ffc95ed948e65e3be3d31.jpg 640w, /assets/47eea7-3205fbfbaeae63b24f17f2209608c2e2661b89b00b968ff40c733ac0c266f17b.jpg 960w, /assets/985aa4-92bdaa750db2d72feffe83dd8c0bffe5876ac09947f3e146dd21f4ad33f37002.jpg 1440w&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brother John coming back from spreading fertilizer, holding his daughter&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get a little taste of many things working on a farm, from agricultural, to construction (e.g. building and fixing up areas of the barn), to engineering (e.g. designing ad-hoc fixes to broken implements in the field), to mechanical and engine repair (e.g. fixing tractors and welding implements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saddens me that my brother Noah won’t be able to pass that legacy on to his daughter, and I can’t give my own kids a glimmer of it by having them work on the farm over the summers (and neither can my nieces or nephews).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a loss for Wisconsin’s culture - “America’s Dairyland” - that we aren’t going to have farm kids coming up any more,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:joe-rogan&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and our rural pastoral landscape that was dotted with barns, silos, and pastures with grazing cattle is being replaced by an industrial one with huge buildings, heavy machine traffic, and artificial lakes made of animal waste. Those of us who grew up in these rural areas and moved out but longed to return can’t even bear to do so any longer because the land has been blighted.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:message-board&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 640px, (max-width: 480px) 960px, 1440px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/assets/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm/cousins-eggs-66c1d95086a6431c0edcf3ed04551c6137794387477bfcdbe0283767605485eb.jpg&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-ZsHZUIamQxwO3PPtBFUcYTd5Q4dHe/zb4Cg3Z2BUhes=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/6d07a1-79a8ef32c9f98e25127935734a15891969195164fcfcb115a9ef0049889ac237.jpg 640w, /assets/02fd4e-5b261a265939833d409d3c78b4db10fe1dca700208d5531d45b1e2d62efe6afb.jpg 960w, /assets/987ad0-1d22cc317566aa5425a43fbe5803c4af1b702eaf7284d119b34645aba5ae5cde.jpg 1440w&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cousins gathering eggs from my parents' chicken coop&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the future is still uncertain for my kid brother Noah, I have no doubt he will succeed at whatever he puts his mind to. He’s got brains, talent, and a god-tier work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything good to come of the situation, I am glad at least that he’ll be freed from the burden of having cows, which require one to be out in the barn every single day without end. It will also be a relief to my dad, who I mentioned earlier is now in his seventies and still has to work out in the barn every day because of the difficulty in hiring legal farmhands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, these family bonds that were forged on the farm remain, and we will take care of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-can-do&quot;&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I don’t think there’s anything on the horizon that would save family dairy farms, save for a supply management program suddenly appearing like a deus ex machina and solving the overproduction problem. I suggest lobbying your representatives for supporting such a measure in a future Farm Bill, and/or supporting family farm organizations who are fighting for that and other measures such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in a rural or semi-rural area, it’s critical you pay attention to what’s going on in your local area. CAFOs will continue to grow and spread, and through organizations like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dairyforward.com/&quot;&gt;Dairy Business Association&lt;/a&gt; lobby for laws giving them freer ability to pollute the air, water, and land that we all need in order to survive. I suggest proactively lobbying your city or township to pass ordinances banning polluting activities in your area and restrictions that prevent CAFOs from operating in your area (otherwise you might &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/oconto-county/2018/09/14/neighbors-sue-stop-nearly-finished-manure-pit-oconto-co/1292391002/&quot;&gt;end up on the defensive&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly impossible to win). Some organizations that defend Wisconsin’s water you can support are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone, including cityfolk, must get educated on what is going on with our food economy, and the dangerous direction it has taken. I’m still getting educated myself so am open to suggestions, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefern.org/&quot;&gt;Food and Environment Reporting Network&lt;/a&gt; seems to do good work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also recommend everyone, but especially rural folks support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilsr.org/&quot;&gt;Institute for Local Self-Reliance&lt;/a&gt;, as they work hard on several fronts (including another issue dear to my heart, improving broadband access) to empower local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is based solely on my own reflection and attempts to understand the systemic changes that affected my family’s dairy farm. Any mistakes I made are solely my own and do not reflect upon anyone else mentioned in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time writing this post but there are so many other issues that I wasn’t able to even get to. For example, the startling rate of farmers committing suicide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/why-are-americas-farmers-killing-themselves-in-record-numbers&quot;&gt;more than double that of veterans&lt;/a&gt;), which hit close to home when the man who visited our farm my entire life in his familiar white truck and sold my dad farm equipment killed himself (RIP Marty); to creamery cooperative mismanagement and ineffectiveness and the farmers doing battle with their own creameries, and the general failure of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capper%E2%80%93Volstead_Act&quot;&gt;Capper-Volstead Act&lt;/a&gt;; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farm-equipment.com/articles/15963-whats-driving-consolidation-among-farm-equipment-dealers&quot;&gt;consolidation of the farm implement industry&lt;/a&gt;; to John Deere doing some shady things (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-18/farmers-go-broke-john-deere-ramps-its-captive-financing-operation-keep-ag-party-goin&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzp7ny/tractor-hacking-right-to-repair&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;); to statistical changes of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/price-spreads-from-farm-to-consumer/&quot;&gt;price spread from farm to consumer&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. the amount of money farmers get from a gallon of milk or other dairy products compared to their retail cost); to digging into the nasty things CAFO lobbyists are doing; to rural communities fighting against CAFOs in their area; to Trump’s tariffs and a certain political anger people direct at farmers; and so many more I regret I wasn’t able to do justice to.&lt;/p&gt;
