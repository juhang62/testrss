<title>MixedName – Bilingual baby name finder</title>

<description>&lt;img id=&quot;hands&quot; src=&quot;https://mixedname.com/hands_cropped_fade_compressed.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mixednamea&quot;&gt;Mixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mixednameb&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the names in common between two languages to find one that works in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect for parents from two different language backgrounds looking for a bilingual cross-language compatible name for their baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;index_button&quot;&gt;Find Names&lt;/button&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;yo&quot; class=&quot;yo&quot;&gt;yo be real&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;personal&quot; readability=&quot;37.398058252427&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I made this site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our Japanese-Finnish son was born, we wanted to find a name that would work in both languages. To help with the search I wrote a simple tool for personal use to look through all the names in both Japanese and Finnish, finding ones which appear in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking others might find it useful as well, years later I went back and improved it to the point that I could release it online, which is the page you are now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool currently supports 41 different languages or cultures. For example if you are German and your wife is Klingon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixedname.com/german_klingon_masculine_names&quot;&gt;it can tell you&lt;/a&gt; that the only name option is &quot;Arne&quot;. In other words, it finds the intersection of two name lists. Some languages don't have many options, so it also tries a fuzzy search and some other strategies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of these are found by software, there are no guarantees that the names are any good (for instance it sometimes suggests &quot;Timo&quot; for an Italian name, which wouldn't be great), so it is intended to only give you ideas to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like it. Oh, and here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixedname.com/finnish_japanese_masculine_names&quot;&gt;Japanese-Finnish names&lt;/a&gt; it found for us. We ended up going with a completely unique one that wasn't in the list, but just having a list to work with was a nice start for our name brainstorming session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions or just want to say hi?&lt;br/&gt;Feel free to email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:me@bemmu.com&quot;&gt;me@bemmu.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Preparing Our Partners for iOS 14</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/business/news/preparing-our-partners-for-ios-14-launch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/business/news/preparing-our-partners-for-ios-14-launch/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;40.520131086142&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_4971&quot;&gt;Given the impact the policy will have on businesses’ ability to market themselves and monetize through ads, we’re sharing how we’re addressing iOS 14 changes and providing recommendations to help our partners prepare, while developers await more details on this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_4971&quot;&gt;First, we will not collect the identifier for advertisers (IDFA) on our own apps on iOS 14 devices. We believe this approach provides as much certainty and stability that we can provide our partners at this time. We may revisit this decision as Apple offers more guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_4971&quot;&gt;Additionally, we will remind users that they have a choice about how their information is used on Facebook and about our &lt;a class=&quot;_3cr5 _8p_9 _53m5 _8xo6 _8xo4 _1s6a _8xo7&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/off-facebook-activity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-ms=&quot;{&amp;quot;creative_detail&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;FBABout_OffFacebookActivity_Article_InlineText&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;creative&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;link&amp;quot;}&quot; id=&quot;u_0_ft&quot;&gt;Off-Facebook Activity&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows them to see a summary of the off-Facebook app and website activity businesses send to Facebook and disconnect it from their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_4971&quot;&gt;There are a few things our partners should know to prepare for iOS 14. First, we will release an updated version of the Facebook SDK to support iOS 14. The new version of the Facebook SDK will provide support for Apple’s SKAdNetwork API, which limits the data available to businesses for running and measuring campaigns. In light of these limitations, and in an effort to mitigate the impact on the efficacy of app install campaign measurement, we will also ask businesses to create a new ad account dedicated to running app install ad campaigns for iOS 14 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_4971&quot;&gt;We expect these changes will disproportionately affect Audience Network given its heavy dependence on app advertising. Like all ad networks on iOS 14, advertiser ability to accurately target and measure their campaigns on Audience Network will be impacted, and as a result publishers should expect their ability to effectively monetize on Audience Network to decrease. Ultimately, despite our best efforts, Apple’s updates may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14. We expect less impact to our own advertising business, and we’re committed to supporting advertisers and publishers through these updates. Learn more about the impact to Audience Network &lt;a class=&quot;_3cr5 _8p_9 _53m5 _8xo6 _8xo4 _1s6a _8xo7&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/preparing-audience-network-for-ios14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-ms=&quot;{&amp;quot;creative_detail&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;FBAudienceNetwork_Here_Article_InlineText&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;creative&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;link&amp;quot;}&quot; id=&quot;u_0_fu&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;10.844129554656&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_5yvq&quot;&gt;We believe that industry consultation is critical for changes to platform policies, as these updates have a far-reaching impact on the developer ecosystem. We’re encouraged by conversations and efforts already taking place in the industry - including within the World Wide Web Consortium (&lt;a class=&quot;_3cr5 _8p_9 _53m5 _8xo6 _8xo4 _1s6a _8xo7&quot; href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F&amp;amp;h=AT38Vez-8Tlf_QZi071onNIqPneBySLM7bcimuPjSKI87mrO6kgYhJGe5tOSprxpc3hqRi0_mYT5UUGC4p7Ta9wYqZJmA4uMkfIJk0F23TQ-g2901fG0RFFvgbtJ6TyHSK62DWsRSbDMl1OjfG9R&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-ms=&quot;{&amp;quot;creative_detail&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;W3C_W3C_Article_InlineText&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;creative&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;link&amp;quot;}&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-lynx-mode=&quot;hover&quot; id=&quot;u_0_fv&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;) and the recently announced Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media (&lt;a class=&quot;_3cr5 _8p_9 _53m5 _8xo6 _8xo4 _1s6a _8xo7&quot; href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ana.net%2Fcontent%2Fshow%2Fid%2FResponsibleAddressableMedia%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520Partnership%2520for%2520Responsible%2520Addressable%2Cdigital%2520media%2520and%2520advertising%252C%2520while&amp;amp;h=AT2UNW8T9hcjV0sZ7DkEWbzFEBwChcf7LheeNkua9US8iiHkMM59N8JTCE8WjJwUlhO8_eGGTDO-LxGerlLYNWcuT-m5a5a6e3leCq47-_2EwO5AKxMsc0ZdNZeaAyRJlXrKdirk6dp4QA0SuXa_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-ms=&quot;{&amp;quot;creative_detail&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ANA_PRAM_Article_InlineText&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;creative&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;link&amp;quot;}&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-lynx-mode=&quot;hover&quot; id=&quot;u_0_fw&quot;&gt;PRAM&lt;/a&gt;).

<title>Portland passes low-density zoning reform</title>
<link>https://www.sightline.org/2020/08/11/on-wednesday-portland-will-pass-the-best-low-density-zoning-reform-in-us-history/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sightline.org/2020/08/11/on-wednesday-portland-will-pass-the-best-low-density-zoning-reform-in-us-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Portland’s city council set a new bar for North American housing reform Wednesday by legalizing up to four homes on almost any residential lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portland.gov/bps/rip&quot;&gt;new rules&lt;/a&gt; will also offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2020/01/10/do-portlands-low-density-zones-need-a-deeper-affordability-option/&quot;&gt;a “deeper affordability” option&lt;/a&gt;: four to six homes on any lot if at least half are available to low-income Portlanders at regulated, affordable prices. The measure will make it viable for nonprofits to intersperse below-market housing anywhere in the city &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/05/25/a-century-of-exclusion-portlands-1924-rezone-is-still-coded-on-its-streets/&quot;&gt;for the first time in a century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And among other things it will remove all parking mandates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFDKY0MLr-Pj1FDCtCiJzEDdfK8DDGOQg4PlA_9U87U/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;three quarters&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s residential land, combining with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theparkingminute.com/portland-takes-one-more-step-toward-zero-parking-requirements/&quot;&gt;recent reform of apartment zones&lt;/a&gt; to essentially make home driveways optional citywide for the first time since &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;amp;context=oscdl_planning#page=37&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the most pro-housing reform to low-density zones in US history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Residential Infill Project,” as it’s known, melds ideas pioneered recently by Minneapolis and Austin and goes well beyond the requirements of a state law Oregon passed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal passed 3-1. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=%22residential+infill+project%22+controversial&quot;&gt;years of local headlines&lt;/a&gt; describing the proposal as “controversial,” both of the council members up for re-election see their “yes” votes as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.votechloe.com/housing&quot;&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tedwheeler/status/1217569310945579008?lang=en&quot;&gt;accomplishments&lt;/a&gt;. Of the council’s two open seats, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://portlandneighborswelcome.org/carmen-rubio&quot;&gt;commissioner-elect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://portlandneighborswelcome.org/loretta-smith&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://portlandneighborswelcome.org/dan-ryan&quot;&gt;candidates&lt;/a&gt; in Tuesday’s council runoff had also endorsed its principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_78062&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-scaled.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-78062&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-78062 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-772x772.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A rendering, by Alfred Twu, of the housing options Portland's residential infill project would legalize.&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height=&quot;772&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-772x772.jpg 772w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-275x275.jpg 275w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-768x768.jpg 768w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-550x550.jpg 550w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sightline-portland-2020-08-151-600x600.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ted Wheeler, a business-oriented former Republican turned center-left Democrat, allied with two colleagues on his political left to pass the reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can’t wait to vote to get this thing implemented,” Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hqtvAEnMis&amp;amp;list=PL4m94lCOY10kcH-ufAjNIh1ntElCElA4_&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;t=0s&quot;&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt;, citing it as a step toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/08/21/did-segregation-cause-your-traffic-jam/&quot;&gt;repairing&lt;/a&gt; what the city government now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2019-12/portlandracistplanninghistoryreport.pdf&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as its own history of “creating and enforcing racial segregation and inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m ready to move forward,” Commissioner Chloe Eudaly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hqtvAEnMis&amp;amp;list=PL4m94lCOY10kcH-ufAjNIh1ntElCElA4_&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;t=0s&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt;, after securing Wheeler’s support for a formal city effort to create a new “tenant opportunity to purchase” program when rental buildings are sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one “no” vote was Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who first cut her political teeth fighting infill in her neighborhood in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A snail’s-pace project that kept getting better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_78008&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-78008&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-78008 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-772x511.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height=&quot;511&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-772x511.jpg 772w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-275x182.jpg 275w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-768x509.jpg 768w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-2048x1356.jpg 2048w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-563x373.jpg 563w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-453x300.jpg 453w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nice-hill-triplex-and-bike-600x397.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-78008&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An existing triplex in Southeast Portland, built before their 1959 ban.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six years since the residential infill project’s concept was floated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-Updates-to-Meet-Portlands-Future-Housing-Needs.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/hot-houses/Content?oid=910298&quot;&gt;local micro-developer&lt;/a&gt;, Portland leaders have weighed and delayed it again and again, sending it back multiple times through the city’s wringer of public process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every time the plan was exposed to public opinion, it became more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the council unanimously agreed in concept to legalizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/2016/12/council_approves_infill_concep.html&quot;&gt;duplexes and corner triplexes in part of the city&lt;/a&gt;, plus a sharp restriction in building size. In 2018, after two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/05/17/cascadias-entire-housing-debate-in-two-two-minute-videos/&quot;&gt;epic public hearings&lt;/a&gt;, the plan shifted to allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/09/17/residential-infill-project-portland-oregon/&quot;&gt;up to four homes in any project&lt;/a&gt;, plus two crucial tweaks: an end to mandatory parking and extra size allowances for buildings that created more or cheaper homes. In 2019, Oregon’s legislature took up the issue, led by a former fourplex resident: Portland-based House Speaker Tina Kotek. That led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/06/30/oregon-just-voted-to-legalize-duplexes-on-almost-every-city-lot/&quot;&gt;groundbreaking state law&lt;/a&gt; legalizing “middle housing” of up to four homes throughout the Portland metro area, but stopping short of allowing it on any lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 2020, Wheeler still couldn’t find the votes for the local reform—until another pair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PNWelcome/status/1217565980852809728&quot;&gt;hours-long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PNWelcome/status/1217974361560248320&quot;&gt;hearings&lt;/a&gt;, in which pro-housing voices led by the advocacy groups &lt;a href=&quot;http://portlandneighborswelcome.org&quot;&gt;Portland: Neighbors Welcome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/antidisplacementpdx/&quot;&gt;Anti-Displacement PDX&lt;/a&gt; united around the concepts of adding the “deeper affordability” sixplex amendment and simultaneously pursuing other tenant protections like Eudaly’s “tenant opportunity to purchase” concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At those hearings, pro-housing testimony outnumbered anti-housing testimony more than six to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process, the backers were a &lt;a href=&quot;https://portlandneighborswelcome.org/reasons-to-support-infill&quot;&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; of affordable housing developers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/testimony/item.cfm#itemID=83047&quot;&gt;Hacienda Community Development&lt;/a&gt;, stable-housing advocates like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingcully.org/2016/02/more-than-100-neighbors-join-chat-on-february-2nd/&quot;&gt;Cully Housing Action Team&lt;/a&gt;, environmentalists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunrisepdx.org/&quot;&gt;Sunrise PDX&lt;/a&gt;, justice advocates like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/testimony/item.cfm#recordType=all&amp;amp;itemID=72944&quot;&gt;AARP Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, civic groups like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/testimony/item.cfm#search=northeast%20coalition&amp;amp;itemID=72765&quot;&gt;Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;, transportation reformers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/testimony/item.cfm#recordType=All&amp;amp;itemID=83039&quot;&gt;Oregon Walks&lt;/a&gt;, and dozens of active volunteers, with years of staffed organizing work by the anti-sprawl nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/testimony/item.cfm#search=sean%20carpenter&amp;amp;itemID=83040&quot;&gt;1000 Friends of Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and, later, us at Sightline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who knew putting people at city council, testifying, writing letters and convincing their elected officials could change public policy?” Commissioner Hardesty &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andersem/status/1281340905174134784&quot;&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;, admitting that until she’d heard from the public, even she had thought the sixplex concept was too radical to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This follows and surpasses reforms in other cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_74658&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-74658&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-74658&quot; src=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-772x579.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-772x579.jpg 772w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-275x206.jpg 275w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-563x422.jpg 563w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-400x300.jpg 400w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sixplex.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland’s reform will build on similar actions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/09/20/duplexes-are-now-legal-on-99-of-vancouvers-low-density-lots/&quot;&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/12/10/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing/&quot;&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, whose leaders voted in 2018 to re-legalize duplexes and triplexes, respectively; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/07/01/seattle-approves-best-backyard-cottages-rules-united-states/&quot;&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, where a 2019 reform to accessory cottages resulted in something very close to citywide triplex legalization; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://austin.curbed.com/2019/5/13/18618370/affordable-housing-austin-density-zoning-plan&quot;&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, whose council passed a very similar sixplex-with-affordability proposal in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Portland’s changes are likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/06/21/this-is-what-a-street-looks-like-39-years-after-legalizing-fourplexes/&quot;&gt;gradually&lt;/a&gt; result in more actual homes than any of those milestone reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because in both Vancouver and Minneapolis, city laws in low-density zones cap the size of new buildings no matter how many homes they create. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.municode.com/mn/minneapolis/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=MICOOR_TIT20ZOCO_CH546REDI_ARTIIR1MUMIDI_546.240BUBURE&quot;&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the interior square footage of a building can be up to half the square footage of its lot: 2,500 square feet of housing on a hypothetical 5,000 square foot lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland’s new rules set that same size limit for one-unit buildings. But Portland’s duplexes will be up to three-fifths the square footage of their lot, and triplexes and fourplexes up to 0.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is for that extra square footage to work like a sluice gate for Portland’s housing market, rechanneling investment away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@pdx4all/every-month-portlands-infill-rules-aren-t-changed-the-city-looks-more-like-this-23686e1b9179&quot;&gt;luxury remodels and McMansions&lt;/a&gt; and toward new homes that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/02/13/who-would-live-in-missing-middle-housing-the-middle-class/&quot;&gt;affordable to the middle class on day one&lt;/a&gt;. Low-density parts of Vancouver and Minneapolis currently have no such distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_74659&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-74659&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-74659&quot; src=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;761&quot; height=&quot;482&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year.png 761w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year-275x174.png 275w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year-563x357.png 563w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year-474x300.png 474w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/housing-supply-per-year-600x380.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Seattle, that city still bans new housing from the driveways of most primary homes, making infill geometrically impossible in many cases. Vancouver does, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin’s sixplex concept is a different matter. Splitting the fixed cost of a lot among even six homes doesn’t generally bring development prices low enough to be built without subsidy. So until Austin matches its excellent affordable-housing policy with a similar reform to market-rate housing, it’s tying its own hands behind its back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policies like this do, however, serve as a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skwirk.com.au/skwirk/uploadFiles/content/database/files/chapter.2847.body.html&quot;&gt;force multiplier&lt;/a&gt; for nonprofits that are, like Habitat for Humanity, already developing modest homes at below-market prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in January, legalizing sixplexes for regulated-affordable projects is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2020/01/10/do-portlands-low-density-zones-need-a-deeper-affordability-option/&quot;&gt;the economic equivalent of cutting a check for $100,000 or more per affordable home&lt;/a&gt;. It alone may not be enough to make those homes appear, but it makes every existing subsidy go further. And it doesn’t take a dime away from other existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, it makes it feasible for builders like Habitat to gradually scatter such projects through all Portland neighborhoods. It lifts a de facto ban on new affordable housing from much of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is something every city should do – and federal governments should give them a reason to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_78010&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-78010&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-78010&quot; src=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-772x384.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-772x384.jpg 772w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-275x137.jpg 275w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-768x382.jpg 768w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-1536x764.jpg 1536w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-563x280.jpg 563w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-603x300.jpg 603w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600-600x299.jpg 600w, https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pretty-fourplex-front-1600.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-78010&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A fourplex in Portland, built before their 1959 ban.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t take six years for any city to agree to give itself permission to build the sort of homes that every city once allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called “missing middle” housing options like triplexes, courtyard apartments and cottages aren’t radical or even unfamiliar. They’re just scarce—because they’ve been largely banned from cities across Cascadia and the rest of the US and Canada. In Portland, the bans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2018/05/25/a-century-of-exclusion-portlands-1924-rezone-is-still-coded-on-its-streets/&quot;&gt;began in 1924 and expanded almost citywide in 1959&lt;/a&gt;. Almost every city in either country that’s existed for more than a century has a similar story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One effect, in many cities a primary goal, was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/08/21/did-segregation-cause-your-traffic-jam/&quot;&gt;segregate people by class, race, age and income&lt;/a&gt;. But that wasn’t the only effect—bans on the lowest-cost way to create new homes accidentally created scarcity for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, middle-housing bans unexpectedly became a high-profile issue in the US presidential race, as President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2020/8/3/21347565/suburban-lifestyle-dream-trump-tweets-fair-housing&quot;&gt;cheerfully claimed responsibility for rising housing prices&lt;/a&gt;, applauding his administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/07/25/trumps-new-fair-housing-rule-prioritizes-toxic-culture-war-politics-over-deregulation/&quot;&gt;flip-flop&lt;/a&gt; from saying exclusionary zoning is bad (because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curbed.com/2019/6/25/18746417/trump-local-zoning-yimby-nimby-council-ben-carson&quot;&gt;drives up prices&lt;/a&gt;) to saying it is good (because those high prices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/29/trump-housing-policy-low-income-suburbs-386414&quot;&gt;preserve segregation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical issue here, over enforcement of a provision of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TomSugrue/status/1288573975518486533&quot;&gt;isn’t massively important&lt;/a&gt; to the number or price of homes that get built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters more is a battle of big ideas. Is it good to have a diversity of housing types and prices in every neighborhood? Or is it bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, the Democratic Party has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2019/10/14/its-official-dc-politicians-have-woken-up-to-housing-abundance/&quot;&gt;rapidly come around to the position&lt;/a&gt; that it’s good. Its presidential candidate’s platform reflects this: Joe Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2020/7/9/21316912/joe-biden-housing-plan-section-8&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the federal government should withhold various grants from cities that don’t take steps toward the standard Portland is about to set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear which idea will win &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/2020/04/24/how-the-us-government-can-tackle-the-coronavirus-housing-emergency/&quot;&gt;this new federal debate&lt;/a&gt;. There’s plenty of disagreement within both major US parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s rarely been clearer than it is this week which side is winning right now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SEC Modernizes the Accredited Investor Definition</title>
<link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-191</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-191</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Washington D.C., Aug. 26, 2020 —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;107.59375937594&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to the “accredited investor” definition, one of the principal tests for determining who is eligible to participate in our private capital markets.  Historically, individual investors who do not meet specific income or net worth tests, regardless of their financial sophistication, have been denied the opportunity to invest in our multifaceted and vast private markets.  The amendments update and improve the definition to more effectively identify institutional and individual investors that have the knowledge and expertise to participate in those markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s amendments are the product of years of effort by the Commission and its staff to consider and analyze approaches to revising the accredited investor definition,” said Chairman Jay Clayton.  “For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, clear measures of financial sophistication.  I am also pleased that we have expanded and updated the list of entities, including tribal governments and other organizations, that may qualify to participate in certain private offerings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments allow investors to qualify as accredited investors based on defined measures of professional knowledge, experience or certifications in addition to the existing tests for income or net worth.  The amendments also expand the list of entities that may qualify as accredited investors, including by allowing any entity that meets an investments test to qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* * *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT SHEET&lt;br/&gt;Updating the Accredited Investor Definitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aug. 26, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to update and improve the definition of “accredited investor” in the Commission’s rules and the definition of “qualified institutional buyer” in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.  The amendments to the accredited investor definition add new categories of qualifying natural persons and entities and make certain other modifications to the existing definition.  The amendments to the qualified institutional buyer definition similarly expand the list of eligible entities under that definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These amendments are part of the Commission’s ongoing effort to simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, the Commission requested public comment on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2019/33-10649.pdf&quot;&gt;Concept Release on Harmonization of Securities Offering Exemptions&lt;/a&gt;.  In the Concept Release, the Commission requested comments on possible approaches to amending the accredited investor definition, which is a central component of several exemptions from registration, including Rules 506(b) and 506(c) of Regulation D, and plays an important role in other federal and state securities law contexts.  The Concept Release was preceded by a Commission staff report issued in December 2015 on the accredited investor definition, which examined the background and history of the definition and considered comments and recommendations on amending the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking into account the views expressed by members of the public and recommendations over the years from various Commission advisory committees and the annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation, the Commission proposed in December 2019 to amend the accredited investor definition.  In March 2020, the Commission continued the harmonization effort by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/33-10763.pdf&quot;&gt;proposing amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the exempt offering framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments revise Rule 501(a), Rule 215, and Rule 144A of the Securities Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments to the accredited investor definition in Rule 501(a):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add a new category to the definition that permits natural persons to qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time by order.  In conjunction with the adoption of the amendments, the Commission designated by order holders in good standing of the Series 7, Series 65, and Series 82 licenses as qualifying natural persons.  This approach provides the Commission with flexibility to reevaluate or add certifications, designations, or credentials in the future.  Members of the public may wish to propose for the Commission’s consideration additional certifications, designations or credentials that satisfy the attributes set out in the new rule;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include as accredited investors, with respect to investments in a private fund, natural persons who are “knowledgeable employees” of the fund;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarify that limited liability companies with $5 million in assets may be accredited investors and add SEC- and state-registered investment advisers, exempt reporting advisers, and rural business investment companies (RBICs) to the list of entities that may qualify;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a new category for any entity, including Indian tribes, governmental bodies, funds, and entities organized under the laws of foreign countries, that own “investments,” as defined in Rule 2a51-1(b) under the Investment Company Act, in excess of $5 million and that was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the securities offered;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add “family offices” with at least $5 million in assets under management and their “family clients,” as each term is defined under the Investment Advisers Act; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the term “spousal equivalent” to the accredited investor definition, so that spousal equivalents may pool their finances for the purpose of qualifying as accredited investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment to Rule 215 replaces the existing definition with a cross reference to the definition in Rule 501(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments expand the definition of “qualified institutional buyer” in Rule 144A to include limited liability companies and RBICs if they meet the $100 million in securities owned and invested threshold in the definition.  The amendments also add to the list any institutional investors included in the accredited investor definition that are not otherwise enumerated in the definition of “qualified institutional buyer,” provided they satisfy the $100 million threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission also adopted conforming amendments to Rule 163B under the Securities Act and to Rule 15g-1 under the Exchange Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments and order become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is TDD Dead? (2014)</title>
<link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We answer questions from our viewers: what open-source examples of TDD exist, what changes would make us change our use of TDD, and how well it works for inexperienced developers. We finish by summing up our view of the health of TDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;143.53015754638&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin by saying we'll structure this hangout by picking and answering some questions submitted by viewers. &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;01m35s&quot;&gt;David starts by picking a question from Mike Harris, who asks for examples of open-source projects that have used TDD and either got test-induced design damage or used TDD well. David responds by saying there aren't good examples and this is one of the problems of debates like this.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;02m20s&quot;&gt;We don't have good application examples in general, because open-source contributors often work on private applications and open-source common frameworks and libraries.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;02m50s&quot;&gt;As a result we go into these discussions with different contexts,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;03m10s&quot;&gt;which often makes it look like there is more disagreement than there really is. People come together when you have real code rather than philosophical principles.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;03m50s&quot;&gt;The code examples we have are minor examples rather than things people are actually working on,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;04m10s&quot;&gt;so you have to understand people via presentations - which is why he used Jim Weirich's example for design damage. For good rails code he suggests Rails books that show standard testing approaches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;05m10s&quot;&gt;I comment that it takes lots of effort to understand real code. I do some some digging into our code bases but it takes a lot of time, and even then it's not the same understanding as you get by working with the team.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;06m50s&quot;&gt;Kent says that &lt;a href=&quot;http://junit.org/&quot;&gt;JUnit&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a project that used TDD strictly and turned out well.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;06m50s&quot;&gt;But it isn't a good example for this discussion because it has clear interfaces that make a sweet spot for TDD. We are talking here about different kinds of applications.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;08m25s&quot;&gt;If someone has a good example, they should write it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;08m45s&quot;&gt;David says my comments illustrate that we can't treat programming as a science - we can't evaluate techniques objectively.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;09m55s&quot;&gt;This doesn't mean it isn't worth debating. We can't get a definitive answer, it's your job to figure out what makes sense.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;10m25s&quot;&gt;Kent agrees we can't replicate experiments, but says we still can look at things personally with a scientific mindset. We can try things out empirically for ourselves, but you can't get universal answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;11m44s&quot;&gt;Kent picks the next question (asked by Graham Lee): what could change about the way we write software to make TDD redundent or obsolete for Kent and Martin and what could change about how TDD is performed to make it useful for David?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;12m30s&quot;&gt;Kent replied by saying his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/rip-tdd/750840194948847&quot;&gt;RIP TDD post&lt;/a&gt; points out his postion (if rather sarcastically). TDD solves several problems, starting with confidence.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;13m12s&quot;&gt;TDD also allows him to break problems down piecemeal, tackling specific cases without having to solve the general case all at once.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;15m30s&quot;&gt;He's not prepared to give up on TDD just because it's hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;15m50s&quot;&gt;I say that for me it's not about changes that would make TDD obsolete, rather the applicability of TDD in different contexts. I've experienced following TDD in a mechanical way with a calm &quot;rapid unhurriedness&quot; where I've blundered into good designs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;16m50s&quot;&gt;Most of my programming these days is my website toolchain and while I do piecemeal progress, and have a good regression test suite - I don't find TDD applicable. But when I built the infodeck code, there was a lot of application behavior where TDD was effective.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;18m20s&quot;&gt;&quot;Some contexts are very suitable for TDD, some contexts less so&quot;. And people bring their personality into that context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;18m45s&quot;&gt;David said his experience was similar. His introduction to testing was through TDD, he liked it and tried to apply it to everything but slowly realized that lots of areas in an MVC web application didn't feel good for TDD.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;20m20s&quot;&gt;This doesn't mean TDD isn't effective for some situations, just that those cases are a small percentage of his work.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;20m45s&quot;&gt;But abandoning TDD doesn't mean he wants to give up self-testing code - that's always been the value of TDD to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;22m25s&quot;&gt;I say that this is exactly how someone should take on TDD (or any technique). Try it out, overuse it, settle into a mode that works for you. Then also look a bit deeper: &quot;tdd is gateway drug to self-testing code&quot;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;23m30s&quot;&gt;Kent said he didn't mind where people end up with their workflow having done this kind of process. His experience of using TDD differs to David's. He finds there are moments in development where something is hard and he gets an idea of an object with a certain protocol that simplifies things.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;25m35s&quot;&gt;TDD gives him a mechanism to quickly get feedback on such an idea, trying and example usage of the API and implementing it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;27m00s&quot;&gt;He also finds cases where TDD doesn't fit. He then finds command-R is a good way of getting feedback,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;27m45s&quot;&gt;but he's hoping for the moment when he can see the simplifying object and try it out with TDD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;28m45s&quot;&gt;I pick the next question (from Tudor Pavel): how does TDD work with less experienced developers. I reply by saying that TDD forces people to do small pieces and helps them separate interface from implementation. It doesn't guarantee great results, because you can't do good design without experience.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;29m55s&quot;&gt;When less experienced people do TDD they typically don't refactor enough, leading to sub-optimal designs. You can't compare an inexperienced developer's output to an experienced developer's output, you have to compare it to what that indexperienced developer would have done without tdd. Although we can't measure this, it does seem to be advantageous, and creates a self-testing code base which is easier to improve later through refactoring. So TDD gives you a good start point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;31m50s&quot;&gt;David said that was the value he got from TDD. He started with TDD and found it was great training wheels, however he felt the discussion didn't move on enough since.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;34m00s&quot;&gt;He's skeptical when people say you must give simple, direct, bombastic advice to new people otherwise they won't do it. That shows a lack of confidence in what you're teaching.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;35m00s&quot;&gt;I agreed with that dislike for dogmatic statements. I get suspicious if I can't find arguments against something I'm describing. One twist, however, is that we do have to keep repeating introductory stuff for new people: some people resist repeating the basics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;36m35s&quot;&gt;David thinks this is why we're having this conversation now. As people describe TDD they add their own spin to the basics, after ten years of this you end up a long way down the road from where you started, and not in a good place.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;37m40s&quot;&gt;You need to hit the reset button, an approach that's crude but effective. When he says TDD is dead, he's referring to this current mutation - we have to get back to first principles.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;38m55s&quot;&gt;Kent said his gut reaction to David's original keynote was at that level. Programmers will often do the same thing many times, make things too complicated, and stick with dysfunctional systems at work. He's happy to reboot to first principles, but doesn't want to lose the evolution of people's expectations about programming in the last ten years. You should be able to feel confident, point to progress, have productive technical collaborations. He feels he can be his whole self at work now in a way that he couldn't be when he started his career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;41m30s&quot;&gt;David thinks that several things came together at the same time : TDD, XP, and Ruby. People laughed at the notion that programming should be fun, but he wanted to continue with that notion in developing Rails. Now he thinks that the Ruby world takes that happiness for granted - these things have won - as has agile.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;43m20s&quot;&gt;I disagree that agile has won - the label has won, but many people say they do agile but don't really. This is typical for things like this, a process I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html&quot;&gt;semantic diffusion&lt;/a&gt;. The big win is that now we are able to do agile openly at clients.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;45m30s&quot;&gt;David observes this reboot problem with other things - after ten years you get lots of cruft. He used the example of Pinkberry which started with just two flavors, but then got a complicated range of flavors just like other ice-creams -&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;46m10s&quot;&gt;&quot;most people can't leave good ideas the fuck alone.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;47m00s&quot;&gt;TDD and Agile are very broad tents now. People who say they are doing agile do opposite things.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;47m25s&quot;&gt;Kent says that he hasn't seen the things with TDD that David has. He always applies TDD from first principles in his work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;48m05s&quot;&gt;Kent appreciates that David has brought attention to TDD acquiring some barnacles and needs some scraping.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;49m00s&quot;&gt;David said he's seen similar issues with Rails. He uses Rails in its basic form and is shocked by some Rails usage he's seen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;50m40s&quot;&gt;Kent remembers the first OOPSLA when XP got attention, Jim Rumbaugh said you won't recognize what happens to XP in ten years and he was right.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;51m30s&quot;&gt;I said that this is what success looks like, the alternative is that things don't take off. It's always hard to tell if something bad happens due to something inherent in a technique or due to misuse of a technique. All we can do is keep repeating the basics and the good lessons.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;52m50s&quot;&gt;David agreed: &quot;you either die a hero or become the villan.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;53m10s&quot;&gt;Ruby was a reboot of good ideas about programming. Functional Programming is another reboot. These reboots are healthy.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;54m10s&quot;&gt;He's impressed by how long Rails and TDD have lasted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;54m50s&quot;&gt;Before Rails he worked with PHP. You can write good code with PHP if you use it well, he feels that other languages do a better job of encouraging good usage. He things that using TDD well in an MVC web app is harder than writing clean PHP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;56m30s&quot;&gt;Kent hasn't found that - any time he can break off a piece of a problem into a useful abstraction he can use TDD.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;57m20s&quot;&gt;He wants to explore other avenues to these big goals of bringing his whole self to programming. He will continue to explore this with experiments: doing it too much, not enough, finding the golidlocks zone, and understanding why.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;59m05s&quot;&gt;He comes out firmly contradicting David: TDD isn't dead, but is glad David set fire to it so it could come out like a phoenix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;59m40s&quot;&gt;David said he started this discussion because people wouldn't talk about cases where TDD wasn't effective. They weren't feeling good or confident, but were told they must use TDD. He wants to open the sphere of acceptable reactions so we can discuss when TDD is and isn't appropriate.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;1h3m&quot;&gt;Lots of people on the internet talk about how good TDD is, but people were afraid to say it wasn't working for them. For David the baby is self-testing code, we don't want to lose that when questioning TDD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;1h5m&quot;&gt;I concluded by saying that (as I suspected before we started) there is lots we agree on. We all value self-testing code a lot, we all agree TDD is valuable in some contexts, we might disagree on how many contexts (although it's hard to really tell).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;clip&quot; title=&quot;1h5m50s&quot;&gt;Everything still boils down to the point that if you're involved in software development you have to be thoughtful about it, you have to build up what practices work for you and your team, you can't take any technique blindly. You need to try it, use it, overuse it, and find what works for you and your team. We're not in a codified science, so we have to work with our own experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US indictments of piracy group members throw top-tier piracy world into chaos</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/us-indictments-and-raids-of-piracy-group-members-in-the-scene-throw-top-tier-piracy-world-into-chaos-200826/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/us-indictments-and-raids-of-piracy-group-members-in-the-scene-throw-top-tier-piracy-world-into-chaos-200826/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-fire-burn.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;/&gt;Yesterday morning, TorrentFreak began receiving reports from multiple sources that something big was happening in the shadowy world of top-tier piracy known as ‘The Scene’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the volumes of information received, the majority of sources indicated that many so-called ‘topsites’ and their members had disappeared or gone into hiding. The word was that several major movie release groups – SPARKS, GECKOS and DRONES – had been targeted in a series of raids and as a result, people were running for cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely where these raids or actions took place still isn’t entirely clear. Multiple sources point to the Nordic region, particularly Norway and Sweden, but reports of disruption and/or action in the Netherlands and even Switzerland persisted across our confidential sources, all of whom demand anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, one name kept cropping up – ‘Artist’ – someone who was identified by at least two individuals with inside knowledge as a central figure, not only in The Scene but also in the action that appeared to unfold yesterday. The reality, it now transpires, is that the events of Tuesday had their roots in an investigation that started months – maybe even years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US Govt Legal Action Launched in January 2020 – George Bridi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 8, 2020, an indictment in the case United States v. BRIDI was filed and sealed in a New York district court. Yesterday, as the action in Europe was unfolding, Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman ordered the indictment to be unsealed, shining significant light on the events of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment and Grand Jury charges target George Bridi, a British national who, according to the US Government, resided in the Isle of Wight, a small island off the south coast of England. Bridi is identified, along with others “known and unknown”, as a member of a criminal conspiracy, aka release group SPARKS and its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His Scene nickname, if he has one, is not listed in the available documents. Nevertheless, the US Government claims to know much about his activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The primary objective of the Sparks Group was to fraudulently obtain DVDs and Blu-Ray discs for copyrighted movies and television shows prior to their retail release date, compromise the copyright protections on the discs, reproduce and upload the copyrighted content to servers controlled by the Sparks Group, and disseminate the copyrighted content on the Internet for public consumption before the DVDs and Blu-Ray discs were made available for sale by retailers to the public,” Bridi’s indictment reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘conspiracy’, at least in the case of Bridi, was alleged to taken place from around 2011 until January 2020. It’s claimed that members of SPARKS made various “material misrepresentations and omissions” to wholesale distributors in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey in order to obtain copies of DVDs and Blu-Ray discs prior to their official release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment indicates that Bridi was also involved in obtaining and reproducing TV show content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once obtained, members of SPARKS allegedly used specialist software to “rip” the discs in order to remove their copyright protections and then encoded the content into a format easily consumed via the Internet. This content was then uploaded to servers controlled by SPARKS members, from where it’s alleged other members further distributed the content to streaming sites, torrent networks and other servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the information received yesterday by TF indicating that SPARKS, GECKOS and DRONES were central to Tuesday’s turmoil, the indictment adds two other release groups to the list – ROVERS and SPRINTER – both claimed to be part of the ‘Sparks Conspiracy’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridi is charged with conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Superseding Indictment – Umar Ahmad, aka ‘Artist’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to information received early yesterday by TF, with multiple sources referencing someone called ‘Artist’ involved in a central role, unsealed court documents now put more flesh on the bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identified by the US Government as Oslo, Norway, resident ‘Umar Ahmad’, it’s alleged that from around 2011 up to January 2020, ‘Artist’ was also a member of the ‘Sparks Conspiracy’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with Bridi, he is alleged to have caused “tens of millions of dollars” in losses to film production studios by being part of the SPARKS group that obtained physical discs from wholesale distribution companies, ripped and encoded them, and placed the content on the Internet for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Bridi, he faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement but charges of wire fraud and transporting stolen property are absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Superseding Indictment – Jonatan Correa, aka ‘Raid’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Bridi and Ahmad, it’s alleged that Correa was involved in the ‘Sparks Conspiracy’ from around 2011 but his involvement is said to have stretched beyond the January 2020 dates listed in their Grand Jury charges by several months, to August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons that aren’t yet entirely clear, he appears to have carried on his alleged criminal activity until this month, unlike his peers who are only charged with offenses up to the first month of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correa’s charges read very much like Bridi’s and Ahmad’s, in that he stands accused of being part of the ‘Sparks Conspiracy’ that unlawfully obtained, ripped, encoded and uploaded video content to the Internet, including to various servers, streaming and torrent sites, all in advance of their official street date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On numerous occasions between in or around 2011 and in or around May 2020 , a co-conspirator not named herein fraudulently arranged for discs containing copyrighted films and television shows to be picked up, mailed, or delivered from distributors located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, New Jersey, and British Columbia, Canada to other members of the Sparks Group, including JONATAN CORREA, a/k/a ‘Raid,’ the defendant, prior to their official release date…,” Correa’s indictment reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s further alleged that around 2011 and in or around May 2020, Correa “remotely accessed” a computer located in Westchester County and belonging to another unnamed co-conspirator, in order to “illegally record and reproduce” copyrighted TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bridi and Ahmad’s locations are revealed in court documents, Correa’s currently remains unknown. Like Bridi, he faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement but in common with Ahmad, charges of wire fraud and transporting stolen property are absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Reports and Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak is currently liaising with a number of sources who for security reasons are demanding anonymity. However, it appears that the information detailed thus far is just the tip of a large iceberg that has much of The Scene in turmoil and/or in hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can say at this point is that the mention of Umar Ahmad, aka ‘Artist’, is causing considerable concern because of his alleged reach in The Scene that seems to go well beyond SPARKS and its affiliated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on this in a follow-up report but in the meantime the US court documents can be found here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/1-20-cr-00018-US-v-George-Bridi-SPARKS-indictment-unsealed-200108.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/1-20-cr-00018-US-v-Umar-Ahmad-SPARKS-superceding-indictment-unsealed1-200825.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/1-20-cr-00018-US-v-Jonatan-Correa-SPARKS-superceding-indictment-unsealed-200825.pdf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; pdf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The US Department of Justice has just revealed some additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridi, 50, was arrested on Sunday in Cyprus on an INTERPOL Red Notice. Correa, 36, was arrested yesterday in Olathe, Kansas, where he will appear in federal court. Ahmad, 39, was not arrested and is still at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In coordination with law enforcement authorities in 18 other countries and supported by Eurojust and Europol, dozens of servers controlled by the Sparks Group were taken offline today around the world, including in North America, Europe, and Asia. The Sparks Group utilized these servers to illegally store and disseminate copyrighted content to members around the globe,” the statement adds.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;SMITHSONIANMAG.COM&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class=&quot;pub-date&quot; data-pubdate=&quot;Aug. 24, 2020, 2:10 p.m.&quot;&gt;Aug. 24, 2020, 2:10 p.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;437.1212323835&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1963, a saucer-shaped, yellow submarine returned from the depths of the Red Sea and docked to an underwater research center, 26 miles off the coast of Port Sudan and 33 feet below the surface. Aboard it was legendary explorer and oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, who captured the imagination of millions with his Oscar-winning documentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://naturedocumentaries.org/949/world-without-sun-jacques-cousteau/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;World Without Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;This is the first time an undersea boat has had an undersea base,&quot; Cousteau narrated as his slender figure climbed out of the submarine and into Continental Shelf Station Two, the underwater station that served as home and laboratory to five aquanauts for one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Conshelf Two—a starfish-shaped habitat with bunk beds and infrared lamps as heaters—Cousteau proved that human beings can live under the sea for long periods of time. With its four rooms branching out from the center, it was a significant improvement from Conshelf One—a 16-foot long, 8-foot wide steel cylinder that could only fit two people. Funded by the French petrochemical industry, Cousteau’s Conshelf mission was halted just two years later, after Conshelf Three was set up at a record depth of 330 feet, and Cousteau shifted his focus from petrol-funded research to ocean conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;filer-image-align-left lazy&quot; alt=&quot;le monde sans soleil.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/-zqihcZ5YQoyb1yniFgnWsSTMEM=/fit-in/600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/1b/46/1b46e70d-793f-48c1-9241-c38975a98461/le_monde_sans_soleil.jpg&quot;/&gt; Legendary explorer and oceanographer Jacques Cousteau captured the imagination of millions with his Oscar-winning documentary &lt;em&gt;World Without Sun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(The Cousteau Society)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;filer-image-align-right lazy&quot; alt=&quot;yellowsubmarine.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/DesXIfqMryK6IIfhWktA5oQ2fSM=/fit-in/600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/24/e7/24e7015e-81fa-46d7-a090-92e8ce115348/yellowsubmarine.jpg&quot;/&gt; Jacques Cousteau's Yellow Submarine &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(The Cousteau Society)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much like the slew of single-mission habitats that followed Conshelf, not much remains of these underwater innovations. Plagued, in part, by a shift in public interest that triggered greater funding for space exploration, some have been pulled out of the water, others have become diving sites encrusted with coral growth. Today, the only operating underwater habitat remaining is 34 years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cousteau's grandson, Fabien, is hoping to change that. The founder of the Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting and preserving the planet’s oceans, coastal areas and marine habitats, is building the world’s largest underwater research station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;filer-image-align-right lazy&quot; alt=&quot;fabien-cousteau-fl_1970529c (1).jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/HeWQlS7CK-ur2vGyGMKhzTiXTTM=/fit-in/600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/34/ec/34ece35b-bbe3-4990-994e-f7107de06924/fabien-cousteau-fl_1970529c_1.jpg&quot;/&gt; Fabien Cousteau with his grandfather Jacques Cousteau &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Courtesy of Fabien Cousteau)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;filer-image-align-left lazy&quot; alt=&quot;fabien-cousteau_photo-headshot_by Carrie Vonderhaar.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/WybVQZnvQ5H7F3VXzkI3wQ6ph84=/fit-in/600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/7e/6f/7e6f7f51-9d4e-49ce-80f3-7325087b677e/fabien-cousteau_photo-headshot_by_carrie_vonderhaar.jpg&quot;/&gt; Fabien Cousteau &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Carrie Vonderhaar)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named after the prophetic sea-god Proteus, the station will be located at a depth of 60 feet, in a biodiverse, Marine Protected Area off the coast of Curaçao. Imagined as the underwater version of the International Space Station, it will be the first underwater research habitat built in decades, marking a new chapter in their tumultuous history. “We're now in a new evolution of consciousness of ocean exploration,” says Fabien. “Thanks to modern technology, we're able to communicate the importance of ocean exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabien learned to scuba dive when he was four. An oceanographic explorer, environmental advocate and aquanaut (he was trained to live and work underwater), he explains that one of his biggest frustrations is the significant limitations of scuba diving as a research tool for ocean scientists. When scuba diving from the surface, the amount of time safely spent in deeper waters is limited to an average of two hours per day. With Proteus, he says, &quot;Now, all of a sudden, we have a house at the bottom of the sea, and we're able to go into the water, and dive 10 to 12 hours a day to do research, science and filming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer and pioneer in testing the viability of underwater habitats, sees promise in Fabien’s vision. “Proteus is a hopeful step forward in spreading the message that we must protect the ocean as if our lives depend on it,” she says. “Living underwater gives us the gift of time and the incredible perspective of being a resident on the reef. You’re not just a visitor anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Fabien spent 31 days in the Aquarius Reef Base, the last remaining research station. Built in 1986, the 400-square foot base sits on the seabed off Key Largo in the Florida Keys. There, he experienced the challenges of living underwater firsthand: high humidity levels, low light, no fresh food, no physical exercise and extreme isolation. &quot;I wanted to address all the shortcomings and offer something that is much more conducive to future exploration and research by taking as many elements from the topside world and bringing it down to a state-of-the-art marine research center,&quot; he says. &quot;This requires a different layout.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With very few exceptions, previous underwater laboratories (there have been over 65) have been cylinders, segmented into smaller areas for living and working. Proteus, which was designed by industrial designer Yves Béhar and his firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fuseproject.com/&quot;&gt;fuseproject&lt;/a&gt;, is unlike any other habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center had been holding workshops and symposiums with academics, corporations and engineers to validate the scientific need for Proteus for two years when Fabien was introduced to Béhar in 2018. The two met at Helena, an organization that brings global leaders together to discuss and implement solutions to global issues. Last month, Béhar unveiled his design for Proteus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Proteus_Full View_logo.png&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/WoG_8X8Dpv4tME4JfLkZpDrQBP4=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/11/75/11750f1b-ba7f-40c9-b94c-d3f49ee4b47a/proteus_full_view_logo.png&quot;/&gt; Named after the prophetic sea-god Proteus, the station will be located at a depth of 60 feet, in a biodiverse, Marine Protected Area off the coast of Curaçao. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Concept designs by Yves Béhar and fuseproject)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 4,000 square feet, Proteus will be ten times the size of the Aquarius Reef Base. Circular in shape, the two-story structure will revolve around a central curving ramp that connects the two floors. &quot;You're living under tremendous amount of pressure, literal, but also scientific pressure,&quot; says Béhar. To mitigate that, he has envisioned a social space at the center, surrounded by various extensions housed in pods, where the living quarters, research laboratories, medical bays and bathrooms will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60 feet below the surface, natural light is another challenge, reduced to half the visible spectrum. The circular floors will therefore be offset from each other, with porthole windows and skylights allowing as much natural light as possible. Inside, full spectrum lights will fulfill the human need for a minimum of ten minutes of UV rays a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate ocean exploration, the structure will also include a moon pool, or as Jacques Cousteau once called it—&quot;a liquid door.&quot; This specially engineered opening, situated at the bottom of the habitat, will allow divers to exit through a pressurized chamber. Unlike a space station or a submarine, the air pressure inside underwater structures is kept equal to the water pressure outside, preventing seawater from entering the habitat. This allows aquanauts to easily slip out and conduct underwater research using saturation diving—a technique that reduces the risk of decompression sickness. After 24 hours at any depth, the human body becomes saturated with nitrogen and aquanauts can remain in underwater habitats for an indefinite amount of time. (Bruce Cantrell and Jessica Fain hold the current record: 73 days in Jules’ Undersea Lodge, a former research habitat turned underwater hotel). When they are ready to resurface, the time required for decompression is the same no matter the length of the stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Proteus_Backside angle view_logo.png&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/GcUV-pYuZcL44fuUHgBMh0nDvvk=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/4a/87/4a873f70-1424-4b0d-b147-af7d619d0ae1/proteus_backside_angle_view_logo.png&quot;/&gt; Circular in shape, the two-story structure will revolve around a central curving ramp that connects the two floors. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Concept designs by Yves Béhar and fuseproject)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteus is still in the concept phase. Fabien is raising $135 million to build the habitat and operate it for the first three years. Yet Béhar and Fabien have already discussed using composite building technology for the hull and 3D-printed coral tiles—which Fabien’s foundation has used to regenerate sea reefs—to create a living reef on the structure. And when the time comes to build, “there's no way to bring a structure underwater without sinking it,” says Béhar. “You need to fill the structure with water, sink it, and attach it to bottom of the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the design of Proteus, Béhar looked at the way science fiction portrayed underwater habitats, but history was his strongest muse. &quot;Jules Verne's book, watching Cousteau's underwater adventures, were a key part of my imagination,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1872, Verne popularized the idea of underwater life with his epic novel &lt;em&gt;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt;. Six decades later, American scientist William Beebe and engineer Otis Barton made science fiction a reality. In the 1930s, the pair collaborated on experimental submersibles called bathyspheres. These tiny, pressurized capsules, which dangled from a ship, took the duo more than 3,000 feet down off the coast of Bermuda, and kickstarted a surge of deep-sea exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auguste Piccard took deep-sea submarine development to the next level. The Swiss physicist and inventor, who had risen to record heights in the pressurized capsule of a balloon, realized that airships and underwater vehicles weren't so different after all. Instead of using a cable to lower and raise his submarine, Piccard used detachable ballast weights and a buoyancy tank filled with petrol, akin to the helium-filled envelope of an airship. In 1960, his invention took Piccard and American oceanographer Don Walsh on a journey to the deepest known point of the Earth—35,814 feet into the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these pioneers, humans had visited the deep sea, but the advances prompted a new question: Could we live in it, too? Jacques Cousteau, the inventor of scuba, the diving regulator and an underwater vehicle known as the “diving saucer,” sparked a public fascination for the ocean (and from there, underwater living) with his documentaries about life onboard his research ship, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cousteau.org/legacy/vessels/calypso/&quot;&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;When I was a kid, Calypso was a home away from home,&quot; says Fabien. &quot;It was an amazing classroom. It made me realize these pioneers are pushing the limits every day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Conshelf II.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/kr18y1ntjMSFPL8F_0wAIGhknck=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/39/fc/39fc9677-4cc1-4feb-9a05-5be06ba78af8/conshelf_ii.jpg&quot;/&gt; Conshelf Two was a starfish-shaped underwater “village” built in 1963. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Didier Brandelet/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And push the limits they did. In 1962, Cousteau built Conshelf One—a steel, drum-shaped structure the size of a shipping container that was suspended 33 feet underwater off the coast of Marseilles. Together with George F. Bond, the father of saturation diving, Cousteau went on to build two more underwater stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conshelf Two was the starfish-shaped underwater “village” that served as backdrop for &lt;em&gt;World Without Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Built in 1963, it was sited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diveglobal.com/divesite/shaab-rumi-south/&quot;&gt;Sha’ab Rumi&lt;/a&gt;—where Cousteau’s coral-encrusted shark cages have created a diving mecca—while a smaller and deeper cabin housed two aquanauts for a week at 100 feet. Two years later, Conshelf Three was born. Resembling a black-and-yellow checkered disco ball, the station provided six divers, including Cousteau’s son Philippe, a self-sufficient environment, 330 feet under the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;conshelf III.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/25Aqe9b91TLci1yCWxaD3jJhW7Y=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/f3/9e/f39e464f-1575-4554-9b34-b59afa9ed7e9/conshelf_iii.jpg&quot;/&gt; Resembling a black-and-yellow checkered disco ball, Conshelf III provided six divers a self-sufficient environment 330 feet under the Mediterranean sea. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(The Cousteau Society)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conshelf stations triggered a wave of underwater building. From the Baltic to the Gulf of Mexico, single-mission undersea habitats sprouted like mushrooms. Between 1964 and 1969, the U.S. Navy’s SeaLab I, II and III descended to greater and greater depths—193 feet, 203 feet and 600 feet respectively—until the tragic death of an aquanaut put an end to Sealab III. In 1968, Helgoland—built by German company Dräger—became the first underwater laboratory built for cold waters and rough sea conditions (it was used in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and in the Gulf of Maine). And in 1969 and 1970, NASA teamed up with the Navy and the Department of the Interior to launch Tektite I and II—the first nationally sponsored scientists-in-the-sea program. Deployed to a depth of 50 feet in the U.S. Virgin Islands’ Great Lameshur Bay, and built by General Electric, the Tektite habitat was made up of two, 20-foot tall silos connected by a watertight tunnel and dotted with dome-shaped windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;NEEMO.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/amp9a-PuM3ncdyBmYcAORJ1LeA0=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/44/0b/440b9ee6-7455-46fb-9bba-eaaa8ef04923/neemo.jpg&quot;/&gt; The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 21 mission began on July 21, 2016, as an international crew of aquanauts splashed down to the undersea Aquarius Reef Base, 62 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(NASA)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tektite was eventually pulled from the water, but NASA’s interest in underwater structures continues to this day. Designed to simulate life onboard the ISS and test new concepts for future interplanetary missions, NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) sends groups of astronauts, engineers and scientists to live in Key Largo’s Aquarius Reef Base. In this extreme environment, where mobility is limited to a confined space and water provides a near-zero gravity experience, astronauts are afforded a convincing analog for space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the peak of deep-sea exploration, Fabien estimates there were 20 truly habitable underwater structures. Today, Aquarius remains the only operating underwater research station in the world—a proud survivor that has lasted 34 years when it was built to last five. &quot;After the '70s, ocean exploration hasn't evolved in a way that space exploration has,&quot; says Fabien. With Proteus, he hopes to shift public interest back to the ocean—and he isn’t the only one looking to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;SeaOrbiter-1©J. Rougerie Architectes Associes.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/GnBsip_0ykw-5A3sHNwlKHx4jw0=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/24/c7/24c70b3a-a795-4449-861c-3e92ce690ccd/seaorbiter-1j_rougerie_architectes_associes.jpg&quot;/&gt; Built to sail the oceans, the SeaOrbiter was designed—after a seahorse—to float vertically and drift with the ocean currents. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Rougerie Architectes Associes)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French architect &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rougerie.com/&quot;&gt;Jacques Rougerie&lt;/a&gt; has devoted his entire career to building underwater structures, citing Jacques Cousteau as the impetus for his pursuit of architecture and oceanography. Since 2009, his foundation has hosted annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fondation-jacques-rougerie.com/competition&quot;&gt;competitions&lt;/a&gt; for young architects to design underwater and space habitats. Rougerie believes that our future lies with the blue economy, or what the World Bank defines as the “sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem.” But first, he says, we need a blue society. “We must motivate the young generation,” he says. “We have to instill this passion in them. They have to feel involved.” To do this, we need supporting platforms, “strong symbols” like Proteus, or his very own proposal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seaorbiter.com/&quot;&gt;SeaOrbiter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rougerie has designed dozens of underwater habitats, four of which have been built. His very first was &lt;a href=&quot;https://architizer.com/projects/galathee/&quot;&gt;Galathée&lt;/a&gt;, a 56-ton, semi-mobile habitat launched in 1977, off the coast of Japan. Until Galathée, the architect explains, most previous structures were built on the seabed. Rougerie changed the course by designing a structure with a variable ballast that allows suspended anchoring at different depths (from 30 to 200 feet) and with no impact on the underwater ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Galathee-1©J. Rougerie Architectes Associes.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/m18lQjub18TmwEGr2bYOsoGZx_c=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/7e/e7/7ee774e3-fa6c-4e65-8b69-fd0dbb00ce70/galathee-1j_rougerie_architectes_associes.jpg&quot;/&gt; Galathée was a 56-ton, semi-mobile habitat launched in 1977 off the coast of Japan. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Rougerie Architectes Associes)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His later habitats were even more mobile, culminating in his most ambitious design to date—SeaOrbiter. Built to sail the oceans, the semi-submersible vessel was designed—after a seahorse—to float vertically and drift with the ocean currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sea is an incredible source. A field of hope for startups around the world,” Rougerie says. “We still don’t know about the abyssal zone [the deepest layer of the ocean near the sea floor]. We don’t know about the hydrothermal vents. We know very little.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/exploration.html&quot;&gt;National Ocean Service&lt;/a&gt;, more than 80 percent of our ocean remains &quot;unmapped, unobserved and unexplored.&quot; But even the parts that have been explored haven’t been mapped to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/just-how-little-do-we-know-about-the-ocean-floor/&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; high enough to detect objects such as airplane wreckage or the spire of an undersea volcano. With Proteus, Fabien will be able to map the surrounding area to a radius of a mile and a resolution of ¼ inch. &quot;That gives us a really, really neat mosaic that we can revisit on a regular basis to show the changes on a yearly and decade-long basis,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabien envisions the station to cater to a wide variety of studies, from biochemistry to pharmaceuticals to climate change. “Studying the historical responses of ecosystems like coral reefs to past changes in climate provides a useful guide. But these methods only get us so far,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/brian-helmuth/&quot;&gt;Brian Helmuth&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of marine and environmental sciences and public policy at Northeastern University. “Using a combination of experimental approaches coupled with observations in nature, we can use an understanding of the mechanisms by which reefs are impacted by environmental change to forecast future responses with much finer detail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Proteus, Helmuth sees an opportunity to study an intact coral reef over a prolonged period of time and without the limitations of surface diving. “It would allow scientists to study the undersea environment by becoming a part of it, rather than working as casual interlopers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famously, Fabien’s month-long mission in Aquarius Reef Base yielded three years’ worth of research, but there were shortcomings, like the lack of an on-site laboratory for real-time studies. The state-of-the-art laboratories on Proteus will allow for advanced research on-site, with no degradation of samples in transit, while its full-scale video production facility will provide continuous livestreaming for educational purposes. “There are countless teachers and students who, like me growing up in New York, don’t have easy access to the ocean,” says Helmuth. “Proteus really will be a game changer in ocean education, providing an inner space station that not only offers exciting new opportunities to the scientific community, but also reinvigorates that passion for the ocean that launched so many people from my generation into careers in science and exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of modern ocean exploration, the ocean has changed drastically. Vast swaths are now completely devoid of oxygen, leading to “dead zones” that are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/eaam7240&quot;&gt;four times larger&lt;/a&gt; than they were in 1950. &quot;When I was a teenager, I would go to the Florida Keys, and it was a playground of color, texture and movement,” says Fabien. “And now, comparatively, it's a ghost town.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwater habitats like Proteus, or SeaOrbiter, can help deepen our culture of exploration and experimentation. These undersea laboratories can help discover new species, understand how climate change affects the ocean, and allow for testing of green power, aquaculture and robotic exploration. &quot;The concept of robot-human teams is especially compelling for Proteus,“ says Mark Patterson, a professor and associate dean at Northeastern University, whose research focuses on the development of autonomous underwater robots for civil infrastructure and marine sensing. “This approach, of humans working with fast-swimming, tough robots, will overcome the problem that has plagued oceanography since the days of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/hms-challenger-humanitys-first-real-glimpse-of-the-deep-oceans&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMS Challenger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; expedition: namely, the ocean changes faster than we have had the ability to observe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty years after Cousteau filmed his adventures into the Red Sea, ocean exploration has yet to reach its full potential. “We have lived in the bosom of the sea,” Cousteau said as his yellow diving saucer rose from the darkness. “The sea has indulged us, but we have taken only the first steps into our new space. Further adventures await oceanauts in the world without sun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
