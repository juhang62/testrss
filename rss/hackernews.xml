<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenhouse keeps home in the 60’s, even when it’s freezing outside; allows family to grow Mediterranean fruit in Sweden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7969 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img-300x180.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img-300x180.jpg 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img-768x461.jpg 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img-1024x614.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-7948&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie Granmar and Charles Sacilotto literally live in a bubble, insulated from the cold and the harshness of the elements, while taking in the best of what nature has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their house is built inside of a greenhouse, providing them free heat and free food in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7964 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53595373_395632874348663_8005023616095748096_n-300x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53595373_395632874348663_8005023616095748096_n-300x169.png 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53595373_395632874348663_8005023616095748096_n-768x432.png 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53595373_395632874348663_8005023616095748096_n-1024x576.png 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53595373_395632874348663_8005023616095748096_n.png 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stockholm, Sweden, where winter lasts 9 months out of the year, that’s a huge asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average temperature in Stockholm in January is below freezing. But step into Marie and Charles’ bubbled-in “backyard,” and you’ll be much warmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7961 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53046681_788011761582393_2143229762066186240_n-300x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53046681_788011761582393_2143229762066186240_n-300x169.png 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53046681_788011761582393_2143229762066186240_n-768x432.png 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53046681_788011761582393_2143229762066186240_n-1024x576.png 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53046681_788011761582393_2143229762066186240_n.png 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For example at the end of January it can be 28°F outside and it can be 68°F upstairs,”  says in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/30ghnDOFbNQ&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal family in Stockholm switches on their heater on sometime around mid-September, and doesn’t turn it off again until mid-May or so, Marie says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greenhouse allows them to reduce the number of months they need to heat their home from 9 to 6 months per year, and reduces the amount of energy they use doing so. Any supplemental heat they need, that is not provided by the sun, is provided by a wood-burning stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie says she is more or less immune to the winter blues many of her friends experience during cold weather. Rain or snow, she can sit out on her balcony or her roof-top terrace and gaze at the stars, or any glimpses of sun she can catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7959 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/52966874_1199977286837309_3602706696318746624_n-300x169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/52966874_1199977286837309_3602706696318746624_n-300x169.jpg 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/52966874_1199977286837309_3602706696318746624_n-768x432.jpg 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/52966874_1199977286837309_3602706696318746624_n-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/52966874_1199977286837309_3602706696318746624_n.jpg 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, during the warmest parts of the summer, her glass roof automatically opens up when it hits a certain temperature, to let the heat out so it doesn’t get too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can get warm a few days in the summer,” she says, “but that’s not really a problem because we open the windows and we enjoy the heat. We like the sun!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family’s favorite hangout is the rooftop deck. Since they built a glass ceiling, they no longer needed a roof, so they removed it to create a large space for sunbathing, reading, gardening or playing with their son on swings and bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7968 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53138989_392679704849352_489210523204714496_n-300x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53138989_392679704849352_489210523204714496_n-300x169.png 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53138989_392679704849352_489210523204714496_n-768x432.png 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53138989_392679704849352_489210523204714496_n-1024x576.png 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53138989_392679704849352_489210523204714496_n.png 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to keeping their bodies warmer, the greenhouse also keeps their plants warmer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footprint of the greenhouse is nearly double that of the home, leaving plenty of room for a wrap-around garden. And since they’ve created a Mediterranean climate for themselves, the couple grows produce that typically isn’t grown in Sweden, like figs, grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs. Outside the glass they have cherry and apple trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7963 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53439736_1043039315889189_6319268567531388928_n-300x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53439736_1043039315889189_6319268567531388928_n-300x169.png 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53439736_1043039315889189_6319268567531388928_n-768x432.png 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53439736_1043039315889189_6319268567531388928_n-1024x576.png 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53439736_1043039315889189_6319268567531388928_n.png 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growing things here is not easy,” Marie says in the video. “We need all the extra energy we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of free heat, the couple has also installed a rainwater collection system for free water, and a composting toilet system that provides free fertilizer for their plants. Also, the plants that thrive in their home return the favor by cleaning the air and providing more oxygen. &lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7962 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53226285_856889874652072_5802131900680110080_n-300x169.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;527&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53226285_856889874652072_5802131900680110080_n-300x169.png 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53226285_856889874652072_5802131900680110080_n-768x432.png 768w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53226285_856889874652072_5802131900680110080_n-1024x576.png 1024w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/53226285_856889874652072_5802131900680110080_n.png 1334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a urine-separating toilet and uses centrifuges, cisterns, ponds and garden beds to filter waste water and compost the remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the future, the couple is working on designing a system to capture excess solar energy during the summer and store it for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to be self sufficient, and not dependent on bigger systems, you can have this and live anywhere you like,” Marie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all a philosophy of life, to use nature, sun and water to live in a another world,” Charles said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles and Marie weren’t the first ones to build a house-inside-a-greenhouse. Their idea was inspired by Swedish architect &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bengtwarne.malwa.nu/index.html&quot;&gt;Bengt Warne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; who built the first “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bengtwarne.malwa.nu/natureH.html&quot;&gt;Naturhus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” (Nature House) in Stockholm in 1974:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7967 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/natVaxt-300x201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;395&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; srcset=&quot;https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/natVaxt-300x201.jpg 300w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/natVaxt-75x50.jpg 75w, https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/natVaxt.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then a handful of others have been built in Sweden and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hedge funds use satellite images to beat Wall Street</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berkeley Haas research finds there may be a dark side to the rise of “alternative data” in capital markets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9050 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of a satellite orbiting the earth&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; srcset=&quot;http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research.jpg 750w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research-200x133.jpg 200w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research-300x200.jpg 300w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research-522x348.jpg 522w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Satellite_Panos-Patatoukas-research-600x400.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Assoc. Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/patatoukas-panos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Panos Patatoukas&lt;/a&gt; was discussing Walmart in his Financial Information Analysis course last year, a student brought up the story of how company founder Sam Walton used to count cars in store parking lots to gauge how sales were going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patatoukas knew that sophisticated investors had begun doing exactly that on a large-scale basis by analyzing satellite images of retailers’ parking lots, and he began to wonder just how much of an edge it was giving them. So he called up the company that pioneered satellite-image car counting and pitched the CEO on the idea of letting an academic analyze the data. With the help of funding from the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fcba.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Fisher Center for Business Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, he landed 4.8 million images of parking lots at 67,000 individual stores across the U.S. owned by 44 major retailers, including Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9051&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9051&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9051&quot; src=&quot;http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Berkeley Haas Assoc. Prof. Panos N. Patatoukas&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; srcset=&quot;http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas.jpg 300w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas-143x200.jpg 143w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas-214x300.jpg 214w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas-249x348.jpg 249w, http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Panos-N.-Patatoukas-286x400.jpg 286w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-9051&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berkeley Haas Assoc. Prof. Panos Patatoukas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting analysis by Patatoukas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/katona-zsolt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Assoc. Prof. Zsolt Katona&lt;/a&gt;—the first to quantify in detail the advantages of trading based on satellite imagery of parking lot traffic—found that the strategy can indeed deliver a significant boost for investors savvy enough to exploit it. Traders can accurately anticipate earnings news based on parking lot volume and earn significantly more than a typical benchmark return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The informational advantage yields 4% to 5% in the three days around quarterly earnings announcements, which is a significant return over such short window,” Patatoukas says. “If you annualize it, the number is staggering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that although this type of satellite data has been commercially available since 2011, the information hasn’t spread beyond a select few large investors, mostly hedge funds. That’s led to a consistently profitable strategy for hedge funds at the expense of individual investors, Patatoukas says: In particular, investors with access to satellite imagery data can get ahead of the rest of the market and target retailers with bad news for the quarter. This investment edge allows them to bet against those retailers by short selling their stock, even as individual investors are still buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we found is that it’s a gain for large sophisticated investors who can afford the substantial costs of acquiring and processing big alternative data at the expense of Main Street investors,” Patatoukas said. “If it was just a transfer of wealth between hedge funds, that would be a different story, but it’s small individual investors who tend to be on the other side of the trade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3222741&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;working paper&lt;/a&gt;—co-authored by Marcus Painter at the University of Kentucky and Berkeley Haas doctoral student Jieyin Zeng—raises questions about individual investor protections in an age of new “alternative data” sources. Even as technology has made trading more accessible to the masses, the rise of big data is creating so-called alternative data that only those with superior resources are tapping into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “dark side” of big data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled investors have always competed for an information edge that allows them to outperform the market by even fractions of a percentage point—that’s how Wall Street operates. Until recently, however, those traders had access to the same reports, earnings calls, SEC filings, and other public sources of information as everyone else. Trading on material non-public information, after all, is against the law, and the SEC makes detection and prosecution of insider trading one of its top enforcement priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But technology is increasingly blurring the boundaries between public and private information, creating data opportunities that are legal, but are expensive and often require special expertise to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Technology was supposed to level the playing field, but what I see is the fence separating sophisticated and unsophisticated investors growing higher,” says Patatoukas, who is passionate about teaching his students to analyze public sources of financial information and finds the trend troubling. “That’s the dark side of big data. Our evidence suggests that unequal access to alternative data leaves individual investors outside the information loop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to formulate a trading strategy from outer space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RS Metrics pioneered the analysis of satellite images of parking lots in 2011, with hedge funds as their primary customers. Other companies such as Orbital Insight have followed suit, obtaining images from satellite companies and processing them with both software and human analysts. Not only is the data expensive, but it takes substantial skill to analyze and combine with other information sources to yield results, Patatoukas says. “You have to have the right people, and those people tend to be expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patatoukas’ paper lays out exactly how investors can formulate a trading strategy from outer space. Using images from RS metrics from 2011 to 2017 covering 44 major U.S. retailers, including Walmart, Target, Costco, and Whole Foods, the researchers confirmed that year-over-year changes in the number of cars in individual stores’ parking lots is a reliable predictor of quarterly sales—a widely used metric for retailers’ performance. The researchers later added in more images from competing firm Orbital Insight, which covers the same companies, and found that combing the two datasets allowed for even more accurate predictions, and an even more profitable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, parking lot volume is such a reliable indicator of retail sales that it can be used to identify errors in analysts’ forecasts in the three-week period after stores’ quarterly earnings are in, but before they’re announced to the public. Using data from Markit, a service that tracks daily institutional lending activity, they found a boost in stock lending in the five days before earnings announcements. That’s an indication of “informed short selling activity,” targeting retailers with bad news for the quarter (the strategy works with long and short-sale positions, but the researchers found it is most profitable for short sales).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, drilling into data on trading by individual investors during the same period, they found that individuals are net buyers of the same retailers that the hedge funds are betting against. Main Street investors can’t piggyback on what the hedge funds are doing since the short-selling market is opaque: The general investment community can only see short-interest data twice per month, and only with a significant delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of market reaction to earnings announcements, they found no difference between retailers covered by the satellite image companies and those that are not. Clearly, the parking lot intelligence is not increasing price discovery for the market overall, Patatoukas says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the last seven years it’s been a pretty profitable strategy for hedge funds, and the value of the parking lot signals hasn’t yet been competed away. Part of that has to do with the fact that access to satellite imagery data has been so exclusive,” he says. “Once uncertainty about the signals has been removed and it’s known that there’s value to be extracted, more investors will start using it and the advantage will be competed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, Patatoukas says, the dissemination of the working paper itself will impact the market for satellite parking lot data in the short term, since it provides the first independent analysis showing whether—and how—trading from outer space works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been increased regulatory interest in the role of informed trading and disclosure requirements to protect the fairness and integrity of capital markets. With this in mind, Patatoukas hopes that the paper will get the attention of the regulators. “In a market setting where the line separating public from material non-public information is getting blurrier, the question that regulators need to answer is: What is their role in terms of leveling the playing field for individual investors?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the value of the parking lot data will dissipate as technology improves and it becomes more accessible, investors will no doubt find new data sources that will yield insights once only available to company insiders. For example, investors may already be harvesting geolocation data from inside consumers’ pockets as they move around stores with their smartphones, Patatoukas says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Patatoukas says. “While so far the focus has been mostly on the bright side of big and alternative data, there might be a less auspicious side to the rise of such data in capital markets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;You open your browser to look at the Web. Do you know who is looking back at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Over a recent week of Web surfing, I peered under the hood of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and found it brought along a few thousand friends. Shopping, news and even government sites quietly tagged my browser to let ad and data companies ride shotgun while I clicked around the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;This was made possible by the Web’s biggest snoop of all: Google. Seen from the inside, its Chrome browser looks a lot like surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Lately I’ve been investigating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?utm_term=.055f42f6f64d&quot;&gt;secret life of my data&lt;/a&gt;, running experiments to see what technology really gets up to under the cover of privacy policies that nobody reads. It turns out, having the world’s biggest advertising company make the most popular Web browser was about as smart as letting kids run a candy shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;It made me decide to ditch Chrome for a new version of nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, which has default privacy protections. Switching involved less inconvenience than you might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5c7808290310870034cc0d8f&quot;&gt;Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;My tests of Chrome vs. Firefox unearthed a personal data caper of absurd proportions. In a week of Web surfing on my desktop, I discovered 11,189 requests for tracker “cookies” that Chrome would have ushered right onto my computer but were automatically blocked by Firefox. These little files are the hooks that data firms, including Google itself, use to follow what websites you visit so they can build profiles of your interests, income and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Chrome welcomed trackers even at websites you would think would be private. I watched Aetna and the Federal Student Aid website set cookies for Facebook and Google. They surreptitiously told the data giants every time I pulled up the insurance and loan service’s log-in pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;And that’s not the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Look in the upper right corner of your Chrome browser. See a picture or a name in the circle? If so, you’re logged in to the browser, and Google might be tapping into your Web activity to target ads. Don’t recall signing in? I didn’t, either. Chrome recently started doing that automatically when you use Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?utm_term=.9e84f6bad005&quot;&gt;It’s the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Chrome is even sneakier on your phone. If you use Android, Chrome sends Google your location every time you conduct a search. (If you turn off location sharing it still sends your coordinates out, just with less accuracy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Firefox isn’t perfect — it still defaults searches to Google and permits some other tracking. But it doesn’t share browsing data with Mozilla, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise/&quot;&gt;isn’t in the data-collection business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;At a minimum, Web snooping can be annoying. Cookies are how a pair of pants you look at in one site end up following you around in ads elsewhere. More fundamentally, your Web history — like the color of your underpants — ain’t nobody’s business but your own. Letting anyone collect that data leaves it ripe for abuse by bullies, spies and hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Google’s product managers told me in an interview that Chrome prioritizes privacy choices and controls, and they’re working on new ones for cookies. But they also said they have to get the right balance with a “healthy Web ecosystem” (read: ad business).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Firefox’s product managers told me they don’t see privacy as an “option” relegated to controls. They’ve launched a war on surveillance, starting this month with “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/10/23/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection/&quot;&gt;enhanced tracking protection&lt;/a&gt;” that blocks nosy cookies by default on new Firefox installations. But to succeed, first Firefox has to persuade people to care enough to overcome the inertia of switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;It’s a tale of two browsers — and the diverging interests of the companies that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Frrfk4PhRSxKbSKV8rjz4ZaR8Nc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QTH2L5JVMJCBHHGL5XMUFHSBY4.png&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XoV_A0gwt5hLYJPoRI59f8U5CZs=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QTH2L5JVMJCBHHGL5XMUFHSBY4.png&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QTH2L5JVMJCBHHGL5XMUFHSBY4.png&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The Firefox Web browser, seen here on a Mac, gives users the option to sign in to sync bookmarks and login information, but doesn't send browsing data to maker Mozilla. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;The cookie fight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;A decade ago, Chrome and Firefox were taking on Microsoft’s lumbering giant Internet Explorer. The upstart Chrome solved real problems for consumers, making the Web safer and faster. Today it dominates more than half the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Lately, however, many of us have realized that our privacy is also a major concern on the Web — and Chrome’s interests no longer always seem aligned with our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;That’s most visible in the fight over cookies. These code snippets can do helpful things, like remembering the contents of your shopping cart. But now many cookies belong to data companies, which use them to tag your browser so they can follow your path like crumbs in the proverbial forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;They’re everywhere — &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01514.pdf&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found third-party tracking cookies on 92 percent of websites. The Washington Post website has about 40 tracker cookies, average for a news site, which the company said in a statement are used to deliver better-targeted ads and track ad performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/06/alexa-has-been-eavesdropping-you-this-whole-time/?utm_term=.04b8aa2467c9&quot;&gt;Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;You’ll also find them on sites without ads: Both Aetna and the FSA service said the cookies on their sites help measure their own external marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;The blame for this mess belongs to the entire advertising, publishing and tech industries. But what responsibility does a browser have in protecting us from code that isn’t doing much more than spying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mabAi3XUYkAMwQTqDHw5wWSnck8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CBLL7SFJ5VGJDNXJKHV662UVUY.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RORrJs9QjLV8tGmYo_loPaPNi-M=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CBLL7SFJ5VGJDNXJKHV662UVUY.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CBLL7SFJ5VGJDNXJKHV662UVUY.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;To see what cookies Firefox has blocked for a Web page, tap the shield icon, then &quot;Blocking Tracker Cookies&quot; to pull up a list. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;In 2015, Mozilla debuted a version of Firefox that included anti-tracking tech, turned on only in its “private” browsing mode. After years of testing and tweaking, that’s what it activated this month on all websites. This isn’t about blocking ads — those still come through. Rather, Firefox is parsing cookies to decide which ones to keep for critical site functions and which ones to block for spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Apple’s Safari browser, used on iPhones, also began applying “&lt;a href=&quot;https://webkit.org/blog/8613/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-1/&quot;&gt;intelligent tracking protection&lt;/a&gt;” to cookies in 2017, using an algorithm to decide which ones were bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Chrome, so far, remains open to all cookies by default. Last month, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new effort to force third-party cookies to better self-identify, and said we can expect new controls for them after it rolls out. But it wouldn’t offer a timeline or say whether it would default to stopping trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;I’m not holding my breath. Google itself, through its Doubleclick and other ad businesses, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://whotracks.me/&quot;&gt;No. 1 cookie&lt;/a&gt; maker — the Mrs. Fields of the Web. It’s hard to imagine Chrome ever cutting off Google’s moneymaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;“Cookies play a role in user privacy, but a narrow focus on cookies obscures the broader privacy discussion because it’s just one way in which users can be tracked across sites,” said Ben Galbraith, Chrome’s director of product management. “This is a complex problem, and simple, blunt cookie blocking solutions force tracking into more opaque practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;There are other tracking techniques — and the privacy arms race will get harder. But saying things are too complicated is also a way of not doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;“Our viewpoint is to deal with the biggest problem first, but anticipate where the ecosystem will shift and work on protecting against those things as well,” said Peter Dolanjski, Firefox’s product lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;Both Google and Mozilla said they’re working on fighting “fingerprinting,” a way to sniff out other markers in your computer. Firefox is already testing its capabilities and plans to activate them soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F_WjiYbKxR5a56ISmpRviwuQOPw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSNXNVDWGUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pF07TGX6vN2sUC2fUBXPUMJocdw=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSNXNVDWGUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSNXNVDWGUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai, pictured at the company's 2019 I/O conference, led product management of the Chrome browser earlier in his career. (Jeff Chiu/AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Making the switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Choosing a browser is no longer just about speed and convenience — it’s also about data defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;It’s true that Google usually obtains consent before gathering data, and offers a lot of knobs you can adjust to opt out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity&quot;&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated&quot;&gt;targeted advertising&lt;/a&gt;. But its controls often feel like a shell game that results in us sharing more personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;I felt hoodwinked when Google quietly began signing Gmail users into Chrome last fall. Google says the Chrome shift didn’t cause anybody’s browsing history to be “synced” unless they specifically opted in — but I found mine was being sent to Google and don’t recall ever asking for extra surveillance. (You can turn off the Gmail auto-login by searching “Gmail” in Chrome settings and switching off “Allow Chrome sign-in.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;41&quot;&gt;After the sign-in shift, Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green made waves in the computer science world when he blogged he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/&quot;&gt;done with Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. “I lost faith,” he told me. “It only takes a few tiny changes to make it very privacy unfriendly.”&lt;/p&gt;

When “sync” is also on, Google receives your browsing history. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot;&gt;There are ways to defang Chrome, which is much more complicated than just using “Incognito Mode.” But it’s much easier to switch to a browser not owned by an advertising company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Like Green, I’ve chosen Firefox, which works across phones, tablets, PCs and Macs. Apple’s Safari is also a good option on Macs, iPhones and iPads, and the niche &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/&quot;&gt;Brave browser&lt;/a&gt; goes even further in trying to jam the ad-tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;45&quot;&gt;What does switching to Firefox cost you? It’s free, and downloading a different browser is much simpler than changing phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;46&quot;&gt;In 2017, Mozilla launched a new version of Firefox called &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/&quot;&gt;Quantum&lt;/a&gt; that made it considerably faster. In my tests, it has felt almost as fast as Chrome, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/3213031/best-web-browsers.html?page=2&quot;&gt;benchmark tests&lt;/a&gt; have found it can be slower in some contexts. Firefox says it’s better about managing memory if you use lots and lots of tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;47&quot;&gt;Switching means you’ll have to move your bookmarks, and Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/switch-chrome-firefox-just-minutes/&quot;&gt;offers tools to help.&lt;/a&gt; Shifting passwords is easy if you use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/12/your-password-has-likely-been-stolen-heres-what-do-about-it/?utm_term=.d052335a3dbd&quot;&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt;. And most browser add-ons are available, though it’s possible you won’t find your favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Mozilla has challenges to overcome. Among privacy advocates, the nonprofit is known for caution. It took a year longer than Apple to make cookie blocking a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;49&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/07/when-tax-prep-is-free-you-may-be-paying-with-your-privacy/?utm_term=.82f1e601ef59&quot;&gt;When tax prep is free, you may be paying with your privacy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;50&quot;&gt;And as a nonprofit, it earns money when people make searches in the browser and click on ads — which means its biggest source of income is Google. Mozilla’s chief executive says the company is exploring new paid privacy services to diversify its income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Its biggest risk is that Firefox might someday run out of steam in its battle with the Chrome behemoth. Even though it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide&quot;&gt;No. 2 desktop browser,&lt;/a&gt; with about 10 percent of the market, major sites could decide to drop support, leaving Firefox scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;52&quot;&gt;If you care about privacy, let’s hope for another David and Goliath outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Gmail confidential mode is not secure or private</title>
<link>https://protonmail.com/blog/gmail-confidential-mode-security-privacy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://protonmail.com/blog/gmail-confidential-mode-security-privacy/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Without end-to-end encryption, Gmail confidential mode is little more than a marketing strategy. Learn why privacy experts call Google’s privacy features “misleading.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we launched ProtonMail nearly five years ago, we pioneered a new kind of email service: one that gives you control of your own data. All emails are &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;end-to-end encrypted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/zero-access-encryption/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;zero-access encrypted&lt;/a&gt;, meaning not even we can read them. We also offer the ability to set expiring emails, which self-destruct after a period of time chosen by the sender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years later, Google tried to integrate some of these same features into Gmail with “confidential mode.” Even though Google launched confidential mode over a year ago, people are still confused about what it does. Is it actually secure or private? Is it encrypted? When you turn it on, does it prevent Google from reading your messages? The answer to these questions is ‘no.’ In fact, the decision to call it “confidential” suggests a level of security and privacy that doesn’t exist in Gmail confidential mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmail’s confidential mode does not mean your messages are end-to-end encrypted. Google can still read them. Expiring messages aren’t erased for good, and the recipient can always take a screenshot of your message. Let’s take a closer look at how confidential mode works and why it isn’t so confidential after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does Gmail’s confidential mode do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmail unveiled confidential mode in April 2018 with its last major inbox redesign. The feature lets users optionally activate confidential mode from within the composer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ScnAyFaLjNiPzsRJvXfTNN1rm5lQVNdoOYybklPunzDsswMqzJzVZEfxXF5uP9gUxLZKcnIHv79AC-h9SRdkXe9N69aJX40oB9FS6p9Um5wiNqlOZbLwHGnvhfN7Tqj8MSeApPx-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you turn on confidential mode, a panel appears which gives you two options. The first lets you choose when you want the email to expire so that the recipient can no longer read it (you can also revoke access to sent mail at any time). A second option allows you to require the recipient to enter a passcode to access the message. Google generates the passcode and sends it to the recipient’s phone via SMS, so you need to know your recipient’s phone number. Additionally, emails sent in confidential mode cannot be forwarded, copied, downloaded, or printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problems with confidential mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmail’s confidential mode does not make emails private because Google can always read them.&lt;/strong&gt; When you send an email with confidential mode turned on, Google keeps the email contents on its servers. Other Gmail users can read the email in their inbox, but outside users only receive an email notifying them that a sender “has sent you an email via Gmail confidential mode” along with a link to a page on google.com. (This is similar to ProtonMail’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/encrypt-for-outside-users/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;encrypt to outside&lt;/a&gt; feature.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the email expires, it is no longer accessible to the recipient. But the message remains in the sender’s sent folder, which Google can also read. &lt;strong&gt;This is not an expiring email.&lt;/strong&gt; It can still be accessed by Google and potentially exposed to governments or hackers. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/between-you-me-and-google-problems-gmails-confidential-mode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, “Because messages sent with Confidential Mode are still retrievable—by the sender and by Google—after the ‘expiration date,’ we think that calling them expired is misleading.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passcode option is a further privacy invasion. &lt;strong&gt;If you choose to set a passcode for your recipient, you must turn over their private phone number to Google.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are sending a message to a Gmail user, Google likely already knows their phone number from reading their emails or from other Google products. But if you send a passcode-protected email to a non-Google user, you have just allowed the company to link that individual’s phone number to their email address as well as whatever sensitive information is in your message. This is an effective way for Google to gather information about people, who likely have refused to use their service to avoid just such data collection. It also means Google knows quite a bit about your supposedly confidential email.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other supposed security benefit of confidential mode is the inability of the recipient to forward, copy, download, or print the email. “This helps reduce the risk of confidential information being accidentally shared with the wrong people,” Google says. While it’s true this may reduce the risk of accidental data exposure, it is not real security. &lt;strong&gt;The recipient can simply take a screenshot of the email.&lt;/strong&gt; “I was able to easily make a screenshot and paste it into a new email and send it to a friend,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/gmails-new-confidential-mode-is-laughably-insecure-very-silly.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;wrote one reviewer&lt;/a&gt; for Inc. “It takes about 10 seconds. Anyone who uses MS Paint can figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ProtonMail is different from Gmail confidential mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you send an email from your ProtonMail email address to another ProtonMail user, the message is encrypted on your device using the public key of your recipient. This happens automatically, every time. When you hit send, the email travels to your recipient in encrypted form. The recipient then decrypts the message with their corresponding private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/e2eediagram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5054&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; srcset=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/e2eediagram.jpg 697w, https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/e2eediagram-300x285.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we do not have access to the recipient’s private key, we are never able to read the message. We do have access to metadata, like the email addresses, timestamp, and subject line. (It’s a bit like locking a vault with your friend’s key and then mailing it to them. You can read a full explanation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;how end-to-end encryption works&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail also lets you send end-to-end encrypted emails to non-ProtonMail accounts (such as your friends and family on Gmail, to prevent Google from reading your messages to them). Similar to Gmail confidential mode, this works by using a passcode as well. The difference is that with ProtonMail, you can choose the password yourself and communicate it to your recipient however you’d like. Moreover, the message is end-to-end encrypted, and we cannot read it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, ProtonMail also offers the ability to send expiring emails, except in our case, the emails really do disappear after the expiration time. This works both for emails sent to other ProtonMail users and to non-ProtonMail addresses (provided you set a password for the latter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is possible to forward, copy, download, and print ProtonMail emails. But again, this is also possible in Gmail confidential mode just by taking a screenshot. To advertise this benefit as a “security feature” misleads users into a false sense of security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without end-to-end encryption, Gmail’s confidential mode is little more than a marketing trick designed to pacify users concerned about privacy. Fortunately, you don’t need to settle for fake privacy. You can join the more than 10 million people using ProtonMail to secure their communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;The ProtonMail Team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t stop checking your phone, even when you’re not expecting any important messages? Blame your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study by researchers at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business has found that information acts on the brain’s dopamine-producing reward system in the same way as money or food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the brain, information is its own reward, above and beyond whether it’s useful,” says Assoc. Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/hsu-ming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ming Hsu&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroeconomist whose research employs functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), psychological theory, economic modeling, and machine learning. “And just as our brains like empty calories from junk food, they can overvalue information that makes us feel good but may not be useful—what some may call idle curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;

Prof. Ming Hsu of the Haas Marketing Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/10/1820145116&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Common neural code for reward and information value&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published this month by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Authored by Hsu and graduate student Kenji Kobayashi, now a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, it demonstrates that the brain converts information into the same common scale as it does for money. It also lays the groundwork for unraveling the neuroscience behind how we consume information—and perhaps even digital addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were able to demonstrate for the first time the existence of a common neural code for information and money, which opens the door to a number of exciting questions about how people consume, and sometimes over-consume, information,” Hsu says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooted in the study of curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is rooted in the study of curiosity and what it looks like inside the brain. While economists have tended to view curiosity as a means to an end, valuable when it can help us get information to gain an edge in making decisions, psychologists have long seen curiosity as an innate motivation that can spur actions by itself. For example, sports fans might check the odds on a game even if they have no intention of ever betting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we want to know something, just to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study tried to answer two questions. First, can we reconcile the economic and psychological views of curiosity, or why do people seek information? Second, what does curiosity look like inside the brain?” Hsu says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The neuroscience of curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand more about the neuroscience of curiosity, the researchers scanned the brains of people while they played a gambling game. Each participant was presented with a series of lotteries and needed to decide how much they were willing to pay to find out more about the odds of winning. In some lotteries, the information was valuable—for example, when what seemed like a longshot was revealed to be a sure thing. In other cases, the information wasn’t worth much, such as when little was at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the study subjects made rational choices based on the economic value of the information (how much money it could help them win). But that didn’t explain all their choices: People tended to over-value information in general, and particularly in higher-valued lotteries. It appeared that the higher stakes increased people’s curiosity in the information, even when the information had no effect on their decisions whether to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that this behavior could only be explained by a model that captured both economic and psychological motives for seeking information. People acquired information based not only on its actual benefit, but also on the anticipation of its benefit, whether or not it had use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hsu says that’s akin to wanting to know whether we received a great job offer, even if we have no intention of taking it. “Anticipation serves to amplify how good or bad something seems, and the anticipation of a more pleasurable reward makes the information appear even more valuable,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common neural code for information and money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the brain respond to information? Analyzing the fMRI scans, the researchers found that the information about the games’ odds activated the regions of the brain specifically known to be involved in valuation (the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex or VMPFC), which are the same dopamine-producing reward areas activated by food, money, and many drugs. This was the case whether the information was useful, and changed the person’s original decision, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers were able to determine that the brain uses the same neural code for information about the lottery odds as it does for money by using a machine learning technique (called support vector regression). That allowed them to look at the neural code for how the brain responds to varying amounts of money, and then ask if the same code can be used to predict how much a person will pay for information. It can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, just as we can convert such disparate things as a painting, a steak dinner, and a vacation into a dollar value, the brain converts curiosity about information into the same common code it uses for concrete rewards like money, Hsu says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can look into the brain and tell how much someone wants a piece of information, and then translate that brain activity into monetary amounts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising questions about digital addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the research does not directly address overconsumption of digital information, the fact that information engages the brain’s reward system is a necessary condition for the addiction cycle, he says. And it explains why we find those alerts saying we’ve been tagged in a photo so irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way our brains respond to the anticipation of a pleasurable reward is an important reason why people are susceptible to clickbait,” he says. “Just like junk food, this might be a situation where previously adaptive mechanisms get exploited now that we have unprecedented access to novel curiosities.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How information is like snacks, money, and drugs—to your brain | Haas News | Berkeley Haas</og:title>
<og:description>Can’t stop checking your phone, even when you’re not expecting any important messages? Blame your brain. A new study by researchers at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business has found that information acts on the brain’s dopamine-producing reward system in the same way as money or food. “To the brain, information is its own reward,</og:description>

<title>SSH gets protection against side-channel attacks</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;attrib&quot;&gt;Contributed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://undeadly.org&quot;&gt;Paul 'WEiRD' de Weerd&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-06-21T06:33:51Z&quot;&gt;2019-06-21&lt;/time&gt; from the Sshould be a sshecret dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damien Miller (&lt;code&gt;djm@&lt;/code&gt;) has just &lt;a href=&quot;https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;amp;m=156109087822676&amp;amp;w=2&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; a new feature for SSH that should help protect against all the various memory side channel attacks that have surfaced recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add protection for private keys at rest in RAM against speculation and memory sidechannel attacks like Spectre, Meltdown, Rowhammer and Rambleed. This change encrypts private keys when they are not in use with a symmetic key that is derived from a relatively large &quot;prekey&quot; consisting of random data (currently 16KB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers must recover the entire prekey with high accuracy before they can attempt to decrypt the shielded private key, but the current generation of attacks have bit error rates that, when applied cumulatively to the entire prekey, make this unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation-wise, keys are encrypted &quot;shielded&quot; when loaded and then automatically and transparently unshielded when used for signatures or when being saved/serialised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we can remove this in a few years time when computer architecture has become less unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been in snaps for a bit already; thanks deraadt@&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok dtucker@ deraadt@&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Damien and all the others involved for working on this improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My MacBook Pro exploded and burst into flames</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bulbhv/my_macbook_pro_exploded_and_burst_into_flames/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Yesterday afternoon my MacBook Pro exploded during normal use. It was on my lap, plugged in, and suddenly started to spew smoke out both sides. I quickly placed it on the floor where it popped, the smoke increased, and it caught fire. Toxic smelling smoke filled my house triggering smoke and CO alarms. No one was injured, thankfully, but there was some damage to my home. The situation could have been much worse - imagine if I had been on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;I went inside and was able to remove the computer to the porch using gloves (it was scalding hot). Below is a short video taken when I re-entered the house a few minutes after the explosion. After it cooled for an hour or so, I took it to the local Apple store in a rage. They understood the severity of the situation but said nothing could be done until it spent 24 hours in a fire-proof safe and that they'd call me with a plan/update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;They did not call. I reached out today and was told it had been &quot;escalated&quot; and I should hear something within FIVE days. I produce music for a living - FIVE days without my computer is unacceptable. It seemed like a worthwhile piece of information to share with the world, so there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;EDIT: the explosion was yesterday afternoon. earlier version said &quot;this afternoon&quot; and had people confused about timeline. apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;EDIT: For those speculating that my music caused the explosion, you can listen here: &lt;a class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-27 dOJMiP&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/1mOUOvOOaoTF2b3kDjrety?si=ivcbXEKVTj6qn4hPPLvBdw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://open.spotify.com/artist/1mOUOvOOaoTF2b3kDjrety?si=ivcbXEKVTj6qn4hPPLvBdw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lenovo Shipping Ubuntu Linux on 2019 ThinkPad</title>
<link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/lenovo-shipping-ubuntu-linux-on-2019-thinkpad-p-series-models/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techrepublic.com/article/lenovo-shipping-ubuntu-linux-on-2019-thinkpad-p-series-models/</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;It's possible to purchase Lenovo's high-performance ThinkPad systems with Ubuntu shipped from the factory, starting with 2019 models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component=&quot;lazyloadImages&quot; readability=&quot;59.280198776758&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's newly-announced 2019 ThinkPad P-series mobile workstations can be purchased with Ubuntu, according to the ordering page on Lenovo's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/c/thinkpadp?IPromoID=LEN741265&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/product/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt; have often been the laptop of choice for Linux users, as Lenovo historically does certify ThinkPad models for Linux use, though prior to this change, buyers were stuck paying the Windows tax for the unwanted bundled license of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicable models can be configured with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and will be available this month. Though not offered as a preloadable option, the P-series is also certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo announced 2019 models of the ThinkPad P73, ThinkPad P53, ThinkPad P53s, and P43s, as well as the ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 last week, powered by 9th Generation Intel Core CPUs. The new models introduce OLED displays on certain units, as well as X-Rite Pantone factory color calibration, which is a substantive benefit for content creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/16-top-laptops-for-business-users-in-2019-free-pdf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 top laptops for business users in 2019 (free PDF)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (TechRepublic)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P-series ThinkPads are closer to a desktop replacement than anything else, as these units come with more expandability options than the T or X-series, and higher-performance NVIDIA graphics. Buyers can also upgrade to Intel Xeon Mobile CPUs on the P-series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is yet to be seen if this option will be extended to other ThinkPad models. Jerry Paradise, Lenovo's vice president of global commercial portfolio and product management, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/meditations-on-first-thinkpad-how-lenovo-adapts-to-changes-in-the-pc-industry/&quot;&gt;told TechRepublic in May&lt;/a&gt; that having Linux installed from the factory &quot;comes up over and over with some of our very important customers, and it is taken very seriously,&quot; Paradise noted, adding that Lenovo &quot;provides drivers and a BIOS that is compatible,&quot; reiterating that &quot;we get that request a lot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Which has more sales: a single long checkout form or a multi-step one?</title>
<link>https://capitalandgrowth.org/questions/2055/which-has-a-higher-conversion-rate-a-single-long-e.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://capitalandgrowth.org/questions/2055/which-has-a-higher-conversion-rate-a-single-long-e.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Jeffery,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there's are a lot of opinions on this but I don't see sites publishing a lot of results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to conduct a meta-analysis on this subject, specifically the use of accordion shopping carts as a tactic to try and reduce perceived length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, at the end of the day, it's perceived length that we are trying to attack right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see these two sources cited a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1165-baymard-image.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1166-statista-image.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem with these studies is that the users DONT specify what they mean by long and confusing. Do they mean long as in multiple pages? Or long as in one really long page?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I do have some actual public test data around this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a test trying to solve the issue... namely using a multi-page approach versus an accordion approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1167-carttest1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result: Version B (the accordion) recorded a 29.1% Relative Decrease in Conversions (99% LoC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like bad news for accordions... or single page tactics... but actually, it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these BELOW tests show us a different story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1168-carttest2.png&quot;/&gt;This one? No statistically significant difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1169-carttest3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again... no statistically significant difference in performance...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet another test... this time even in the not-for-profit space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1170-carttest4.png&quot;/&gt;No statistically significant difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally... the kind of test you've been looking for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1171-carttest5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version A is PRETTY MUCH a one-pager... with a confirmation page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Version B attempts at what you are describing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No statistically significant difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, however, have seen this type of adjustment increase performance, but not in the checkout process itself, but in terms of eliminating that cart review step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://capitalandgrowth.org/storage/attachments/1172-carttest6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? 28.6% relative increase in conversion (95% LoC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have personally run two tests with two different ecomm companies (one B2C, one B2B) where cleaning up the whole account creation process (easing the friction / requirements in it) did produce statistically significant increases in conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again... even that is classified as a different thing in those initial surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My advice? Focus first on other things in the cart, like easing anxiety and second-guessing by adding reassurance (trust marks, testimonials) near the credit card and completion steps, as well as some guarantee language that you may have used earlier in the product exploration process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If multiple pages allows you to do THOSE types of things easier... go with multiple pages. If a single long page allows you to execute those things easier, then go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you take care of those, then you can test to see if this particular variables makes a move for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;
