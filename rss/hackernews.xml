<title>What’s New in macOS Big Sur: Human Interface Guidelines</title>

<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new-in-macos&quot;&gt;What’s New in macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS 11 introduces many user interface changes that update the appearance of apps and make them more approachable to people transitioning from iPad apps. macOS 11 also adds support for familiar iOS features — such as SF Symbols and text styles — that enhance the user experience and can streamline the app design process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/whats-new-hero.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of a MacBook Pro, displaying Calendar and Maps. Calendar lists events for the WWDC Keynote, a FaceTime lunch, and a workout. Maps displays a map and a sheet that describes the location of the Steve Jobs Theater.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;421&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you build your app for macOS 11, you’ll find that most of the updates are automatic when you use system-defined elements with SwiftUI or Auto Layout; if your app is highly customized, you may have additional work to do. As you think about updating your app for macOS 11, review the following changes to help you plan your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;icons-and-images&quot;&gt;Icons and Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS 11 refreshes icon design throughout the system, bringing a uniform shape to app icons and a refined appearance to document icons. In addition, macOS 11 introduces multipurpose feature icons that can represent items or functions in sidebars and tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of SF Symbols imparts a strong visual consistency to glyphs and icons throughout the system, and gives you an easy way to create images and icons that look at home everywhere. macOS 11 automatically maps AppKit shared images — such as Action, Unlocked, and Share — to specific symbols. In some cases, a symbol might not have the same size or alignment as the AppKit image it replaces, so it's a good idea to check your layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;app-icons&quot;&gt;App Icons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In macOS 11, the design language for app icons promotes consistency with all platforms while retaining the lifelike rendering style typical of macOS icons. App icons combine a rounded-rectangle shape, a front-facing perspective, and a consistent drop shadow to provide a unified visual experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/mail-photos-preferences-big-sur.png&quot; alt=&quot;Images of app icons for Mail, Photos, and System Preferences as seen in macOS 11. The Mail icon shows a white envelope on a blue rounded rectangle. The envelope uses shading to suggest a three dimensional object. The Photos icon shows eight lozenge shapes fanned out in a circle on a white rounded rectangle background. Each shape is a different color of the rainbow. The System Preferences icon shows two concentric circular gears, both with many teeth, set into a gray rounded rectangle.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;117&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the design language strongly encourages visual consistency, it doesn’t preclude judicious expressiveness. For example, the Preview, Xcode, and TextEdit icons continue to combine depictions of the physical objects that best convey the app’s core purpose, while incorporating the new shape, perspective, and shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/preview-xcode-text-edit-big-sur.png&quot; alt=&quot;Images of app icons for Preview, Xcode, and TextEdit as seen in macOS 11. The Preview icon shows an image of an ocean scene surrounded by a white rounded rectangular border. In front of the image in the bottom-right corner is a camera loupe. The Xcode icon shows the capital letter A formed out of three cylinders outlined in white, surrounded by a white outlined circle. The circle and letter are shown on a blue rounded rectangle background. In front of the image is a realistic image of a claw hammer, slanting to the right. The TextEdit icon shows an image of white paper ruled with gray horizontal lines and one red vertical line that indicates the left margin. The image is masked to a rounded rectangle shape and it includes a realistic mechanical pencil in front of it, slanting from top-right to bottom-left.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;138&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;document-icons&quot;&gt;Document Icons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compose a document icon, the system combines your app icon with the familiar folded-corner icon shape. If your app opens or creates a large number of document types, you can also supply a custom center image or background appearance to help people distinguish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/document-icons.png&quot; alt=&quot;Images of document icons for ARKit, Xcode, and Preview as seen in macOS 11. The ARKit icon shows a chair within a cube drawn in yellow lines. The Xcode icon shows a shape that looks like the letter A within a circle and the word Project below it. The background is blue. The Preview icon displays the Preview app icon above the abbreviation JPG.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;390&quot; height=&quot;117&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;feature-icons&quot;&gt;Feature Icons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; icon can represent an item (or category of items), a technology, or a type of information in a table view or in the content sidebar of a preferences window. A feature icon typically uses the macOS 11 rounded rectangle shape to contain a simple, unambiguous glyph, but it can also use custom shapes and colors. For help designing a feature icon, download the production template included in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#macos-apps&quot;&gt;Apple Design Resources&lt;/a&gt; for macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row no-padding-top no-padding-bottom&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-12 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;nav class=&quot;tabnav&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;bxslider feature-icons-gallery no-margin&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/feature-icons.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of Safari Websites preferences, highlighted to show the icons in the list of items that websites can use. Each icon uses a rounded rectangle shape, a colored background, and a glyph.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/feature-icons-catalina.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of Safari Websites preferences, highlighted to show the icons in the list of items that websites can use. Icons use a mix of shapes and colors, and most display a glyph.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;app-accent-colors&quot;&gt;App Accent Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In macOS 11, you can specify an accent color to customize the appearance of your app’s buttons, selection highlighting, and sidebar glyphs. The system applies your accent color when the current value in General &amp;gt; Accent color preferences is &lt;em&gt;multicolor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row no-padding-top no-padding-bottom&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/app-accent-colors-podcasts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of the Podcasts app, highlighted to show the sidebar. Each item in the sidebar includes a glyph followed by the item's title. Every glyph uses the Podcasts app's purple accent color.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/app-accent-colors-podcasts-preferences.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the General preferences pane of the Podcasts app. The app's purple accent color is visible in the toolbar icon that represents General and in the content area's pop-menus.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people set the Accent color preferences to a value other than multicolor, the system applies their chosen color to the relevant items throughout your app, replacing your accent color. The exception is a sidebar glyph that uses a fixed color you specify. Because a fixed-color sidebar glyph uses a specific color to provide meaning, the system doesn’t override its color when people change the value of Accent color preferences. To learn more, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/whats-new-in-macos/#sidebars&quot;&gt;Sidebars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/fixed-color-orange.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of a Finder window, cropped to show the sidebar.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;275&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;typography-caption text-center&quot;&gt;The iCloud glyph remains teal, even when the other glyphs use orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;windows-and-views&quot;&gt;Windows and Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout macOS 11, windows adopt visual touches that recall iOS interfaces. For example, windows integrate the sidebar, toolbar, and content areas, use an increased corner radius, and display lightweight controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/windows-views.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Mail app, showing the mail boxes on the left, the Inbox message list in the middle, and the selected message on the right. The selected message includes a photo of some buildings in a city and the message reads Hi Greg, Here's where I think we should go...recognize it?&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;toolbars-and-title-bars&quot;&gt;Toolbars and Title Bars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, toolbars are taller, window titles can display inline with controls, and toolbar items no longer include a bezel. The increased height and bezel-free controls combine to give macOS 11 toolbars a streamlined appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match the default toolbar’s increased height, toolbar items automatically use the large control size. The exception is an integrated toolbar-title bar area — such as the one in a Safari window — which continues to use the regular control size. To accommodate the new default size, you’ll probably need to adjust the layout of your toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row no-padding-top no-padding-bottom&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/toolbar-system-controls.png&quot; alt=&quot;Closeup of the toolbar in a Finder window, which uses a white background and controls that don't include a bezel. From the left, the toolbar shows the icons, list, column, and gallery view buttons, the item grouping button, and the share button.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;typography-caption text-center&quot;&gt;Finder toolbar controls in macOS 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/toolbar-system-controls-catalina.png&quot; alt=&quot;Closeup of the toolbar in a Finder window, which uses a gray background and controls that include bezels. From the left, the toolbar shows the icons, list, column, and gallery view buttons, the item grouping button, the action menu, and the share button.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;typography-caption text-center&quot;&gt;Finder toolbar controls in macOS 10.15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9.4833948339483&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/1531777-minsize&quot;&gt;minSize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbaritem/1526451-maxsize&quot;&gt;maxSize&lt;/a&gt; APIs to set the size of a toolbar item can clip the control, because the current values don’t account for the larger default size. Use constraints if you need to specify minimum or maximum sizes for a toolbar control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When horizontal space is limited, the toolbar can display the Search button in place of the search bar. When people click the Search button, the bar expands; when they click elsewhere in the window, the search bar collapses and the toolbar displays the button again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row no-padding-top no-padding-bottom&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/toolbar-search-collapsed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of the top-right corner of a Finder window, highlighted to show the search button.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-6 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/toolbar-search-expanded.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of the top-right corner of a Finder window, highlighted to show the search field.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preferences window, the toolbar can use SF Symbols to harmonize with the appearance of the main window, but the title position remains above the toolbar buttons. When needed for clarity, individual toolbar buttons can include color. To indicate the active preference pane, the window applies a system-provided selection appearance to the selected toolbar button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your window includes multiple panes, you can align different subsets of toolbar items with each pane, so that as people resize the window, each set of items remains above its associated view.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In macOS 11, a sidebar (technically known as a &lt;em&gt;source list&lt;/em&gt;) extends to the full height of the window. Within the sidebar, default item spacing, row height, and glyph size all increase, and the selected-item highlight uses a rounded-corner appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sidebar’s row height, text, and glyph size depend on its overall size, which can be small, medium, or large. You can set the size programmatically, but users can also change it by selecting a different sidebar icon size in General preferences. The table below shows the differences in default sidebar metrics between macOS 11 and previous versions of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Sidebar size&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Small&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Row height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SF symbol scale&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium *&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Glyph size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16pt × 16pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text size (style)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11pt (Subhead)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Row height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SF symbol scale&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Glyph size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20pt × 20pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18pt × 18pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text size (style)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13pt (Body)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Large&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Row height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SF symbol scale&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Glyph size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24pt × 24pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24pt × 24pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text size (style)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15pt (Title 3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;All&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Horizontal spacing between cells&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vertical spacing between cells&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*In some cases, a small sidebar may use small-scale SF Symbols by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using SF Symbols is the easiest way to create sidebar glyphs that use the new metrics. Alternatively, you can use PDF template images to create sidebar glyphs; if you must use bitmap images, be sure to create them in small, medium, and large sizes, at both @1x and @2x resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, sidebar glyphs use the current accent color (to learn more, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/whats-new-in-macos/#app-accent-colors&quot;&gt;App Accent Colors&lt;/a&gt;). If you need to clarify the meaning of an individual sidebar glyph, you can give it a fixed color that persists regardless of the user’s Accent color preferences. Don’t use the ability to specify a fixed color to stylize your app as a whole. In macOS, people expect to see their chosen accent color throughout all the apps they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;table-views&quot;&gt;Table Views&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In macOS 11, table views are larger overall, using taller rows, a larger font size, and more space between items to increase visual separation within and around table content. macOS 11 introduces three table-view styles to define different appearances that work well in specific window areas: inset, full-width, and automatic. For developer guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/3622475-style&quot;&gt;NSTableView.style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inset style adds insets to the expanded spaciousness of macOS 11 tables. Because the inset style increases the visual space around the content, it works well in tables that fill the area between other views — such as sidebars and toolbars — and echoes the changes in sidebar appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/table-views-inset.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a Finder window, highlighted to show the content area in list view. The list view displays several folders and documents using inset row backgrounds that alternate in color between light gray and white.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic, full-width table style remains available, but automatically includes the required content padding at the beginning and end of each row. The full-width style works best for tables that already have a visual margin around them, such as a table embedded in a preferences pane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/table-views-full.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Accessibility preferences. In the left side of the window, the list of specific accessibility areas is set off from the rest of the window by a thin gray border. The list uses a gray bar that meets the border on both side edges to show the selected item.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt; style means the system uses the table view’s position in the view hierarchy to help determine its appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create more spacious tables, macOS 11 uses several new table-view metrics. In the diagrams that follow, you can see how the layout of a table row differs between macOS 11 and macOS 10.15 and earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row no-padding-top no-padding-bottom&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column large-12 small-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;nav class=&quot;tabnav&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;bxslider table-diagram-gallery no-margin&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/table-views-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of the layout for a single table row. Vertical bars of varying widths represent the placement of the row's content and areas of padding or other empty space. Callouts indicate the row's height and name each item in the row, and colors are used to distinguish row items. From the left, a black area indicates an inset from the left edge. Next is a light blue area that indicates padding. Next is a white area that represents the first cell of row content, which is labeled Column 0. After column 0 is a gray area that indicates intercell spacing. Next is a white area that represents a variable number of additional cells, followed by another gray area of intercell spacing. The last cell is represented by a white area labeled Column N minus 1, which is followed by a light blue area of padding and a black inset area.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;120&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Next is a white area that represents a variable number of additional cells, followed by another gray area of intercell spacing. The last cell is represented by a white area labeled Column N minus 1, which is followed by a black area that indicates half intercell spacing.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;120&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the values for the table-row layout areas shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Table-view metric&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;macOS 11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;macOS 10.15 and earlier&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Recommended row height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Minimum row height for text-only rows&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Inset at leading and trailing row edges&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10pt (inset style); 0pt (other styles)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Padding at leading and trailing row edges&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Intercell spacing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(17,0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text size (style)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13pt (Body)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the values listed in the table above, inset-style tables in macOS 11 also include a 10pt vertical inset before the first row and after the last row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you adjust the layout of your table content to follow the new metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your icons or glyphs can fit into a 16pt × 16pt area when you use the recommended 24pt row height&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider adding 6 points of space between items within a row to ensure a spacious table appearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t update your app, the appearance of your tables doesn’t change when your app runs in macOS 11. The exception is a table that implements a sidebar. If you identify the table style as a &lt;em&gt;source list&lt;/em&gt;, the system automatically applies the new sidebar appearance. For guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/whats-new-in-macos/#sidebars&quot;&gt;Sidebars&lt;/a&gt;; for developer guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstableview/style/sourcelist&quot;&gt;NSTableView.style.sourceList&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt; In macOS 11, a table's width continues to equal the width of its rows, but the new padding and insets prevent columns and cells from covering the entire row. The system also uses the specified style to determine the space to add to row background features, like selection appearance or alternating row colors. If you need to provide content that completely covers a row — such as a custom background appearance — add it to the row instead of the cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;sheets&quot;&gt;Sheets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheets no longer unfurl from the bottom edge of the parent window’s toolbar. In macOS 11, a sheet is a rounded rectangle view that floats on top of the dimmed parent window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/sheets-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of the Maps app, highlighted to show a sheet that lists three options for walking directions from Mineta San Jose International Airport to Apple Park Visitor Center.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;alerts&quot;&gt;Alerts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerts are cardlike rectangles that use the same corner radius as all windows in macOS 11. Within an alert, most content is center aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/alert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an alert that displays the full trash icon and the title Are you sure you want to permanently erase the items in the Trash? Below the title is the text You can't undo this action. At the bottom of the alert are the Cancel button on the left and the Empty Trash button on the right. The Empty Trash button uses a blue background.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;275&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use red text to emphasize a destructive action in an alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/images/alert-destructive-action.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an alert that displays the Podcasts app icon and the title Delete Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls from Library? Below the title are two stacked buttons. The top button uses red text and is titled Delete from Library. The bottom button is titled Cancel.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;275&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;macOS 11 introduces visual changes to menus and menu content. If you use standard menus and menu items, you get the following default appearances automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menu item titles use the same 13-point font size as sidebars and window content areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu separator lines are 1 point thick and inset from the sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The selection highlight for a menu item is a rounded rectangle that’s inset from the edges of the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshed AppKit controls — such as checkboxes, pop-up buttons, push buttons, and segmented controls — emphasize simplicity and boldness, harmonizing with iOS controls while maintaining familiar appearances. When you use standard AppKit controls in your app, you shouldn’t have to adjust your interface to adopt the new appearances. The exception is the slider, which is taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Slider&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;macOS 11 (default)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;macOS 10.15 and earlier (default)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Without tick marks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Regular&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Small&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15pt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mini&lt;/td&gt;

The thumb is a narrow white lozenge shape that's taller than the tick marks. As the thumb moves to the right, the track and the tick marks fill with blue color. The Double-click slider is set to the ninth tick mark out of eleven and the Spring-loading slider is set to the sixth tick mark out of eleven.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center scale&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in macOS 11, the track of a slider with tick marks aligns with the center of the thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in macOS 11, SF Pro is available as a variable font. The variable font format delivers a single package that includes the glyphs for all supported weights — such as regular, bold, and ultralight — in both uprights and italics. The variable format also supports optical sizing, which is a way to interpolate between glyphs to create size-specific versions of SF Pro to fit every design. Optical sizing replaces the need for the fixed-range Text and Display variants of SF Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS 11 also introduces support for the full range of text styles, such as body, headline, and callout. Dynamic Type is not available in macOS 11. For guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/typography/&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;widgets&quot;&gt;Widgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A widget elevates a small amount of useful content from your app in a beautiful, glanceable way. In macOS 11, you can create widgets in small, medium, and large sizes; people choose the size they want when they add your widget to Notification Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also create widgets for iOS and iPadOS. For guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/widgets/&quot;&gt;Widgets&lt;/a&gt;; for developer guidance, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit&quot;&gt;WidgetKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A/B Street: A simulation game to fix Seattle&amp;#039;s traffic</title>
<link>https://abstreet.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://abstreet.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever been on a bus stuck in traffic, wondering why there are cars parked on the road instead of a bus lane? A/B Street is a game exploring how small changes to a city affect the movement of drivers, cyclists, transit users, and pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show, don't tell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxPD4n_1-LU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alpha release trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roadmap and contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for current work, including ways to help. If you want to bring this to your city or if you're skilled in design, traffic simulation, data visualization, or civic/government outreach, please contact Dustin Carlino at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dabreegster@gmail.com&quot;&gt;dabreegster@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/abstreet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;r/abstreet&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CarlinoDustin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@CarlinoDustin&lt;/a&gt; for occasional videos of recent progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fix some traffic problem while playing A/B Street, my ultimate goal is for your changes to become a real proposal for adjusting Seattle's infrastructure. A/B Street is of course a game, using a simplified approach to traffic modeling, so city governments still have to evaluate proposals using their existing methods. A/B Street is intended as a conversation starter and tool to communicate ideas with interactive visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not leave city planning to professionals? People are local experts on the small slice of the city they interact with daily -- the one left turn lane that always backs up or a certain set of poorly timed walk signals. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtech.com/data/SimCities-Can-City-Planning-Mistakes-Be-Avoided-Through-Data-Driven-Simulations.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Laura Adler&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only with simple, accessible simulation programs can citizens become active generators of their own urban visions, not just passive recipients of options laid out by government officials.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing urban planning software is either proprietary or hard to use. A/B Street strives to set the accessibility bar high, by being a fun, engaging game. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/docs/motivations.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft is shutting down Mixer and partnering with Facebook Gaming</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;3dFe2R&quot;&gt;Microsoft is closing its Mixer service on July 22nd and plans to move existing partners over to Facebook Gaming. The surprise announcement means Mixer partners and streamers will be transitioned to Facebook Gaming starting today, and Microsoft will no longer operate Mixer as a service in a month’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cq6DDH&quot;&gt;Microsoft has struggled to reach the scale needed for Mixer to compete with Twitch, YouTube, and even Facebook Gaming which has led to today’s decision. “We started pretty far behind, in terms of where Mixer’s monthly active viewers were compared to some of the big players out there,” says Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s head of gaming, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think the Mixer community is really going to benefit from the broad audience that Facebook has through their properties, and the abilities to reach gamers in a very seamless way through the social platform Facebook has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ICqd5G&quot;&gt;Microsoft is partnering with Facebook to transition existing Mixer viewers and streamers over to Facebook Gaming in the coming weeks. On July 22nd, all Mixer sites and apps will automatically redirect to Facebook Gaming. Existing Mixer Partners will be granted partner status with Facebook Gaming, and any streamers using the Mixer monetization program will be granted eligibility for Facebook’s Level Up program. Mixer viewers with outstanding Ember balances, channel subscriptions, or Mixer Pro subscriptions will receive Xbox gift card credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;QbizRb&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s choice to partner with Facebook is clearly a strategic one that’s also related to broadening the appeal of its upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964434/microsoft-xcloud-preview-ps4-controller-windows-10-support-2020&quot;&gt;xCloud game streaming service&lt;/a&gt; and its overall gaming efforts. Microsoft will work closely with Facebook to bring xCloud to Facebook Gaming, allowing viewers to click and immediately play games that people are streaming. It’s a vision that’s very similar to Google’s ambitions with Stadia, but Mixer has lacked the scale and viewership to truly deliver this more broadly. Microsoft recruited exclusive streamers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930647/twitch-shroud-mixer-microsoft-ninja-amazon-exclusive&quot;&gt;Ninja and Shroud with big deals&lt;/a&gt;, but they haven’t been enough to get more people using the service over rivals. Ninja, Shroud, and other top streamers are now free to rejoin Twitch or stream on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tMuAxx&quot;&gt;Microsoft faced a decision between ditching Mixer, selling it off, or even investing more money in without a guarantee it would hit the scale it needs to compete. “It wasn’t as much about return on sell, it was about finding a partnership that was the best things for the community and streamers,” explains Spencer&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “We think this is it, and it gives us a great place to launch more xCloud content and give gamers the ability to play from there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;31egHQ&quot;&gt;Microsoft has talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17123452/microsoft-gaming-cloud-xbox-future&quot;&gt;reaching 2 billion gamers with its vision for xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, but Mixer wasn’t in a strong enough position to help achieve that goal. “When we think about xCloud and the opportunity to unlock gameplay for 2 billion players, we know it’s going be critically important that our services find large audiences and Facebook clearly gives us that opportunity,” says Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;ggBXzI&quot;&gt;It’s not clear exactly when we’ll see xCloud show up in Facebook Gaming, but it’s a key part of this new partnership. Microsoft is getting ready to launch xCloud streaming generally later this year, as part of the company’s Xbox Game Pass offering. “I don’t think we’re going to have to wait too long to see the outcome of the collaboration between the two companies to enable this tech for Facebook Gaming viewers,” reveals Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6CR27L&quot;&gt;We’ve seen Microsoft give up on services in the past like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16401898/microsoft-groove-music-pass-discontinued-spotify-partner&quot;&gt;Groove Music and partner with Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but that partnership wasn’t exactly super close or meaningful to end users. Spencer sees this as the beginning of opportunities around gaming for Microsoft and Facebook. “The teams are physically actually close to each other, we’ve been to each other’s offices,” says Spencer. “You’ll see us continuing to grow this relationship... this will be the beginning of us seeing future opportunity together. I think we have a lot of alignment between the organizations on areas where the industry is going and how we can help each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RIiXbs&quot;&gt;Microsoft will now keep hold of the technology that has powered Mixer and supported collaborative and low-latency streaming features. Microsoft Teams will start to use part of this Mixer technology in the future to improve real-time interactivity and low-latency streaming, and the Mixer developers involved in this will remain at Microsoft to help with the work on Teams. “Applying these fan-centric capabilities to new productivity experiences will create immersive ways for Teams to empower people, teams, and organizations to better engage in virtual gatherings at work and school,” says Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple announces it will switch to its own processors for future Macs</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;RSALhT&quot;&gt;Apple is officially moving to its own silicon chips for some of its Mac hardware. Calling it a “historic day for the Mac,” Apple CEO Tim Cook detailed the transitions to PowerPC, Mac OS X, and the move to Intel chips before unveiling its plans to use Apple’s own ARM-powered silicon in Macs in the future. It’s a big move that means macOS will support native iOS apps and macOS apps side by side on these new machines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ne3llM&quot;&gt;Apple will release the first Mac with Apple silicon at the end of this year, and it expects the transition to take two years. New Intel-powered Macs are still in the pipeline, so Apple isn’t moving exclusively to ARM-based Macs just yet. Still, this is a big shift for Apple to move away from Intel-based silicon in Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ouQJAs&quot;&gt;The biggest addition this move to ARM-powered chips brings is the ability for iOS and iPadOS apps to run natively on macOS in the future. “Most apps will just work,” says Apple, meaning you’ll be able to run native macOS apps alongside native iOS apps side by side for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;WRn4AU&quot;&gt;Apple is promising new levels of performance and far less power consumption with its move to in-house processors. Apple is designing its own range of SoC for Macs, with features unique to Mac. The common ARM-based architecture across Apple’s products should now make it easier for developers to write and optimize apps across every major Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EVLMQe&quot;&gt;Apple’s own pro apps will be updated to support the company’s new silicon in macOS Big Sur, and the company is hoping developers will update their apps. “The vast majority of developers can get their apps up and running in a matter of days,” claims Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hZjn6I&quot;&gt;Microsoft is working on Office updates for the new Mac silicon, and Word and Excel are already running natively on the new Mac processors, with PowerPoint even using Apple’s Metal tech for rendering. Apple has also been working with Adobe to get these pro apps up and running on these new chips. Apple demonstrated Lightroom and Photoshop running on the company’s new Macs, with a 5GB Photoshop PSD running natively with smooth animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;7PsSpN&quot;&gt;macOS Big Sur will also include a new version of Rosetta. Apple used Rosetta previously for the PowerPC shift to Intel-based Macs, and Rosetta 2 will automatically translate existing apps at install time. This means that even if developers haven’t fully updated their apps, they should still work without modification. Apple is also using virtualization for running versions of Linux on these new Macs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;6d0vvO&quot;&gt;Apple is launching a new “quick start” program for developers with documentation and sample code, and offering access to labs around the world to help transition existing apps to Apple’s own silicon. Developers will also be able to get access to a Developer Transition Kit in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299275/apple-mac-mini-developer-transition-kit-silicon-chip-wwdc-2020&quot;&gt;Mac mini enclosure&lt;/a&gt; with Apple’s A12Z chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;IOUSPh&quot;&gt;Apple’s move to its own ARM chips comes just as the company unveils macOS Big Sur, which includes a big redesign of macOS and features updates to the Messages and Maps built-in apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;87Ce1d&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232441/apple-arm-mac-2020-5nm-processor-12-cores&quot;&gt;Recent reports&lt;/a&gt; have suggested Apple’s move to ARM has been prompted by Intel’s slowing performance gains. Apple has reportedly been testing ARM-based chips in Macs and found big performance increases over Intel alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QHjJOa&quot;&gt;Apple’s transition to ARM follows a similar move by Microsoft to experiment with Windows on ARM nearly a decade ago. Microsoft started this work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2832683/microsoft-windows-8-intel-arm-new-hardware&quot;&gt;ahead of the Windows 8 release in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and even released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/16/2953379/windows-on-arm-officially-named-windows-rt-joins-windows-8-and&quot;&gt;Windows RT operating system&lt;/a&gt; that was designed for ARM-based hardware. Microsoft has since transitioned Windows 10 to ARM and worked with Qualcomm to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs&quot;&gt;integrate a custom SQ1 processor&lt;/a&gt; into its Surface Pro X device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xtmBb6&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This article originally misidentified the hardware for the Developer Transition Kit. We have updated the article to accurately state it is has a Mac mini enclosure. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iOS 14 will let you change your default email and web browser apps</title>
<link>https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/22/ios-14-default-apps/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/22/ios-14-default-apps/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of iOS 14’s new features, users will be able to switch their default app preferences for the first time. Details are scarce currently, but one of the slides in the WWDC presentation featured a block that announced users will be able to change their default browser and default email app. This is a long-requested feature, as iOS 13 and prior versions of the operating system will always direct taps on links to Safari, and new emails start in Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll bring more information on these changes soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-652489&quot;/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle author_ad&quot; data-ad-host=&quot;ca-host-pub-5506057612223327&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-7309997969756803&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default app options arrive as Apple faces increased scrutiny from antitrust bodies about having monopolistic control over the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default apps will be available with iOS 14 for iPhone and iPadOS 14 for iPad users. Other iOS 14 features include home screen widgets, a new Translate app, contextual Siri and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reflections on Being a Female Founder</title>
<link>https://tracy.posthaven.com/reflections-on-being-a-female-founder</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tracy.posthaven.com/reflections-on-being-a-female-founder</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not a lot is written about being a female founder and CEO. I used to believe that my journey as a startup founder was the same as any other founder's experience, regardless of gender, in that it is lonely and hard. I believed the same when I worked in construction. At the time, any questions about there being a difference felt deeply unnecessary to me. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W0EmEf4RDc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;snarky answer&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 at TechCrunch Disrupt: “When Tracy wakes up every morning, Tracy doesn’t think ‘Oh, I am a female.’ When I wake up in the morning I think ‘Wow, I’ve got a lot of work to do. I better get showered, caffeined up, and get my ass to work.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, I am the daughter of refugees, first to be born in America. The minority part of my identity I understood well, having witnessed my immigrant parents grinding their nose to the stone without ever complaining, so their children could have a better life. I was proud to be their child. The female part of my identity, however, was hidden under plain masculine clothes and behind a stoic demeanor. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be taken seriously as a CEO and I perceived any attention to my gender as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when I became pregnant in 2017, my opinion changed. Women have different lived experiences than men, and not acknowledging this would be a disservice to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day I learned I was pregnant, I also learned that one of our tech executives left his laptop on his desk, and would not be coming back to work. I remember the highest level of excitement I have ever felt, finally pregnant after trying for almost a year, and within a few hours, I swung to one of my lowest moments as a CEO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that I must be the worst leader for someone to just leave me like this. That night, I vomited into my sink and cried sloppily in the dark. Someone I trusted had snuck out of responsibility in the most selfish way imaginable, and my body responded with intense physical reactions. I wondered if male CEOs would have reacted this way. I wish I knew. By morning, I kicked off an executive search, filled in as leader for the department, and announced my decision to the team. One thing I learned during this time was to not waste turbulence. As part of the shocking announcement of our executive’s sudden departure, I also made a bunch of decisions that I previously lacked the courage to make and rolled everything out at once. There were major people and product roadmap changes, budget and schedule cuts all in the span of a few weeks. Our team had many questions, followed by many emotions and opinions about our new R&amp;amp;D direction. Some team members, including great engineers, quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional roller coasters seem to be law in startups, and I believe managing our own emotions is a big part of the job. What I have found is that I cannot stop myself from being human, but I can practice dialing down the duration of negative feelings like anger, fear, and sadness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my baby belly began to show, I told my leadership team we were expecting, and by the end of day most at the company knew too. There are no secrets in a startup. One colleague told me the next day that she knew I was pregnant because she saw me eat two bagels. That conversation made me realize that team members are always keeping an eye on their founders and leaders. In some cases, I do believe my coworkers genuinely cared for me. In most cases, I believe they were evaluating how well the company was doing based on my actions throughout the day and that factored into whether or not they should answer all the recruiters’ calls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months before I was due to give birth, I got a message from the CEO of a large competitor who had enough cash to acquire us. There was M&amp;amp;A activity in our industry, and, I too, wanted the option for our startup to become acquired. I was to give a presentation to several of their CxOs (a strong indicator that they were not just kicking the tires). In my own office, it never bothered me that my team’s eyes would sometimes wander to my basketball shaped belly during conversation, but it did get under my skin when these strangers, who I was negotiating with, looked at my stomach during this presentation. But that was mostly my own insecurities, something I would learn to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months prior to giving birth, we received a disappointing M&amp;amp;A term sheet, so we declined. There were more problems in the company that I could no longer ignore, and because there was a baby in my belly, I could not use social drugs to escape from my stress, and was stone cold sober through all of it. I needed to make another leadership change. Some of our board directors told me: “We support your decision, but let’s wait until you come back from maternity leave”, to which I obliged. Although I understood the rationality of their advice, I felt trembling anger for not being supported in that moment. I’ve also come to hate the phrase- “bad breath is better than no breath”, because it is terrible advice. My biggest regrets in business involve keeping the wrong person in the company for too long. I knew in my stomach that it was not going to work every time, I would even dread having unproductive 1-1s with them, but I would come up with excuses like- “I know they can’t stay, but I’m so stressed out right now.” The fact is, I hired the wrong person, I failed to help them grow as a leader and I owed it to my team and company to fix my mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into labor the same night of our first user conference. The weeks leading up to the conference, watching our whole company burn late night candles in preparation for our new product unveiling, I wondered how many male CEOs would skip their conference for the birth of their child? I assume most would. I kept reasoning with myself that if I wasn’t pregnant, there would be no question whether I’d be there or not, so I must be there. Forcing myself to parade my 9-month pregnancy, deliver the keynote, support our team, and work the halls as the host, was my way of feeling like a superwoman, which was mostly about rubbing my own ego. I arrived home around 8pm that evening, and my water broke immediately. I would hear my son’s first cry 32-hours later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one told me how hard breastfeeding would be. Like clockwork, every 2-3 hours a tiny mouth latched onto me for 20 minutes, resulting in raw and bloody nipples. The amount of time and effort it requires to breastfeed doesn't stop there. You'll also need to make time to eat an extra 500 calories each day, time to pump and wait for milk to slowly drain out of each breast, and then time to clean each pumping piece thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the M&amp;amp;A deal fell through, I was concerned that two of our largest competitors were coming together. I was determined to get back to work as soon as possible and fundraise a war chest to fight back. However, being only 4 weeks postpartum, I was still healing. And by healing I mean I was still bleeding from several tears in my vagina from pushing out a baby. Even something as natural as emptying my bladder felt debilitating. When my son was 6 weeks old, I handed him over to his nanny (a vetted stranger, really) and went back to work. I wiped tears from my eyes as I drove away, convincing myself that the company needed me more than my son. In reality, waiting a few more weeks for my return would not have made a difference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, I ask myself why I rushed back to work when I wasn’t ready. And I think I was scared. Not because our business was in trouble. We had two years of runway in the bank and our interim CEO (our CFO) and the team were running the business just fine. I think I was scared of what others might think of me as a new mother and CEO, maybe because of my own insecurities, maybe because of the societal norms ingrained in me. I pressured myself into proving that I was as dedicated to PlanGrid as I always have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would spend the next two months driving to VC’s offices, and down to Sand Hill Road, to secure our war chest. Despite this full schedule and constant traveling, I needed to pump milk. But I never asked to use any investor’s Mother’s Room. On some days, I would park my car on a sleepy street in Palo Alto and pump milk with a silicone hand pump in front of someone’s nice house, reading profiles of the investors in my next meeting from my iPhone. Occasionally someone would drive up, or a jogger would run by, and I would feel completely humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always hated fundraising. It's putting our hearts and souls on a platter for money and for smiling strangers to poke holes in us. However, PlanGrid could not have fueled growth the way we did without selling pieces of it to investors who took a chance on us. I often get asked about how it was to fundraise as a woman. I’ve heard awful stories firsthand from friends. Horrific stories like being offered a term sheet if sex was involved. Thankfully, that was not my experience. I believe I am in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are bad apples in every industry, but it is especially prevalent in those that control so much money and power. We tried to time all of our fundraising for when we were in a position of strength with attractive revenue growth and enough money in the bank to walk away from any or no deal. I also fundraised with my co-founders, and in later rounds with my CFO. I think it is easier for predators to target their prey when they are alone. I was never alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a dozen no’s to our Series-C fundraising, and a few weeks before we planned on stopping fundraising all together, we secured a round. We then received a revised M&amp;amp;A offer to purchase our company at a much higher price.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our job as founders and CEOs is to maximize all options for the company and choose the best path forward for our team and customers. A part of me wanted to stay CEO of PlanGrid forever. I grew up at PlanGrid. I watched one of my co-founders die of cancer during PlanGrid. I married another one of my co-founders and we became parents together. My self worth was completely tied to the company. PlanGrid gave me purpose and fulfillment. However, in fall of 2018, the best option for our company given the competitive and market risks, and our own internal challenges, was to sell our company to an incumbent with obvious technical synergies, for over 10x multiple on revenue. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-TEq-oKgeA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;So we did&lt;/a&gt;. The day we announced the sale to our team was the most frightened I have ever felt in my life. I was afraid that I had let our team down by selling, but they didn’t see it that way. That night, we celebrated together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contract with our acquirers was set to last 18 months. The plan included 12 months to run PlanGrid as a standalone company (or try to), and 6 months to fully integrate into the mothership. Everything that made me a good founder, made me a terrible employee at a public company. I was used to having complete autonomy in leading PlanGrid. As a startup, we would make changes quickly. We could take dozens of small bets and risks every quarter. Depending on those results, we would abandon or make larger bets in the direction that was working. Risk taking is much more limited at a public company, in part because they must report to Wall Street every 3 months. At a larger company there are also more dependencies, it felt like I couldn’t sneeze without asking permission from the heads of five other departments. New leadership took good care of our team and products, and people were nice to me, but it was obvious I was unhappy there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after the acquisition, I became pregnant for the second time. And shortly after I found out, I also had a miscarriage. While with my team, I felt it slip out of me. I went to the bathroom and I knew exactly what it was. I walked back out to the group pretending as if nothing happened. For the next few months, I grieved, fighting back tears almost every hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women's experience can be really hard - I went through infertility, pregnancy, birth, miscarriage all the while trying to balance being a good leader, good mother and good partner. To top it all off, I felt I had to be a version of what I thought a good male CEO was, so that I wouldn’t be judged or treated differently. It would take me years before I realized how delusional I was. I became a better and happier leader by being honest in who I was, even if it meant feeling raw heart pounding discomfort most days. And it turns out, my female identity was much more important to me than I realized going in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry has a long way to go toward gender equality in the workplace. The first step to change is acknowledging that things need to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer employed by the company that acquired us. I posted on LinkedIn that my watch has ended. I have much more time to read about the world we live in and who is controlling it. When I look at leadership across companies, and leadership across countries, it looks predominantly male. And that means our world is missing out on a lot of hardworking, self-identifying women who can improve it. The problems of our time are overwhelming and massive. In the midst of a pandemic and too many crises, our women leaders are proving they are great at leading and getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see a world where men and women, who make up equal halves of humanity, also make up equal halves of leadership. When that happens, I wholeheartedly believe that the entire world will benefit. We owe it to our sons and daughters to work hard to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt; to Nina Achadjian, Maria Alegre, Andrea Barrica, Ralph Gootee, Kat Manalac, Madison McKay, Kristina Milian, Sarah Moon, and Strat Sherman for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Andrew Yang&amp;#039;s Data Dividend Project is pushing Big Tech to pay users for data</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298919/andrew-yang-big-tech-data-dividend-project-facebook-google-ubi</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298919/andrew-yang-big-tech-data-dividend-project-facebook-google-ubi</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;nvy6RX&quot;&gt;Andrew Yang wants people to get paid for the data they create on big tech platforms like Facebook and Google, and with a new project launching on Monday, he believes he can make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xKDKrs&quot;&gt;Yang’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddpforall.com/&quot;&gt;Data Dividend Project&lt;/a&gt; is a new program tasked with establishing data-as-property rights under privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) all across the country. The program hopes to mobilize over 1 million people by the end of the year, focusing primarily on Californians, and “pave the way for a future in which all Americans can claim their data as a property right and receive payment” if they choose to share their data with platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;LQcGCS&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are completely outgunned by tech companies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tVoF8Q&quot;&gt;At the beginning of the year, the CCPA went into effect, granting consumers new control over their data online like the right to delete and opt out of the sale of their personal information. There’s nothing in the law about tech companies paying for data (or, more specifically, paying them not to opt out), but Yang’s new project is looking to show that the idea is popular with voters. The Data Dividend Project is betting on collective action as a means of changing the law and extending data property rights to users across the country. If this idea becomes law, Yang’s team says it will work on behalf of users to help them get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q4KdCF&quot;&gt;“We are completely outgunned by tech companies,” Yang told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re just presented with these terms and conditions. No one ever reads them. You just click on them and hope for the best. And unfortunately, the best has not happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dTBZEE&quot;&gt;Lawmakers like Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) have introduced legislation in the past that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2019/3/sen-john-kennedy-r-la-introduces-social-media-data-privacy-legislation&quot;&gt;grant people property rights&lt;/a&gt; over the data they generate online, but all measures like it have failed to gain much momentum in Congress. Some people fear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/&quot;&gt;data ownership is the wrong approach&lt;/a&gt; to protecting user privacy online and only incentivizes users to sell away their privacy instead of protecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8syFWP&quot;&gt;“It’s a question that our lawmakers have been essentially absent from,” Yang said. “I think there are even better arrangements that we should be pushing for legislatively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yqmXae&quot;&gt;The project’s signup form asks for people to put in all of the email addresses they use online to help identify how many platforms are currently profiting off of an individual’s data. It also asks for users to provide their PayPal information so any money that could eventually be gained from platforms could be deposited directly into a user’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Lne1B2&quot;&gt;Users getting paid for the data they create is a popular idea among some tech thinkers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358680/who-owns-the-future-jaron-lanier-thinks-google-and-the-government&quot;&gt;like Jaron Lanier&lt;/a&gt;, someone Yang says he’s been influenced by. Facebook already pays some users for data but only under specific circumstances. Last year, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661595/facebook-study-app-monitor-phone-usage-pay&quot;&gt;launched its Study app&lt;/a&gt; that paid users who allowed the company to monitor the features they used and the time they spent on the platform. Earlier this year, Facebook even offered to pay some users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145584/facebook-pay-record-voice-speech-recognition-viewpoints-proununciations-app&quot;&gt;for voice recordings&lt;/a&gt; to help improve its speech recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9M1Owp&quot;&gt;But Yang’s Data Dividend Project wants to take data payment further by grounding it in the law, not just something platforms occasionally do for specific services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VZvasx&quot;&gt;“It’s that first day that people get paid their dividend through DDP for All is going to be such a great day because you can imagine thousands and even tens of thousands of Americans getting something in their PayPal or Cash App,” Yang said. “Even something like $20, $50, or $100, and they’ll tell their friends, and we can change practices industry-wide.”&lt;/p&gt;
