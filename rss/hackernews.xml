<title>Who’s behind Wednesday’s epic Twitter hack?</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; was thrown into chaos on Wednesday after accounts for some of the world’s most recognizable public figures, executives and celebrities starting tweeting out links to bitcoin scams. Twitter says the attack happened because someone tricked or coerced an employee into providing access to internal Twitter administrative tools. This post is an attempt to lay out some of the timeline of this attack, and point to clues about who may have been behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first public signs of the intrusion came around 3 PM EST, when the Twitter account for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684900753/Statement-on-Twitter-Breach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tweeted a message&lt;/a&gt; saying it had partnered with “CryptoForHealth” to give back 5000 bitcoin to the community, with a link where people could donate or send money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes after that, similar tweets went out from the accounts of other cryptocurrency exchanges, and from the Twitter accounts for democratic presidential candidate &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;President Barak Obama&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt;, former New York Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/strong&gt; and investment mogul &lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-52296&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bezos-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;553&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may sound ridiculous that anyone would be fooled into sending bitcoin in response to these tweets, an analysis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=31&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the BTC wallet&lt;/a&gt; promoted by many of the hacked Twitter profiles shows that on July 15 the account processed 383 transactions and received almost 13 bitcoin on July 15 — or approximately USD $117,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591846464233474&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it detected “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools. We know they used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf. We’re looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed and will share more here as we have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are strong indications that this attack was perpetrated by individuals who’ve traditionally specialized in hijacking social media accounts via “&lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;,” an increasingly rampant form of crime that involves bribing, hacking or coercing employees at mobile phone and social media companies into providing access to a target’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People within the SIM swapping community are obsessed with hijacking so-called “OG” social media accounts. Short for “original gangster,” OG accounts typically are those with short account names (such as @B or @joe). Possession of these OG accounts confers a measure of status and perceived influence and wealth in SIM swapping circles, as such accounts can often fetch thousands of dollars when resold in the underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Wednesday’s attack on Twitter, there were signs that some actors in the SIM swapping community were selling the ability to change an email address tied to any Twitter account. In a post on OGusers — &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ogusers&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a forum dedicated to account hijacking&lt;/a&gt; — a user named “&lt;strong&gt;Chaewon&lt;/strong&gt;” advertised they could change email address tied to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account for $250, and provide direct access to accounts for between $2,000 and $3,000 apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52281&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52281&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-52281&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon.png 1518w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon-580x316.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon-940x511.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chaewon-768x418.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52281&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The OGUsers forum user “Chaewon” taking requests to modify the email address tied to any twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is NOT a method, you will be given a full refund if for any reason you aren’t given the email/@, however if it is revered/suspended I will not be held accountable,” Chaewon wrote in their sales thread, which was titled “Pulling email for any Twitter/Taking Requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before any of the Twitter accounts for cryptocurrency platforms or public figures began blasting out bitcoin scams on Wednesday, the attackers appear to have focused their attention on hijacking a handful of OG accounts, including “&lt;strong&gt;@6.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Twitter account was formerly owned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/adrian-lamo-homeless-hacker-who-turned-in-chelsea-manning-dead-at-37/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Adrian Lamo&lt;/a&gt; — the now-deceased “homeless hacker” perhaps best known for breaking into the New York Times’s network and for reporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chelsea Manning&lt;/a&gt;‘s theft of classified documents. @6 is now controlled by Lamo’s longtime friend, a security researcher and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;phone phreaker&lt;/a&gt; who asked to be identified in this story only by his Twitter nickname, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucky225/status/1283525414896320512?s=19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucky225&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky225 said that just before 2 p.m. EST on Wednesday, he received a password reset confirmation code via Google Voice for the @6 Twitter account. Lucky said he’d previously disabled SMS notifications as a means of receiving multi-factor codes from Twitter, opting instead to have one-time codes generated by a mobile authentication app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the attackers were able to change the email address tied to the @6 account and disable multi-factor authentication, the one-time authentication code was sent to both his Google Voice account &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to the new email address added by the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way the attack worked was that within Twitter’s admin tools, apparently you can update the email address of any Twitter user, and it does this without sending any kind of notification to the user,” Lucky told KrebsOnSecurity. “So [the attackers] could avoid detection by updating the email address on the account first, and then turning off 2FA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky said he still hasn’t been able to review whether any tweets were sent from his account during the time it was hijacked because he still doesn’t have access to it (he has put together a breakdown of the entire episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lucky225/the-twitter-hack-what-exactly-happened-d8740d33c1c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;at this Medium post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But around the same time @6 was hijacked, another OG account – &lt;strong&gt;@B&lt;/strong&gt; — was swiped. Someone then began tweeting out pictures of Twitter’s internal tools panel showing the @B account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52282&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52282&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-52282&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/atb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52282&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A screenshot of the hijacked OG Twitter account “@B,” shows the hijackers logged in to Twitter’s internal account tools interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter responded by removing any tweets across its platform that included screenshots of its internal tools, and in some cases temporarily suspended the ability of those accounts to tweet further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Twitter account — &lt;strong&gt;@shinji&lt;/strong&gt; — also was tweeting out screenshots of Twitter’s internal tools. Minutes before Twitter terminated the @shinji account, it was seen publishing a tweet saying “follow @6,” referring to the account hijacked from Lucky225.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52283&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-r.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52283&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-52283&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-r.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-r.png 651w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-r-580x373.png 580w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52283&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The account “@shinji” tweeting a screenshot of Twitter’s internal tools interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cached copies of @Shinji’s tweets prior to Wednesday’s attack on Twitter are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/Abr3l&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.vn/YGS0T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;. Those caches show Shinji claims ownership of two OG accounts on Instagram — “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/j0e/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;j0e&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/dead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity heard from a source who works in security at one of the largest U.S.-based mobile carriers, who said the “j0e” and “dead” Instagram accounts are tied to a notorious SIM swapper who goes by the nickname “&lt;strong&gt;PlugWalkJoe&lt;/strong&gt;.” Investigators have been tracking PlugWalkJoe because he is thought to have been involved in multiple SIM swapping attacks over the years that preceded high-dollar bitcoin heists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52288&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52288&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-52288&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-archive1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-archive1.png 591w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinji-archive1-580x379.png 580w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52288&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Archived copies of the @Shinji account on twitter shows one of Joe’s OG Instagram accounts, “Dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now look at the profile image in the other Archive.org index of the @shinji Twitter account (pictured below). It is the same image as the one included in the @Shinji screenshot above from Wednesday in which Joseph/@Shinji was tweeting out pictures of Twitter’s internal tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52292&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52292&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-52292&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinjo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinjo.png 693w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shinjo-580x282.png 580w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52292&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Image: Archive.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individual, the source said, was a key participant in a group of SIM swappers that adopted the nickname “&lt;strong&gt;ChucklingSquad&lt;/strong&gt;,” and was thought to be behind the hijacking of &lt;strong&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&lt;/strong&gt;‘s Twitter account last year. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wired.com recounted&lt;/a&gt;, @jack was hijacked after the attackers conducted a SIM swap attack against &lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;, the mobile provider for the phone number tied to Dorsey’s Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_52286&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-52286&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-52286&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jack-tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;553&quot; height=&quot;571&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-52286&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A tweet sent out from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s account while it was hijacked shouted out to PlugWalkJoe and other Chuckling Squad members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile industry security source told KrebsOnSecurity that PlugWalkJoe in real life is a 21-year-old from Liverpool, U.K. named &lt;strong&gt;Joseph James Connor&lt;/strong&gt;. The source said PlugWalkJoe is in Spain where he was attending a university until earlier this year. He added that PlugWalkJoe has been unable to return home on account of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile industry source said PlugWalkJoe was the subject of an investigation in which a female investigator was hired to strike up a conversation with PlugWalkJoe and convince him to agree to a video chat. The source further explained that a video which they recorded of that chat showed a distinctive swimming pool in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that same source, the pool pictured on PlugWalkJoe’s Instagram account (instagram.com/j0e) is the same one they saw in their video chat with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-52293&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/j0epool.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;489&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/j0epool.png 943w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/j0epool-580x474.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/j0epool-940x768.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/j0epool-768x627.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PlugWalkJoe was in fact pivotal to this Twitter compromise, it’s perhaps fitting that he was identified in part via social engineering. Maybe we should all be grateful the perpetrators of this attack on Twitter did not set their sights on more ambitious aims, such as disrupting an election or the stock market, or attempting to start a war by issuing false, inflammatory tweets from world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it seems clear that this Twitter hack could have let the attackers view the direct messages of anyone on Twitter, information that is difficult to put a price on but which nevertheless would be of great interest to a variety of parties, from nation states to corporate spies and blackmailers.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr took aim at Hollywood companies, including Walt Disney Co (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_DIS.N_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/DIS.N&quot;&gt;DIS.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) on Thursday as well as large technology firms like Apple, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp over company actions with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the (Chinese Communist party),” Barr said. He added that Hollywood has routinely caved into pressure and censored their films “to appease the Chinese Communist Party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. Apple declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day,” Barr said in a speech at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barr chided U.S. companies for being too willing to take steps to ensure access to the large Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report,” Barr said. “America’s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barr’s was the latest attack on China from President Donald Trump’s administration before his November re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, U.S.-China ties have dipped to their lowest ebb in decades, strained over issues ranging from the global coronavirus pandemic and China’s massive trade surpluses, to Beijing’s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, its military buildup in the South China Sea and treatment of minority Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barr suggested that Apple iPhones “wouldn’t be sold (in China) if they were impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities.” He suggested American tech companies were imposing a “double standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barr noted after China imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong, Facebook, Google, Twitter In and LinkedIn, announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party’s corrupt and dictatorial rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No, you couldn&amp;#039;t have made more money than the Twitter hacker</title>
<link>https://fortenf.org/e/security/2020/07/15/twitter-hack.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fortenf.org/e/security/2020/07/15/twitter-hack.html</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;Jul 15, 2020&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;make as much money as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. What should you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back” on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) &lt;em&gt;don’t actually send 2 BTC back&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They managed to run off with a little over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2&quot;&gt;$100,000&lt;/a&gt; before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stock-market-manipulation&quot;&gt;Stock Market Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; readability=&quot;8.5760869565217&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. &quot;i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving,&quot; i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note&lt;/p&gt;
— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blackmail&quot;&gt;Blackmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers got &lt;em&gt;full access&lt;/em&gt; to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack&quot;&gt;Sony leaks&lt;/a&gt; or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q&quot;&gt;Tom Scott video&lt;/a&gt; about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sell-it-on-the-dark-web&quot;&gt;Sell it on the dark web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence agencies want &lt;em&gt;persistent&lt;/em&gt; access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bug-bounty&quot;&gt;Bug Bounty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894&quot;&gt;routinely&lt;/a&gt; pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; readability=&quot;2.6506024096386&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;🤔 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/I902KoaZwe&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos&quot;&gt;has emerged&lt;/a&gt;, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;phishing&quot;&gt;Phishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html&quot;&gt;relay phishing attack&lt;/a&gt; that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://safebrowsing.google.com/&quot;&gt;Safe Browsing&lt;/a&gt; list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; readability=&quot;6.5900900900901&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zulip 3.0: Threaded Open Source Team Chat</title>
<link>https://blog.zulip.com/2020/07/16/zulip-3-0-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.zulip.com/2020/07/16/zulip-3-0-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 3.0, containing hundreds of new features and bug fixes to help distributed and remote teams stay productive and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/&quot;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; is the open-source threaded team chat app, used by thousands of teams globally. Zulip’s unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/why-zulip/&quot;&gt;topic-based threading experience&lt;/a&gt; combines the immediacy of real-time chat with the asynchronous efficiency of email-style threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png&quot; class=&quot;image-wide-only&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png&quot; class=&quot;image-narrow-only&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/&quot;&gt;the Zulip server project&lt;/a&gt; to 619 distinct code contributors. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/team&quot;&gt;54 people&lt;/a&gt; who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html&quot;&gt;chat.zulip.org&lt;/a&gt;, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-highlights&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work.  It's been incredibly gratifying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html&quot;&gt;hear from users&lt;/a&gt; about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful.  We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/for/open-source/&quot;&gt;open-source projects&lt;/a&gt;, non-profits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/for/research/&quot;&gt;research groups&lt;/a&gt;, and similar non-commercial organizations.  New organizations can apply during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/new&quot;&gt;signup flow&lt;/a&gt; or on the billing page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip Cloud has introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/&quot;&gt;60-day free trials&lt;/a&gt; for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip.  Zulip has robust data import tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter&quot;&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip has a new logo! Constructed from two chat bubbles that together form a Z (with a second Z in the negative space between them!), it replaces our aging “green Z inside a circle” logo created in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1000w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our primary domain is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com&quot;&gt;https://zulip.com&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be migrating organizations from &lt;code&gt;subdomain.zulipchat.com&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;subdomain.zulip.com&lt;/code&gt; in the coming weeks, taking care to avoid breaking existing API integrations and permalinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Zulip mobile apps for iOS and Android have fixed numerous bugs and gained features like displaying math formulas with LaTeX—a frequently requested feature for the many organizations who do machine learning or other work best expressed in the language of mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re having an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4652389204754432/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; this year, with 18 amazing students spending their summer working on Zulip. Many of the features advertised here and in our full changelog were built by current GSoC students or alumni of the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;release-highlights&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is such a huge release, just listing the hundreds of important changes in this release makes our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; incredibly long. Here are just some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core user experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859150872_image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Stream descriptions can contain Zulip markdown such as links, emoji, and even LaTeX!
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added “Recent Topics”, a useful new interface for browsing conversations. Feedback so far has been extremely positive, and we plan to make a version of this the default view in Zulip Server 4.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 891w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Essentially every widget in the Zulip UI received significant polish work in this release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message formatting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip has an innovative new feature for scheduling meetings with global participants. Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;use a date picker to write a time&lt;/a&gt; which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip’s markup now supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;spoiler blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Quote-and-reply&lt;/a&gt; now generates a handy link to the referenced message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;upgrading the operating system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;upgrade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API and API Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/api&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;REST API documentation&lt;/a&gt; received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/api/changelog&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;a detailed API changelog&lt;/a&gt; which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The &lt;code&gt;zulip_feature_level&lt;/code&gt; field in &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;the server settings API&lt;/a&gt; (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports. This should make it easier for developers (including developers of the official desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) to write full-featured client apps directly off of the API documentation, without needing to investigate server internals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documenting the API provided a natural audit of Zulip’s API for obscure quirks and mistakes that would be better cleaned up than documented. As a result, this release contains dozens of changes to the Zulip API, which had previously been quite stable for years. Because of careful backwards-compatibility work, these shouldn’t cause any disruption (Zulip mobile app releases from 6 months ago work unmodified against this release!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New external authentication method integrations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#plug-and-play-sso-google-github-gitlab&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#sign-in-with-apple&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Sign in with Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Zulip desktop apps now do social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.) via an external browser, which improves security and provides a more pleasant single sign-on experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;a new incoming webhook API&lt;/a&gt; that accepts messages in the format used by Slack’s incoming webhooks API. This means that some third-party products that integrate with Slack but don’t have a generic outgoing-webhook feature can now easily integrate with Zulip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/authentication-methods.html#saml&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Zulip’s popular SAML integration&lt;/a&gt; now supports login initiated from the SAML Identity Provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BigBlueButton joins Jitsi and Zoom as a supported video call provider. We also rewrote the Zoom integration to have a much better OAuth user experience. The Google Hangouts video call integration was removed due to Google Hangouts reaching end of life. (Its replacement, Google Meet, does not offer a similar API for third-party apps to create calls.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;New native integrations&lt;/a&gt; for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Prometheus Alertmanager, with improvements to the integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, Taiga, Semaphore, and many more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip now uses the &lt;code&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; CSS property to determine whether to default to the day theme or the popular night theme, based on the operating system’s theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip’s notification settings UI has been redesigned around an intuitive table format, displaying all individual streams that have non-default settings. This makes it much easier to configure, and is also important preparation for upcoming features like subscribing to notifications on a topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859186960_image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zulip now has complete or nearly-complete translations for 16 languages: Chinese, Czech, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Ukrainian, as well as English. Another 8 languages have partial translations which cover the majority of the strings in the project: Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Polish, and Swedish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip’s missed-message emails, one of the last parts of the Zulip core experience that was not yet internationalized, are now tagged for translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; for dozens of other notable improvements, including new features, performance optimizations, and bug fixes. If you administer a Zulip server, we encourage you to read at least the list of added features at the top, since there are a number of useful new settings introduced in this release that you may want to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highly recommend upgrading, since this release is a big improvement over previous releases. You can upgrade as usual by following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;upgrade instructions&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#upgrade-notes&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;upgrade notes section of the changelog&lt;/a&gt; for some changes you’ll want to understand before upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many installations have already upgraded to release candidates, so we feel very confident in this release. But if you need help, best-effort support is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;chat.zulip.org&lt;/a&gt;. You can also purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulipchat.com/plans/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;commercial support&lt;/a&gt; from the Zulip core team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take this opportunity to advertise a few opportunities to contribute back to Zulip:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter is at its best when verified accounts can’t tweet</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-unverified-takeover/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-unverified-takeover/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lead-in-text-callout&quot;&gt;In 1998, folk&lt;/span&gt; singer Jewel released a book of poetry called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Night-Without-Armor-Jewel/dp/0061073628&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Night-Without-Armor-Jewel/dp/0061073628&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Night Without Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (The title was a pun, you see. It plays with the homophones “night” and “knight” ... Oh, you do see? OK, never mind.) It wasn’t particularly mind-blowing—at best, it featured what you’d expect from a master of the inoffensive coffeehouse jam—but it sold &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/books/best-sellers-august-16-1998.html&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/books/best-sellers-august-16-1998.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot of copies&lt;/a&gt;. Jewel was at the height of her Lilith Fair-and-VH1-powered stardom, and the book seemed to be at every Barnes &amp;amp; Noble coast to coast. Like the boy bands and pop stars who would come after her, she outsold Rilke that year (probably), because she was a name everyone knew. Monoculture was strong in ’98. My point—&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Point-Do-Have-One/dp/0553384228&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Point-Do-Have-One/dp/0553384228&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;and I do have one&lt;/a&gt;—is that pop culture back then wasn’t much different then than it is now. These days, though, the chart-toppers, the people everyone listens to most, are the people with the blue checkmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, those people with the blue checks, those “verified” social media users, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-hacking-musk-obama-apple-biden-kanye/&quot;&gt;found themselves silenced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Elon Musk, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Barack Obama, and a host of other Twitter mega-users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-hacking-musk-obama-apple-biden-kanye/&quot;&gt;had their accounts compromised&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday afternoon in what appeared to be an attempt to pull off a bitcoin scam. To staunch the bleeding, Twitter blocked verified accounts from posting messages. Suddenly, many a Twitter blowhard was locked out; the drivers of conversation were muzzled, and the plebes had the controls. &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmanuelfelton/coronavirus-meme-nature-is-healing-we-are-the-virus&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmanuelfelton/coronavirus-meme-nature-is-healing-we-are-the-virus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nature was healing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a night, or at least a few hours, without checkmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it might be the best thing to happen on Twitter in a while. No, it wasn’t fun for the scores of users, including &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/wired&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wired&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WIRED&lt;/a&gt;, who feared for the safety of their accounts; it’s also horrifying to think of the magnitude of harm a hack like this could potentially bring. But for everyone else—the people who normally don’t wield the largest megaphones—it was paradise. Fewer self-important windbags; fewer politicians. Even news outlets were being locked out, and in the era of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/&quot;&gt;doomscrolling&lt;/a&gt;, this can be a blessing. There might’ve even been a minute there where President Trump couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Trump! It all felt like one of those sepia-toned dreams in an ’80s TV comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Muting ended pretty quickly, of course. By Wednesday night most of the verified accounts had returned. But for a brief period there, Twitter was ruled by the followers, not the followed. It felt like the old days, before Twitter became a service that swung elections, back when it was all a bunch of jerkoffs trying to make each other laugh in 140 characters or fewer. (Were we ever so young?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, even though this piece is drenched in nostalgia, this isn’t some corny attempt to look back with rose-colored glasses. (It is, however, an attempt to use a lot of cliches.) Twitter has always had good eggs and bad eggs—or at least it did &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/rip-twitter-egg&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/rip-twitter-egg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;until 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It’s consistently been a place for the sharing of wisdom and the airing of bad ideas. But the entire verification system has always felt a little off, like it gave some people’s thoughts and opinions more weight than others. To some, it was a literal status symbol. To others, it seemed like an endorsement from the platform—something that becomes an even bigger problem when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitters-authentication-policy-is-a-verified-mess/&quot;&gt;white supremacists get blue checks&lt;/a&gt;. And to nearly everybody, it creates an environment where the popular kids rule. On Wednesday, for a brief moment, all of that changed, and Twitter was better for it. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>On Wednesday, a hack involving high-profile Twitter accounts led the service to suspend the activity of verified users. It was great.</og:description>

<title>TSMC plans to halt chip supplies to Huawei in 2 months</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/TSMC-plans-to-halt-chip-supplies-to-Huawei-in-2-months</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/TSMC-plans-to-halt-chip-supplies-to-Huawei-in-2-months</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Taiwan-Semiconductor-Manufacturing-Co.-Ltd&quot;&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday confirmed it has suspended processing new orders from key customer Huawei Technologies to comply with U.S. export regulations, but said it can still achieve more than 20% revenue growth this year thanks to strong demand for 5G smartphones, infrastructure and high-performance computing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest contract chipmaker also said it is ramping up capital spending for 2020, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are complying fully with the new [U.S.] regulations. We did not take any new orders [from Huawei] since May 15,&quot; TSMC Chairman Mark Liu told an investors conference, confirming an &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/TSMC-halts-new-Huawei-orders-after-US-tightens-restrictions&quot;&gt;earlier report&lt;/a&gt; by the Nikkei Asian Review. &quot;Although the regulation just finished its public comment period, the BIS [Bureau of Industry and Security] did not make a final ruling change. Under this circumstance, we do not plan to ship wafers [to Huawei] after Sept. 14.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the tightened export control rule, non-U.S. chip companies must apply for licenses to use American technology and tools to supply to Huawei, the biggest Chinese tech company. TSMC and other chipmakers were not allowed to process new orders from Huawei or its chip design arm HiSilicon after May 15 without a license and must ship any orders already in the pipeline before Sept. 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu did not say whether TSMC plans to apply for licenses to ship to Huawei. A TSMC spokesperson said the chairman's comment is based on current rules, and it is not clear whether there will be any further regulation changes from the U.S. government, given that the comment period just ended a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said TSMC is working closely with other clients to make full use of the company's capacity. &quot;We are progressing relatively well in our capacity that has been left open,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC forecast its revenue for July-September could reach $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion, up more than 20.7% at the midpoint from a year ago, exceeding the market consensus of around 315.67 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.7 billion). The Taiwanese chip titan raised its revenue growth target to over 20% for all of 2020 and said it will further increase capital expenditure to up to $17 billion this year, from the previously planned $15 billion to $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry bellwether said its financial performance has proved resilient amid the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. clampdown on Huawei thanks to its diverse customer portfolio and tech leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC's revenue for April-June was NT$310.69 billion, or $10.38 billion, up 28.9% from a year ago, on the higher end of its forecast of up to $10.4 billion driven by the ongoing rollouts of 5G-related products and high-performance computers. The company's net profit surged 81% on the year to NT$120.82 billion, as the tech industry went through a rough 2019 that included weak iPhone demand in the first half and a normally slow second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, TSMC foresees the overall smartphone market declining more than 10% by units shipped in 2020, but CEO and Vice Chairman C.C. Wei said his company now expects the 5G smartphone penetration rate to reach the &quot;high teens&quot; thanks to a &quot;promising&quot; demand outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is slated to introduce its first 5G flagship iPhone lineup later this year, and is preparing up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-races-to-push-ahead-with-5G-iPhone-mass-production&quot;&gt;80 million units&lt;/a&gt; of new iPhones, Nikkei earlier reported. TSMC is not only the sole producer of iPhone mobile processor chips, it also supplies almost all the world's leading chip developers, including Qualcomm, Nvidia, Broadcom, ADI, MediaTek and NXP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TSMC also warned of uncertainties ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We see our customers having high anticipations and are preparing for 5G smartphone product launches. ... We cannot rule out the possibilities of inventory corrections in the future,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. &quot;We will have to wait to see how the sell-through goes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC has also been caught in the escalating U.S.-China tensions. The Taiwanese chip titan, which also makes military-grade semiconductors for American chip developer Xilinx for use in F-35 jets, in May announced its intention to build a $12 billion advanced chip facility in Arizona in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The resilience in the chip supply chain so far could be attributed to Huawei building more inventories out of fear it could not have key components later because of the U.S. ban ... while other companies are also building inventories a bit more as they anticipate gaining market share from Huawei later,&quot; said Mark Li, a veteran analyst with Bernstein Research. &quot;Apple, meanwhile, according to our supply chain checks, did not lower its orders because of COVID-19.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The uncertainties ahead would be starting from the latter part of the fourth quarter or next year, as people have to see whether the overall macroeconomic climate and the demand for electronic devices can continue to be robust,&quot; Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 1.45</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/07/16/Rust-1.45.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/07/16/Rust-1.45.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.45.0. Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.45.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot;&gt;rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1450-2020-07-16&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.45.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in 1.45.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two big changes to be aware of in Rust 1.45.0: a fix for some long-standing unsoundness when casting between integers and floats, and the stabilization of the final feature needed for one of the more popular web frameworks to work on stable Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing unsoundness in casts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184&quot;&gt;Issue 10184&lt;/a&gt; was originally opened back in October of 2013, a year and a half before Rust 1.0. As you may know, &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://llvm.org/&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;/a&gt; as a compiler backend. When you write code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;pub fn cast(x: f32) -&amp;gt; u8 {
    x as u8
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler in Rust 1.44.0 and before would produce LLVM-IR that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-llvm-ir&quot;&gt;define i8 @_ZN10playground4cast17h1bdf307357423fcfE(float %x) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = fptoui float %x to i8
  ret i8 %0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;fptoui&lt;/code&gt; implements the cast, it is short for &quot;floating point to unsigned integer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem here. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fptoui-to-instruction&quot;&gt;the docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘fptoui’ instruction converts its floating-point operand into the nearest (rounding towards zero) unsigned integer value. If the value cannot fit in ty2, the result is a poison value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, unless you happen to dig into the depths of compilers regularly, you may not understand what that means. It's full of jargon, but there's a simpler explanation: if you cast a floating point number that's large to an integer that's small, you get undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that this, for example, was not well-defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn cast(x: f32) -&amp;gt; u8 {
    x as u8
}

fn main() {
    let f = 300.0;

    let x = cast(f);

    println!(&quot;x: {}&quot;, x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Rust 1.44.0, this happens to print &quot;x: 0&quot; on my machine. But it could print anything, or do anything: this is undefined behavior. But we have no &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; code here. This is what we call a &quot;soundness&quot; bug, that is, it is a bug where the compiler does the wrong thing. We tag these bugs as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22I-unsound+%F0%9F%92%A5%22&quot;&gt;I-unsound&lt;/a&gt; on our issue tracker, and take them very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug took a long time to resolve, though. The reason is that it was very unclear what the correct path forward was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the decision was made to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; would perform a &quot;saturating cast&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; cast would be added if you wanted to skip the checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very similar to array access, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array[i]&lt;/code&gt; will check to make sure that &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; has at least &lt;code&gt;i + 1&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;unsafe { array.get_unchecked(i) }&lt;/code&gt; to skip the check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's a saturating cast? Let's look at a slightly modified example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn cast(x: f32) -&amp;gt; u8 {
    x as u8
}

fn main() {
    let too_big = 300.0;
    let too_small = -100.0;
    let nan = f32::NAN;

    println!(&quot;too_big_casted = {}&quot;, cast(too_big));
    println!(&quot;too_small_casted = {}&quot;, cast(too_small));
    println!(&quot;not_a_number_casted = {}&quot;, cast(nan));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;too_big_casted = 255
too_small_casted = 0
not_a_number_casted = 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, numbers that are too big turn into the largest possible value. Numbers that are too small produce the smallest possible value (which is zero). NaN produces zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new API to cast in an unsafe manner is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;let x: f32 = 1.0;
let y: u8 = unsafe { x.to_int_unchecked() };
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as always, you should only use this method as a last resort. Just like with array access, the compiler can often optimize the checks away, making the safe and unsafe versions equivalent when the compiler can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stabilizing function-like procedural macros in expressions, patterns, and statements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/10/25/Rust-1.30.0.html&quot;&gt;Rust 1.30.0&lt;/a&gt;, we stabilized &quot;function-like procedural macros in item position.&quot; For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.gnome.org/federico/gnome-class&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;gnome-class&lt;/code&gt; crate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnome-class is a procedural macro for Rust. Within the macro, we define a mini-language which looks as Rust-y as possible, and that has extensions to let you define GObject subclasses, their properties, signals, interface implementations, and the rest of GObject's features. The goal is to require no unsafe code on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;gobject_gen! {
    class MyClass: GObject {
        foo: Cell&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt;,
        bar: RefCell&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;,
    }

    impl MyClass {
        virtual fn my_virtual_method(&amp;amp;self, x: i32) {
            ... do something with x ...
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;in item position&quot; bit is some jargon, but basically what this means is that you could only invoke &lt;code&gt;gobject_gen!&lt;/code&gt; in certain places in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust 1.45.0 adds the ability to invoke procedural macros in three new places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;// imagine we have a procedural macro named &quot;mac&quot;

mac!(); // item position, this was what was stable before

// but these three are new:
fn main() {
  let expr = mac!(); // expression position

  match expr {
      mac!() =&amp;gt; {} // pattern position
  }

  mac!(); // statement position
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to use macros in more places is interesting, but there's another reason why many Rustaceans have been waiting for this feature for a long time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rocket.rs&quot;&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt;. Initially released in December of 2016, Rocket is a popular web framework for Rust often described as one of the best things the Rust ecosystem has to offer. Here's the &quot;hello world&quot; example from its upcoming release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get(&quot;/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;age&amp;gt;&quot;)]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -&amp;gt; String {
    format!(&quot;Hello, {} year old named {}!&quot;, age, name)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -&amp;gt; rocket::Rocket {
    rocket::ignite().mount(&quot;/hello&quot;, routes![hello])
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until today, Rocket depended on nightly-only features to deliver on its promise of flexibility and ergonomics. In fact, as can be seen on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rocket.rs/v0.4&quot;&gt;project's homepage&lt;/a&gt;, the same example above in the current version of Rocket requires the &lt;code&gt;proc_macro_hygiene&lt;/code&gt; feature to compile. However, as you may guess from the feature's name, today it ships in stable! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/19&quot;&gt;This issue&lt;/a&gt; tracked the history of nightly-only features in Rocket. Now, they're all checked off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next version of Rocket is still in the works, but when released, many folks will be very happy :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Library changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.45.0, the following APIs were stabilized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72413/&quot;&gt;use &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; with ranges&lt;/a&gt;, to iterate over codepoints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;for ch in 'a'..='z' {
    print!(&quot;{}&quot;, ch);
}
println!();
// Prints &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of changes, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1450-2020-07-16&quot;&gt;the full release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other changes in the Rust 1.45.0 release: check out what changed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1450-2020-07-16&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-145-2020-07-16&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-145&quot;&gt;Clippy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors to 1.45.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.45.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.45.0/&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When your coworker does great work, tell their manager</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/07/14/when-your-coworker-does-great-work-tell-their-manager/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/07/14/when-your-coworker-does-great-work-tell-their-manager/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking recently about anti-racism and what it looks like to support colleagues from underrepresented groups at work. The other day someone in a Slack group made an offhand comment that they’d sent a message to an engineer’s manager to say that the engineer was doing exceptional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work is a pretty common practice and it can be really helpful, but it’s easy to forget to do and I wish someone had suggested it to me earlier. So let’s talk about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1280918150289281025&quot;&gt;tweeted about this to ask how people approach it&lt;/a&gt; and as usual I got a ton of great replies that I’m going to summarize here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to talk about what to say, when to do this, and why you should ask first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-if-it-s-ok-first&quot;&gt;ask if it’s ok first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that at least 6 different people brought up was the importance of asking first. It might not be obvious why this is important at first — you’re saying something positive! What’s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some potential reasons saying something positive to someone’s manager could backfire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Giving someone a compliment that’s not in line with their current goals. For example, if your coworker is trying to focus on becoming a technical expert in their domain and you’re impressed with their project management skills, they might not want their project management highlighted (or vice versa!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving someone the wrong “level” of compliment. For example, if they’re a very senior engineer and you say something like “PERSON did SIMPLE_ROUTINE_TASK really well!” — that doesn’t reflect well on them and feels condescending. This can happen if you don’t know the person’s position or don’t understand the expectations for their role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your coworker was supposed to be focusing on a specific project, and you’re complimenting them for helping with something totally unrelated, their manager might think that they’re not focusing on their “real” work. One person mentioned that they got reprimanded by their manager for getting a spot peer bonus for helping someone on another team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people have terrible managers (for example, maybe the manager will feel threatened by your coworker excelling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people just don’t like being called out in that way, and are happy with the level of recognition they’re getting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall: a lot of people (for very good reasons!) want to have control over the kind of feedback their manager hears about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just ask first! (“hey, I was really impressed with your work on X project and wanted to send this note to $MANAGER to explain how important your work because I know she wasn’t that involved in X project and might not have seen everything you did, is that ok with you?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-it-s-important-to-highlight-work-that-isn-t-being-recognized&quot;&gt;when it’s important: to highlight work that isn’t being recognized&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now let’s talk about when this is important to do. I think this is pretty simple – managers don’t always see the work their reports are doing, and if someone is doing really amazing work that their manager isn’t seeing, they won’t get promoted as quickly. So it’s helpful to tell managers about work that they may not be seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of types of important work that might be underrecognized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;work by someone from another department (maybe their manager doesn’t understand how helpful their contribution was to the company because they don’t work with your team that much, but your coworker’s work made a huge difference!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work that happened in a private channel (for example if someone spent hours helping you with something 1:1 and it really made a big difference to the success of your project)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work preventing problems, which often isn’t as visible as firefighting work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work by people from underestimated groups (maybe your coworker’s work isn’t being recognized as much as it should be because of racism/sexism/etc!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documentation/code review/other kinds of work that aren’t always as visible as programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work by remotes (if remote work is less visible at your company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work by someone in a role that’s typically underrecognized (someone mentioned support as an example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, everyone agreed that it’s always great to highlight the contributions of more junior coworkers when they’re doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-it-matters-it-helps-managers-make-a-case-for-promotion&quot;&gt;why it matters: it helps managers make a case for promotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone to get promoted, they need evidence that they’ve been doing valuable work, and managers don’t always have the time to put together all that evidence. So it’s important to be proactive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can work on this for yourself by writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/&quot;&gt;brag document&lt;/a&gt;, but having statements from coworkers explaining how great your work really helps build credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So providing these statements for your coworkers can help them get recognized in a timely way for the great work they did (instead of getting promoted a year later or something). It’s extra helpful to do this if you know the person is up for promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-do-it-be-specific-explain-the-impact-of-their-work&quot;&gt;how to do it: be specific, explain the impact of their work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone agreed that it’s helpful to explain what specifically the person did that was awesome (“X did an incredible job of designing this system and we haven’t had any major operational issues with it in the 6 months since it launched, which is really unusual for a project of that scale”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-do-it-highlight-when-they-re-exceeding-expectations&quot;&gt;how to do it: highlight when they’re exceeding expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the point is to help people get promoted, it’s important to highlight when people are exceeding expectations for their level, for example if they’re not a senior engineer yet but they’re doing the kind of work you’d expect from a senior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-do-it-send-the-person-the-message-too&quot;&gt;how to do it: send the person the message too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already basically covered this in “ask the person first”, but especially if I’m using a feedback system where the person might not get the feedback immediately I like to send it to them directly as well. It’s nice for them to hear and they can also use it later on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-recognition-can-be-great-too&quot;&gt;public recognition can be great too!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of folks mentioned that they like to give public recognition, like mentioning how great a job someone did in a Slack channel or team meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two reasons public recognition can be good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps build credibility for your colleague&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It lets the person you’re recognizing be part of the conversation/reciprocate to the feedback-giver, especially if the work was a collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s good to ask about this before doing this – some people dislike public recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-peer-bonuses&quot;&gt;on peer bonuses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people who work at Google (or other companies with peer bonuses) mentioned that they prefer to give peer bonuses for this because it’s a more official form of recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people mentioned other forms of feedback systems that they use instead of email. Use whatever form of recognition is appropriate at your company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;anyone-can-do-this&quot;&gt;anyone can do this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this is it’s a way everyone can help their coworkers – even if you’re really new and don’t feel that qualified to comment on how effective someone more senior is at their job, you can still point out things like “this person helped me do a project that was really out of my comfort zone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;maybe-expand-the-set-of-people-you-do-this-for&quot;&gt;maybe expand the set of people you do this for!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s very common for people to promote the work of their friends in this way. I’ve tried to expand the set of people I do this for over time – I think it’s important to keep an eye out for coworkers who are really excelling and to make sure their work is recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-reading-on-sponsorship&quot;&gt;more reading on sponsorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to just talk about this one specific practice of telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work but there are a LOT of other ways you can help lift your coworkers up. Lara Hogan’s post &lt;a href=&quot;https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/&quot;&gt;what does sponsorship look like?&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of great examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mekka Okereke has a wonderful Twitter thread about another way you can support underrepresented folks: by being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552459873378304&quot;&gt;“difficulty anchor”&lt;/a&gt;. It’s short and definitely worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;thanks to Sher Minn Chong, Allie Jones, and Kamal Marhubi for reading a draft of this&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;THE INCREDIBLY STUPID ONE”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(SN HEGDAHL, USS CANBERRA – PRISONER OF WAR)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Dick “Beak” Stratton, Captain, USN (Ret.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a warmer than usual summer day in Clark, South Dakota when a rather large and ungainly young man, a recent high school graduate, set about finding his way in the world. The salivating Navy recruiter asked the youngster what it would take to have him sign up: “why, I’d like to go to Australia .” It was as good as done. After all, in 1966, if you were lucky enough to ship out on the USS Canberra, more likely than not, during the course of your hitch, there will be a port call to the ship’s namesake— Canberra , Australia .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This young man came from a solid, patriotic Norwegian Lutheran stock that believed when your country called, you answered. You did not go to the bus station but to the recruiting station. You did not go to Oxford , you went toVietnam. So Douglas Brent Hegdahl III shipped out to boot camp at San Diego , where he slept through the Code of Conduct lectures since he would not be fighting in the trenches. Lo and behold, he did get orders to the USSCanberra. At that time Canberra with 8-inch guns mounted on the pointy end and missiles on the round end was assigned to steam with the Gulf of Tonkin Yacht Club in the South China Sea off the coast of Vietnam . (And, yes, She did have Canberra, Australia on her Port of Call list.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug’s battle station was the aft ammunition handling room for the 5-inch guns, located aft in the bowels of the ship. One morning he had the 0100 watch while the Canberra was steaming down the coast of North Vietnam firing its 8-inch guns against targets of opportunity (bicycles, water buffalo and occasional trucks) on Highway 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;At about 0330 he rolled out of the rack. Being a prudent farm boy, he locked all his valuables in his locker and then proceeded to go out on deck for a breath of fresh air before manning his battle station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now there is a non-repetitive exercise in the surface Navy called “going out on deck when big guns are firing.” If the concussion does not blow you over the side, it will at least blow out your eardrums. But Doug must have slept through that safety lecture. He doesn’t know what happened. Either not being night-adapted, or being without his glasses, or concussion did it, he ended up going arse over teakettle into the South China Sea about three miles offshore with no life preserver, no identification, no nothing. Meanwhile he watched the Love Boat merrily steaming over the horizon, firing at the coastline and never missing him for two days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is not much to do in the South China Sea at 0345. He took off his boondockers and hung them around his neck in case he needed them when he reached shore. He stripped off his dungarees, zipped up the fly, tie off the cuffs and popped them over his head, as he was taught, to make a life preserver. He reports back to you that it doesn’t work. (He missed the part about old dungarees, with holes, out of the Lucky Bag would have to be kept wet if they were to hold any air at all.) So he put on his trousers, socks and shoes. (Sharks? Sea snakes?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Somewhere along the line he had heard that drowning was a “nice way to die;” so he thought he would try it out. He put his hands over his head and down he went—bloop, bloop, bloop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now both he and I had heard the myth that when drowning you would get cuddly, warm, all the nice things in your life would flash by in your mind and you would go to your eternal reward to the sound of music (harp?). Doug resurfaced and reports back to us that it is all malarkey: there are no movies, there is no music and it’s colder than Hell!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As dawn came he started swimming away from the sun, hopefully towards shore. He could see the haze of land, but the harder he tried, the further back it receded. So he just rolled on his back, playing like a whale, humming a few tunes and saying a few prayers. Notice he never gave up. How many people have we been exposed to in the course of our lives, in a situation like that would have just plain given up? About 1800 that same day, a Vietnamese fishing boat came by and hauled him out of the water—some twelve hours later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even those peasant fishermen could figure out that this moose would never fit in the cockpit of an A4 Skylark. They turned him upside down and inside out which garnered them absolutely nothing. Remember, he had prudently left everything back on the ship in his locker. Picture yourself being tortured to admit you were a CIA agent who entered the water in Coronado , California to swim ten thousand miles across the Pacific to infiltrate their shores!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the authorities got him ashore, they showed Doug piles of materials allegedly written by Yankee Air Pirates who had been captured before him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(95% of those captured in North Vietnam had been tortured, were not offered the option of death, and were made to give more than Name, Rank, Serial Number and Date of Birth sequence permitted by the Military Code of Conduct and required by International Law.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug recognized that something was amiss, but, as he said later, “Geeze, they’re officers, they must know what they are doing.” So he decided his best ploy was to pretend to be stupid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He got them off target by comparing farms in North Vietnam and South Dakota . He didn’t realize that even then the Communists were categorizing him to gauge his usefulness to their cause. His dad had about ten motel units, numberless vehicles and all kinds of land—but no water buffalo. No water buffalo meant in Vietnamese parlance that he was a “poor peasant.” This is just as well, as Communists had murdered over 20 million “rich peasants” in their various revolutions, because those folks are unreconstructed capitalists. A little miffed at first, Doug caught on right away—he is a quick study—it was to his advantage to play out the poor peasant act to the bitter end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tired of the verbal jousting the Communist cadres told him that he would have to write and anti-war statement for them. He joyously agreed. The interrogators were dumbfounded. This was the first Yankee to agree to do anything without being tortured first. They brought out the paper, ink and pens. He admired them all and then stated: “But one small thing. I can’t read or write. I’m a poor peasant.” This was quite credible to the Vietnamese since their poor peasants could neither read nor write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So they assigned a Vietnamese to teach him penmanship, spelling, grammar and sentence structure. Immediately his learning curve went flat. Eventually, the interrogators gave up in disgust; writing a confession for him and having him sign it in an illegible scrawl. He admitted to the war crime of shelling the presidential birthplace of Ho Chi Minh and signed it as Seaman Apprentice Douglas Brent Hegdahl III, United States Navy Reserve, Commanding Officer, USS Canberra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one has ever seen this piece of paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug was shuffled around from pillar to post, since his captors didn’t know where he would fit into their propaganda plans. One mistake they made was to put him in for a while with Joe Crecca, an Air Force officer who had developed a method of creating the most organized memory bank we possessed to record the names of pilots shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam . Joe took this young Seaman and, recognizing the potential, painstakingly taught Doug not only 256 names, but also, the method of memorizing, cross-referencing and retrieving those names. It was no easy task that Joe set for himself for it was not intuitively obvious to Doug the value of such mental gymnastics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a hot summer day when I first met Doug. I was in solitary confinement again. The Communists did not care for me, which was OK because I didn’t like them either. My cell door opened and here was this big moose standing in his skivvie shorts (prison uniform of the day). “My name is Seaman Douglas Brent Hegdahl, Sir. What’s yours?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; It is awful hard to look dignified when you are standing in your underwear, knock-kneed, ding-toed, pot-bellied, unwashed and unshaven for 100 days. I automatically recited, “Dick Stratton, Lieutenant Commander, USSTiconderoga.” Immediately I saw that I probably made a mistake as his eyes rolled back in his head and you could see what he was thinking: “Cripes, another officer!” But notice that instinctively he asked the critical and most important question for survival: “Who is your senior?” The rule we lived by was: “If I am senior, I will take charge; if junior, I will obey.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Communists took a siesta for two hours every afternoon which was a good deal for us as we were free from torture and harassment. I was laying on the floor on my bed board and Doug was skipping, yes, skipping around the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked: “Doug, what are you doing?” He paused for a moment, looked me in the eye and cryptically said: “Skipping, Sir” and continued to skip. A stupid question, a stupid answer. After a moment, I again queried: “What ya doin’ that for?” This stopped him for a moment. He paused and cocked his head thoughtfully, smiled and replied: “You got anything better to do,Sir?” I didn’t. He continued skipping. I guess he did learn one thing from boot camp. You can say anything you want to an officer as long as you smile and say “sir.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One siesta period he said: Hey, Beak, you went to college and studied government; do you know the GettysburgAddress?” We got a brick (no paper or pencils for the criminals) and started to write it out on the tile floor until we got it correct. Then he stopped me with the question: “Can you say it backwards?” Well, who would want to say theGettysburg Address backwards? Certainly not the Jesuits at Georgetown and especially not me. Doug could say it backwards, verbatim, rapidly. I know because I could track him from the written version we had on the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So what?” you might say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The so what is that when they threw him out of Vietnam, and throw him out they did, he came out with 256 names that Joe Crecca had taught him memorized by service, by rank and alphabetically; next to each name he had a dog’s name, kid’s name or social security number to verify the quality of the name which we had picked up by tap code, deaf spelling code or secret notes. He still has those names memorized today and sings them to the tune of “Old MacDonald Has a Farm.” One of our intelligence officers asked him if he could slow the recitation down to make for easier copying. Doug replied “No” that it was like riding a bike, you had to keep moving or you would fall off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it weren’t for Joe Crecca, Doug and our government would not have had those names until the end of war five years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In trying to get people to accept early propaganda releases, the Communists would have some “good cop” interrogator like the ones we called the “Soft Soap Fairy” talk to the prospect and sound him out for pliability. They got Doug one day and asked what we eventually learned to be the lead question: “What do you want more than anything else in the world?” The answer of the weak and willing was : “To go home to my family.” Doug thought for a long time, then cocked his head with a smile and said&amp;gt; “Why, I’d like a pillow, Sir.” This was not an unreasonable response since we had no pillows on our cement pads or bed boards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the response sure confounded the enemy. They eventually came up with a name for Doug amongst the guards and interrogators: “The Incredibly Stupid One.” His original resistance ploy had paid off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because they thought him stupid, they would let him go out in the cell block courtyard during the siesta to sweep up the grounds period monitored by only one sleepy, peasant guard. I thought that was great since it kept him from skipping and I could get some rest. However, curiosity got the better of me and I started to watch him through a peephole we had bored in the cell door. He’d go sweeping and humming until the guard was lulled to sleep. Then Doug would back up to a truck, spin the gas cap off the standpipe, stoop down and put a small amount (“Small, because it’s going to be a long war, Sir.”) of dirt in the gas tank and replace the cap. I watched him over a period of time do this to five trucks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I’m a liberal arts major who shot himself down, so all I can do is report what I saw. There were five trucks working in the prison; I saw Doug work on five trucks; I saw five trucks towed disabled out of the prison camp. Doug Hegdahl, a high school graduate from the mess decks fell off a ship and has five enemy trucks to his credit. I am a World Famous Golden Dragon (VA 192) with two college degrees, 2000 jet hours, 300 carrier landings and 22 combat missions. How many enemy trucks do I have to my credit? Zero. Zip. Nada. De Rien. 0. Who’s the better man? Douglas Brent Hegdahl, one of two men I know of who destroyed enemy military equipment while a prisoner of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later on, Doug, having left his eyeglasses on board Canberra , discovered that he had difficulty linking up isolated cell blocks throughout the prison compound with his defective distance vision. So he went to the authorities and asked if he could read some of their propaganda. They were delighted. Here was a prisoner, without being tortured, volunteering to read their swill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then Doug cautioned them with his: “Small thing [They never learn]; I cannot read without glasses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So they trolled out a dime store clerk who fitted him with glasses by trying one on after the other until Doug said he could see. His near vision was OK. Unbeknownst to the clerk, he was fitting Doug for distance vision, Now, in between sweeps and gas tanks he was able to link up cell blocks not only by sweeping in code but now also using the deaf spelling code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Vietnamese were big on token propaganda releases of prisoners to make various peace groups look good and our government look impotent. They would try to pick people who had not been tortured or in jail long enough to look emaciated. Usually they were volunteers, violators of direct orders from their Seniors and traitors to our cause of resistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These releases always were of three at a time. The magic of the number three was always a mystery to us. As our leaders exercised greater internal communications and controls, it became harder for the Communists to make up a propaganda release party. Seeking to round out the number they finally turned to “The Incredibly Stupid One” who, although not volunteering, was certainly too dumb to do them any harm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of this conditioning they had both Doug and I examined by “the Doctor.” This was a female soldier we saw through a peephole we had in the door get briefed up and then dolled up like a physician. The physician made a grand entrance worthy of a world-famous brain surgeon. The effect was somewhat spoiled by the face mask protecting her chin rather than covering her mouth; she really had no ideas what the face mask was for. The exam, after looking in all the holes in your head and listening your heart, consisted of “feeling you up” under the guise of palpitating your internal organs while the translator asked, “The Doctor wants to know if you miss your wife (girlfriend)? Wouldn’t you like to be with her now?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then they would pull Doug out for interrogations sounding him out for an early release. They told him not to tell me as I was an officer who did not care about his welfare like they did. They informed him: “Stratton would never even speak to you if you were in America .” Doug would come back from each go around and immediately tell me everything that was said. One time he plaintively asked: “Beak, you’d speak to me if we’re home now, wouldn’t you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They started to try to fatten us up with large bowls of potatoes laced with canned meat. No one else in the prison was getting it. As a result I told Doug we couldn’t take it. We could either not touch it and turn it back in; in which case the guards would eat it. Or we could dump it in the slop bucket so that no one could eat it without getting sick. Doug thought this was a bit on the scrupulous side, but went along with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I told the Camp Commander that under no condition would I accept an early release even if offered and if they threw me out I’d have to be dragged feet first all the way from Hanoi to Hawaii screaming bloody murder all the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was time to cut to the chase. Doug would have to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug did not want to go. We finally told Doug that as long as he did not have to commit treason, he was to permit himself to be thrown out of the country. He was the most junior. He had the names. He knew firsthand the torture stories behind many of the propaganda pictures and news releases. He knew the locations of many of the prisons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a direct order; he had no choice. I know, because I personally relayed that order to him as his immediate senior in the chain of command.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well throw him out they did. The 256 names he had memorized contained many names that our government did not have. He ended up being sent to Paris by Ross Perot to confront the North Vietnamese Peace Talk Delegation about the fate of the Missing in Action. He entered the Civil Service and is today a Survival School instructor for the U.S. Navy and the James B. Stockdale Survival, Evasion, Resistance, And Escape Center (SERE), naval Air Station, North Island, Coronado, California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And yes, he can still recite those names!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can watch him do it on the Discovery Channel special on Vietnam POWs—Stories of Survival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A while after Doug had been released, I was called over to an interrogation. It was to be a Soft Soap Fairy kind of gig since there were quality cigarettes, sugared tea in china cups, cookies and candy laid out on the interrogation table. A dapper, handsome Vietnamese, dressed in an expensive, tailored suit and wearing real, spit-shined wingtip shoes, came into the room with a serious look on his face—all business. “Do you know Douglas Hegdahl?” “You know I do.” “Hegdahl says that you were tortured.” “This is true.” “You lie.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling up the sleeves to my striped pajamas (prison mess dress uniform), I pointed to the scars on my wrists and elbows and challenged: “Ask your people how these marks got on my body; they certainly are neither birth defects or the result of an aircraft accident.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He examined the scars closely, sat back, stared and stated: “You are indeed the most unfortunate of the unfortunate.” With that he left the interrogation leaving me with all the goodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon release I compared notes with Doug and we determined that time frame was the same time he accused the Vietnamese in Paris of murdering me [I had not written home once writing became voluntary] for embarrassing them in a Life magazine bowing picture. T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hanks to Doug, despite the scars on my body, the Communists had to produce me alive at the end of the war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Incredibly Stupid One,” my personal hero, is the archetype of the innovative, resourceful and courageous American Sailor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These sailors are the products of the neighborhoods, churches, schools and families working together to produce individuals blessed with a sense of humor and the gift of freedom who can overcome any kind of odds. These sailors are tremendously loyal and devoted to their units and their leaders in their own private and personal ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As long as we have the Dougs of this world, our country will retain its freedoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s avoid talk of ‘chemical imbalance’: it’s people in distress</title>
<link>https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Jenna discovered&lt;/strong&gt; that her boyfriend was cheating on her, she went into an emotional tailspin. She was ‘crying all the time’, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadn’t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldn’t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was ‘real’ – brought on by a physiological force external to her volition – and that it showed she’s not ‘just a slacker’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, ‘crazy’ or ‘nuts’. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasn’t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an ‘illness’ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as ‘that’s what the doctor calls it’ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience – what I have called a ‘third condition’. The people we spoke to did not give this ‘condition’ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the perspective&lt;/strong&gt; of another of our interviewees, a young woman I’ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When ‘you think mental illness’, according to Piper, ‘you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and I’m not crazy, I just get really nervous.’ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just ‘a little off’. She has ‘too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issues’. Distinct from ‘crazy people’, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her ‘condition’ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an ‘imbalance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;The ‘crazy people’ are shadowy, depersonalised figures – the damaged, uncontrolled ‘other’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, ‘all you have to do is take a pill’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. I’ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patients’ stories, is often presented as a ‘real medical condition’ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as ‘mental illness’ or ‘mental disorder’, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the ‘crazy people’ are shadowy, depersonalised figures – the damaged, uncontrolled ‘other’ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: ‘The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain – your body’s most important organ.’ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become ‘literate’, with a ‘more scientific’ even ‘sophisticated’ understanding of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners – as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others – hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are ‘just like’ other chronic physical ailments, such as ‘heart disease or diabetes’, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, ‘well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformly’ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by ‘biogenetic attribution of all mental disorders’, has ‘not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnesses’. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;general public&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What accounts for this paradoxical result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that&lt;/strong&gt; our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically &lt;em&gt;caused.&lt;/em&gt; Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans – and countless others in Western countries – likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;The idea that one’s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I argue in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chemically Imbalanced&lt;/em&gt; (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesn’t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as ‘chemical imbalance’. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remains&lt;/a&gt; a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the very notion that to be ‘real’, mental suffering must equate with some kind of physiological malfunction is deeply misguided. Dropping this reductionist premise could restore the deeper questions of phenomenological experience and meaning. What makes the difficult experience feel the way it does? How does the experience induce shame or anxiety or disappointment? How are people’s experiences connected to their relations with others and the world around them, and how are these relations disrupted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that one’s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction. The idea that it explains first-person experience or that it offers some exemption from responsibility is a fiction as well. As the interviews made clear, people adopted the biogenetic account because they thought it was based in science. The interviews also show how this account undermines the kinds of introspection and self-examination that can lead to meaningful self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health treatment needs to re-engage with the language of persons. This means suspending the detached, third-person stance toward patients, and attending to their actual experience and circumstances. And it means encouraging patients themselves to avoid this stance and draw on the normal ways that people make sense of their emotions and actions. In this everyday language, we intuitively refer to intentions and desires and a person’s reasons for thinking, acting or feeling as they do. When explaining difficult experience, we don’t ordinarily speak of causation or mechanisms but presuppose of our own action and that of others some degree of freedom and control, and we pay attention to relationships, history and social context, such as adverse events, confounding circumstances or unrealised dreams. Even episodes of psychopathology can be explored in the language of persons, as when psychologists speak of hallucinations, delusions, compulsions and so on. Unlike the mechanical picture of a brain misfiring, this language permits a form of understanding that can bring unusual and challenging mental states into conversation with a person’s relation to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering this interpretive conversation means sharply circumscribing if not dropping biogenetic talk. It means seeking understanding, which is what people dealing with emotional suffering, like those we interviewed, yearn for. An understanding as persons, embodied and situated in a life-world. An understanding that is the enemy of fear and requires no othering.&lt;/p&gt;
