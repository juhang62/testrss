<title>Simdjson – Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second</title>
<link>https://github.com/lemire/simdjson</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/lemire/simdjson</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A C++ library to see how fast we can parse JSON with complete validation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON documents are everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a lot of time parsing these documents. We want to accelerate the parsing of JSON per se using commonly available SIMD instructions as much as possible while doing full validation (including character encoding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some performance results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a quarter or fewer instructions than a state-of-the-art parser like RapidJSON, and half as many as sajson. To our knowledge, simdjson is the first fully-validating JSON parser to run at gigabytes per second on commodity processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/lemire/simdjson/blob/master/doc/gbps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/lemire/simdjson/raw/master/doc/gbps.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a skylake processor, the parsing speeds (in GB/s) of various processors on the twitter.json file are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;parser&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;GB/s&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;simdjson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;RapidJSON encoding-validation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;RapidJSON encoding-validation, insitu&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.71&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;sajson (insitu, dynamic)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;sajson (insitu, static)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.97&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;dropbox&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;fastjson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gason&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ultrajson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;jsmn&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;cJSON&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We support platforms like Linux or macOS, as well as Windows through Visual Studio 2017 or better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A processor with AVX2 (i.e., Intel processors starting with the Haswell microarchitecture released 2013, and processors from AMD starting with the Rizen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recent C++ compiler (e.g., GNU GCC or LLVM CLANG or Visual Studio 2017), we assume C++17. GNU GCC 7 or better or LLVM's clang 6 or better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some benchmark scripts assume bash and other common utilities, but they are optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is made available under the Apache License 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Windows, we build some tools using the windows/dirent_portable.h file (which is outside our library code): it under the liberal (business-friendly) MIT license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;simdjson/jsonparser.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

/...

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * filename = ... &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; use whatever means you want to get a string of you JSON document&lt;/span&gt;
std::string_view p = get_corpus(filename);
ParsedJson pj;
pj.allocateCapacity(p.size()); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; allocate memory for parsing up to p.size() bytes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; is_ok = json_parse(p, pj); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; do the parsing, return false on error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; parsing is done!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; You can safely delete the string content&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;*)p.data());
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; the ParsedJson document can be used here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; js can be reused with other json_parse calls.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to use a simplier API if you do not mind having the overhead of memory allocation with each new JSON document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;simdjson/jsonparser.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

/...

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * filename = ... &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
std::string_view p = get_corpus(filename);
ParsedJson pj = build_parsed_json(p); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; do the parsing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; you no longer need p at this point, can do aligned_free((void*)p.data())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;( ! pj.isValid() ) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; something went wrong&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage: easy single-header version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &quot;singleheader&quot; repository for a single header version. See the included file &quot;amalgamation_demo.cpp&quot; for usage. This requires no specific build system: just copy the files in your project in your include path. You can then include them quite simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;iostream&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;simdjson.h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;simdjson.cpp&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; argc, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *argv[]) {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * filename = argv[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]; 
  std::string_view p = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;get_corpus&lt;/span&gt;(filename);
  ParsedJson pj = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;build_parsed_json&lt;/span&gt;(p); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; do the parsing&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;( ! pj.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;() ) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;not valid&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
  } &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;valid&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
  }
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In some settings, it might be desirable to precompile &lt;code&gt;simdjson.cpp&lt;/code&gt; instead of including it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage (old-school Makefile on platforms like Linux or macOS)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements: recent clang or gcc, and make. We recommend at least GNU GCC/G++ 7 or LLVM clang 6. A system like Linux or macOS is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make
make test
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make parse
./parse jsonexamples/twitter.json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Linux, the &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; command gives a detailed analysis of the performance counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run comparative benchmarks (with other parsers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make benchmark
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage (CMake on platforms like Linux or macOS)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements: We require a recent version of cmake. On macOS, the easiest way to install cmake might be to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; and then type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install cmake&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxbrew.sh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;equivalent brew on Linux which works the same way as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a recent compiler like clang or gcc. We recommend at least GNU GCC/G++ 7 or LLVM clang 6. For example, you can install a recent compiler with brew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install gcc@8
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional: You need to tell cmake which compiler you wish to use by setting the CC and CXX variables. Under bash, you can do so with commands such as &lt;code&gt;export CC=gcc-7&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;export CXX=g++-7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building: While in the project repository, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMake will build a library. By default, it builds a shared library (e.g., libsimdjson.so on Linux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can build a static library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir buildstatic
cd buildstatic
cmake -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=ON ..
make 
make test
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may want to specify your compiler, especially if the default compiler on your system is too old. You may proceed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install gcc@8
mkdir build
cd build
export CXX=g++-8 CC=gcc-8
cmake ..
make
make test
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage (CMake on Windows using Visual Studio)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assuming that you have a common Windows PC with at least Visual Studio 2017, and an x64 processor with AVX2 support (2013 Haswell or better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grab the simdjosn code from GitHub, e.g., by cloning it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmake.org/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CMake&lt;/a&gt;. When you install it, make sure to ask that &lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; be made available from the command line. Please choose a recent version of cmake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a subdirectory within simdjson, such as &lt;code&gt;VisualStudio&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a shell, go to this newly created directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 ..&lt;/code&gt; in the shell while in the &lt;code&gt;VisualStudio&lt;/code&gt; repository. (Alternatively, if you want to build a DLL, you may use the command line &lt;code&gt;cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=OFF ..&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This last command created a Visual Studio solution file in the newly created directory (e.g., &lt;code&gt;simdjson.sln&lt;/code&gt;). Open this file in Visual Studio. You should now be able to build the project and run the tests. For example, in the &lt;code&gt;Solution Explorer&lt;/code&gt; window (available from the &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; menu), right-click &lt;code&gt;ALL_BUILD&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Build&lt;/code&gt;. To test the code, still in the &lt;code&gt;Solution Explorer&lt;/code&gt; window, select &lt;code&gt;RUN_TESTS&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;json2json mydoc.json&lt;/code&gt; parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps back the result to standard output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;json2json -d mydoc.json&lt;/code&gt; parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps model (as a tape) to standard output. The tape format is described in the accompanying file &lt;code&gt;tape.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;minify mydoc.json&lt;/code&gt; minifies the JSON document, outputting the result to standard output. Minifying means to remove the unneeded white space charaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a fast parser. It fully validates the input according to the various specifications. The parser builds a useful immutable (read-only) DOM (document-object model) which can be later accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the engineering, we make some assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We support UTF-8 (and thus ASCII), nothing else (no Latin, no UTF-16). We do not believe that this is a genuine limitation in the sense that we do not think that there is any serious application that needs to process JSON data without an ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We store strings as NULL terminated C strings. Thus we implicitly assume that you do not include a NULL character within your string, which is allowed technically speaking if you escape it (\u0000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assume AVX2 support which is available in all recent mainstream x86 processors produced by AMD and Intel. No support for non-x86 processors is included though it can be done. We plan to support ARM processors (help is invited).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cases of failure, we just report a failure without any indication as to the nature of the problem. (This can be easily improved without affecting performance.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As allowed by the specification, we allow repeated keys within an object (other parsers like sajson do the same).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance is optimized for JSON documents spanning at least a few kilobytes up to many megabytes: the performance issues with having to parse many tiny JSON documents or one truly enormous JSON document are different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not aim to provide a general-purpose JSON library.&lt;/em&gt; A library like RapidJSON offers much more than just parsing, it helps you generate JSON and offers various other convenient functions. We merely parse the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The input string is unmodified. (Parsers like sajson and RapidJSON use the input string as a buffer.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We parse integers and floating-point numbers as separate types which allows us to support large 64-bit integers in [-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775808), like a Java &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; or a C/C++ &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;. Among the parsers that differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers, not all support 64-bit integers. (For example, sajson rejects JSON files with integers larger than or equal to 2147483648. RapidJSON will parse a file containing an overly long integer like 18446744073709551616 as a floating-point number.) When we cannot represent exactly an integer as a signed 64-bit value, we reject the JSON document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do full UTF-8 validation as part of the parsing. (Parsers like fastjson, gason and dropbox json11 do not do UTF-8 validation.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fully validate the numbers. (Parsers like gason and ultranjson will accept &lt;code&gt;[0e+]&lt;/code&gt; as valid JSON.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We validate string content for unescaped characters. (Parsers like fastjson and ultrajson accept unescaped line breaks and tabs in strings.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parser works in three stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 1. (Find marks) Identifies quickly structure elements, strings, and so forth. We validate UTF-8 encoding at that stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 2. (Structure building) Involves constructing a &quot;tree&quot; of sort (materialized as a tape) to navigate through the data. Strings and numbers are parsed at this stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Navigating the parsed document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a code sample to dump back the parsed JSON to a string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    ParsedJson::iterator &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pjh&lt;/span&gt;(pj);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!pjh.isOk()) {
      std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Could not iterate parsed result. &lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;compute_dump&lt;/span&gt;(pj);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; where compute_dump is :&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;compute_dump&lt;/span&gt;(ParsedJson::iterator &amp;amp;pjh) {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (pjh.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;is_object&lt;/span&gt;()) {

&lt;h2&gt;In-depth comparisons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see how a wide range of parsers validate a given JSON file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make allparserscheckfile
./allparserscheckfile myfile.json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For performance comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make parsingcompetition
./parsingcompetition myfile.json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For broader comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make allparsingcompetition
./allparsingcompetition myfile.json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validating UTF-8 takes no more than 0.7 cycles per byte:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remarks on JSON parsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The JSON spec defines what a JSON parser is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation. A JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar. A JSON parser MAY accept non-JSON forms or extensions. An implementation may set limits on the size of texts that it accepts. An implementation may set limits on the maximum depth of nesting. An implementation may set limits on the range and precision of numbers. An implementation may set limits on the length and character contents of strings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSON is not JavaScript:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All JSON is Javascript but NOT all Javascript is JSON. So {property:1} is invalid because property does not have double quotes around it. {'property':1} is also invalid, because it's single quoted while the only thing that can placate the JSON specification is double quoting. JSON is even fussy enough that {&quot;property&quot;:.1} is invalid too, because you should have of course written {&quot;property&quot;:0.1}. Also, don't even think about having comments or semicolons, you guessed it: they're invalid.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural characters are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;begin-array     =  [ left square bracket
begin-object    =  { left curly bracket
end-array       =  ] right square bracket
end-object      =  } right curly bracket
name-separator  = : colon
value-separator = , comma
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pseudo-structural elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A character is pseudo-structural if and only if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not enclosed in quotes, AND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a non-whitespace character, AND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's preceding chararacter is either: (a) a structural character, OR (b) whitespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps as we redefine some new characters as pseudo-structural such as the characters 1, 1, G, n in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{ &quot;foo&quot; : 1.5, &quot;bar&quot; : 1.5 GEOFF_IS_A_DUMMY bla bla , &quot;baz&quot;, null }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, a simple link aggregator owned and operated by Silicon Valley startup incubator &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt;, has had many &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16409768&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on SV startups and engineers as a whole. On Hacker News, users receive Karma whenever another user upvotes a submission or comment they made, which incentives positive contributions to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in maintaining its simplicity, many new features and behaviors added over the years on Hacker News are not fully documented other than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12073675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;occasional&lt;/a&gt; comments from staff. This list details some of the hidden norms about Hacker News not otherwise covered in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, along with a few bonus features outside of typical HN usage. If there is anything missing/incorrect from this list, feel free to file a GitHub issue/PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This list has no affiliation with Hacker News, Y Combinator, or any YC-backed company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Undocumented Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moderators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News currently has two full time moderators: Dan Gackle (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dang&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dang&lt;/a&gt;) and Scott Bell (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sctb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sctb&lt;/a&gt;). Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=dang&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=sctb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;replies&lt;/a&gt; provide a pseudo-log of Hacker News moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are very responsive when contacted at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hn@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;hn@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt;, and is the best option for resolving any issues on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downvoting Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All comments start with a score of 1 point (but in order to prevent bandwagoning, the comment score is not visible to users other than the author). After users reach &lt;strong&gt;501 Karma&lt;/strong&gt;, they gain the ability to downvote another comment. Downvoted comments (i.e. with a score &amp;lt; 1) reduce their placement on the comment thread and will appear desaturated to other users deemphasize them. There is no upper limit on the score of a comment, but the minimum score is -4 points. You cannot downvote comments which are direct replies to your own comment, and you cannot downvote &lt;strong&gt;24 hours&lt;/strong&gt; after the original comment was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented/blob/master/images/hn_downvotes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented/raw/master/images/hn_downvotes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaining about being downvoted is discouraged and usually results in even more downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the comment desaturation makes Hacker News difficult to read, you can click on the comment's timestamp to go to its page where the comment will no longer be faded, or you can install the CSS extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16426569&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;discussed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flagging/Vouching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user has &lt;strong&gt;31 Karma&lt;/strong&gt;, they can flag submissions. Although submissions cannot be downvoted, flags act as a &quot;super&quot; downvote and enough flags will strongly reduce the rank of the submission, or kill it entirely (flagging is supposed to be used for submissions which break the site guidelines, but that isn't always the case in practice). A submission that's flagged to death will have a &lt;code&gt;[flagged]&lt;/code&gt; tag. Comments behave similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt; submission (that does not also show &lt;code&gt;[flagged]&lt;/code&gt;) is killed by a moderator or by the software. They will only be shown to users who have &lt;code&gt;showdead&lt;/code&gt; enabled in their profile. A submission can simultaneously be &lt;code&gt;[flagged]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user has &lt;strong&gt;31 Karma&lt;/strong&gt;, they can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/two-hn-announcements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vouch&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt; submission/comment. A vouched submission/comment has its rank restored (and potentially improved as the vouch can counteract the effects of flags), but it can be &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt; again at which point it can't be re-vouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting Top Color&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user has &lt;strong&gt;251 Karma&lt;/strong&gt;, they can set the color of the top bar in their profile settings. The default is #ff6600. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/topcolors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;complete set&lt;/a&gt; of colors users have set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Voting Manipulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAQ states &quot;users should vote for a story because they personally find it intellectually interesting, not because someone has content to promote.&quot; Indeed, Hacker News &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7972941&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;utilizes&lt;/a&gt; a voting ring detector which will prevent caught submissions from hitting the front page. Due to sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; normalizing the asking for upvotes or other engagement via social media, the implicit asking of upvotes is also done for Hacker News, usually due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/958397508996055040&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ignorance&lt;/a&gt; of the Hacker News rule against it. There are very few good reasons to draw attention to a Hacker News submission immediately after it has been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One popular &quot;trick&quot; for obfuscating voting manipulation on Hacker News is to link to the Hacker News's &lt;code&gt;/newest&lt;/code&gt; page of new submissions (instead of a direct link which would otherwise make voting manipulation obvious), and asking friends to upvote the submission from that page. This trick doesn't actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flame-War Detector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAQ notes that submission rank is impacted by &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16020089&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;software which downweights overheated discussions&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; A good rule of thumb for this effect is when the number of comments on a submission exceeds its score. Moderators can overrule the downranking for appropriate, not-actually-a-flame-war discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second-Chance Pool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators will sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11662380&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rescue a post&lt;/a&gt; which didn't receive a lot of upvotes and reset the submission time on the post. (This is also one of the reasons why the FAQ discourages deleting submissions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, moderators can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10308900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;invite users&lt;/a&gt; via email to resubmit a post which didn't get much traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Edit/Delete Time Limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a post or comment is made, it can be edited by the author &lt;strong&gt;within 2 hours&lt;/strong&gt;. A post/comment can be deleted by the author within those two hours, &lt;strong&gt;but only if it has no replies&lt;/strong&gt;, in order to prevent discussion from being lost. In that case, the post/comment &lt;strong&gt;cannot be deleted&lt;/strong&gt; (This can result in a fake &lt;code&gt;[deleted]&lt;/code&gt; edit if a person wants to remove their comment in the limit but can't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need something deleted but you can't, you'll have to message &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hn@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;hn@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comment Collapsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments can be collapsed by clicking the &lt;code&gt;[+]&lt;/code&gt; icon to improve readability.&lt;code&gt;[flagged]&lt;/code&gt; comments are sometimes collapsed by default, and moderators can set a comment to automatically be collapsed if necessary (e.g. meta-discussion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a comment thread is collapsed, the &lt;code&gt;[+x]&lt;/code&gt; number on the right indicates the total number of hidden children comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shadowbanning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both users and domains can be shadowbanned, where all posts/comments by that user / submissions to that domain will be instantly &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt; and cannot receive votes/comments (but can still be vouched). For accounts with a substantial history on Hacker News, moderators &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16441707&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;will give warnings&lt;/a&gt; before a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to tell if a user/domain is banned is to either have another user with &lt;code&gt;showdead&lt;/code&gt; enabled check for a series of &lt;code&gt;[dead]&lt;/code&gt; content from that source, or view those submissions in Private Browsing/Incognito mode to see if they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented/blob/master/images/shadowban.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented/raw/master/images/shadowban.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users/domains are usually shadowbanned for breaking HN rules/spam. If you feel you are unfairly shadowbanned, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hn@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;hn@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Green Usernames&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts which are less than &lt;strong&gt;2 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; old will appear with a green username.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behaviors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implicit Downranking of Politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guidelines state that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; political discussion is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; off-topic. However, the line between technology and politics is blurred, especially as of recently. Most tech related submissions with a hint of political partisanship will quickly be flagged to death by users (or die a slow death due to the inevitable flame war).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implicit Downranking of Topics Around Diversity and Inclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, topics around diversity and inclusion in tech have gained lots of visibility over the past few years. However, despite these discussions not being off-topic, they tend to be flagged to death by users regardless. Unfortunately. (Moderators occasionally unkill such threads if they see it in time, although it rarely sticks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paywalls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many news websites have started implementing a paywall for their content, which has caused conflict with Hacker News's &quot;original source&quot; rule. The &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; button next to submissions (that does a DuckDuckGo search for the given title) was partially intended to serve as a paywall workaround; however, recent changes to the paywall implementations have closed that loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, submissions which link to paywalled sites tend to get many comments complaining about paywalls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10178989&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;which are off-topic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perceived Favoritism Toward YC Companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YC Companies get two notable benefits on Hacker News; they can post jobs ads to the front page (which start off at Rank #6, cannot be voted/commented on, and have a fixed decay rate), and the ability to do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/?query=Launch%20HN&amp;amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;dateRange=all&amp;amp;type=story&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Launch HN&lt;/a&gt; when their startup launches out of a YC batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no evidence that non-job submissions about a YC startup receive preferential treatment on the front page, or kill submissions critical of a YC startup. In fact, the moderators have stated that they explicitly &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8258752&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;avoid killing controversial YC posts&lt;/a&gt; when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, founders of YC companies see each other's usernames &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;show up in orange,&lt;/a&gt; which — although not an explicit benefit — does allow fellow YC founders to immediately identify one another in discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downranking of Tutorials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HN submissions which are tutorials are &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16485753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;downranked by moderators&lt;/a&gt;, as they gratify intellectual curiosity less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News Classic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News allows people to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/classic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;old front page ranking algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, which only &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16442776&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;counts votes&lt;/a&gt; from early users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News Wayback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News allows users to see what the front page looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2012-03-24&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at any point in time&lt;/a&gt;. You can also do a wayback view for any user at their registration date by clicking their registration date in their profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News on BigQuery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to gather large amount of Hacker News data for data analysis/machine learning, you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/hacker-news&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hacker News dataset on BigQuery&lt;/a&gt;, which is updated daily and is much more pragmatic to use than manually scraping data from the Hacker News API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/lists&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;list of useful links&lt;/a&gt; that allow for primitive filtering by certain types of content. These currently include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/leaders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/leaders&lt;/a&gt; — View a list of users with the most karma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/front&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/front&lt;/a&gt; — Filter front page submissions for a given day (e.g. 2016-06-20), ordered by time spent there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/best&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/best&lt;/a&gt; — View the highest-voted recent links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/active&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/active&lt;/a&gt; — View the links with the most active current discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/bestcomments&lt;/a&gt; — List the highest-voted recent comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/noobstories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/noobstories&lt;/a&gt; — Show submissions from new accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/noobcomments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/noobcomments&lt;/a&gt; — List comments from new accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list on HN is currently missing these additional links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacker News Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HN Search&lt;/a&gt; provides real-time full-text search for Hacker News. The web app is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/algolia/hn-search&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and powered by Algolia Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filter Out Posts Below X Points&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>I Hit $115k/Month with a Status Quo Improvement</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-i-hit-115k-mo-with-a-status-quo-improvement-c45d11ad17</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Ajay Goel, a software developer by trade, and I'm building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co&quot;&gt;GMass&lt;/a&gt;, an email marketing plugin for Gmail. GMass is used by entrepreneurs and salespeople to send email campaigns from inside their Gmail accounts. The email campaigns can range from promotional campaigns to existing customers, cold email campaigns to prospects, or announcements to a list of subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMass is generating around $130K/month in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;home&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/gmass__home.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What motivated you to get started with GMass?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMass wasn’t my first foray into the email marketing space, I actually built and sold another email marketing platform called JangoMail in 2013. Afterward, I knew I wanted to build something else but wasn’t sure what that something would be, so I swam around for a while in limbo. Then in 2014, Google debuted their API for Gmail. This got me excited—out of any platform, I spend the most time in my Gmail account. At the time, I was working on a project for which I wanted to be able to send low-volume email campaigns (to 10 or 20 people) from my Gmail account. There were already tons of well-known plugins for Gmail like Boomerang, Yesware, and Grammarly, so I assumed that somebody had developed a good tool for email campaigns as well. I was genuinely surprised when I couldn’t find anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just sold JangoMail, I was hesitant to jump right back into the email marketing space. I was sure I would be doing something different next, but when I couldn’t find what I needed in the market, I knew I had to build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What went into building the initial product?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built the first version of GMass with the help of a freelancer in about two weeks. I wrote the specifications for the front-end and the back-end. I developed the front-end as a Chrome extension, and the freelancer wrote the back-end in C# using SQL Server as the database. A well-known company in Silicon Valley called Streak had just released a front-end library for Gmail called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inboxsdk.com/&quot;&gt;Inbox SDK&lt;/a&gt;, so I built the GMass Chrome extension based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My JavaScript skills weren't particularly strong at the time, and anybody that builds a plugin for Gmail must know JavaScript inside and out as they are essentially hacking the Gmail UI, so the availability of Inbox SDK gave me JavaScript superpowers that I otherwise wouldn't have had. I was so excited to have a working version to play with that I paid the freelancer $5,000 dollars to build the backend that I needed under the condition that he delivered his part within seven days, which he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this happened while I was living out of a hotel room in Oahu, Hawaii. My then-girlfriend was getting her yoga certification there, and the program lasted a month. By the time we left Hawaii, I had a working prototype of GMass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember35924&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most successful businesses aren't based on revolutionary ideas, but rather improvements to the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__actions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of the product only did one thing: You paste a bunch of names and/or email addresses into the “To” field of the Gmail Compose window like you normally would, and then hit a button to send out individual, personalized emails to each recipient. So, if you put 10 addresses in, you would now see 10 emails in your Sent Mail folder. The sending took place in real-time, so the first sign of trouble came when someone wanted to send to 1,000 addresses. Because I had everything running in a simple loop, the Gmail interface would hang for minutes upon minutes while the emails sent. This was obviously a poor user experience, so modifying the architecture to handle sending asynchronously was one of the first big changes I made after the initial launch. Once that was done, I fleshed the product out by enabling users to schedule campaigns for the future, and, later, to track opens and clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How have you attracted users and grown GMass?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first announced GMass on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/&quot;&gt;startups subreddit&lt;/a&gt; at the end of August 2015. At that time, you were allowed to name and give a link to what you were working on, but the rules have since changed. My reddit thread was the #1 thread on r/startups for about 24 hours, which drove some of the initial signups. Next, I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/gmass-2&quot;&gt;GMass on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in September 2015, which was a huge success. It drove a ton of traffic and user signups exploded, with a new account being created every three minutes. That felt really good. Then, as happens to many startups with a big launch, the traffic died down. Once the dust settled, we had about one new user an hour, most of whom didn't even send a test email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our listing on the Chrome Web Store also drove some signups. One of the search phrases that turns up GMass is &quot;mail merge&quot;, and I wanted GMass to show up if you ran that search in the Chrome Web Store. At the time, the results only showed the top three relevant hits, and GMass was #4. But I noticed that one of the top three products was a defunct product that wasn't being supported anymore. I contacted the developer of that tool and gently asked if he would be so kind as to remove his product entirely, and explained why. Surprisingly, he said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMass makes money by charging a monthly subscription price for use. Plans range from about $7/month to $20/month. I started charging about a year after launch—prior to that, it was free for everyone. The main reason I started charging was to cut down on spammers using the system. As a free, unmonitored email marketing solution, GMass attracted the underbelly of the web. Before making the switch to payment plans, an FBI agent relayed to me that, &quot;GMass has become the tool of choice for scammers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent out a few email campaigns to my user base announcing the upcoming monetization, letting them know that after I flipped the switch, they would have to pay to send larger campaigns. Most of the feedback I got was negative. A lot of &quot;f*** you&quot; and whatnot, saying I had misled them or led them on. It didn't bother me, because I've always heard that people are much likelier to voice their opinion when they're mad than happy. I'm the same way when I write Yelp reviews. When I finally did flip the switch at midnight one day, I sat in front of my email, reloading and reloading, waiting for the first notification to arrive of a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hour went by...nothing. Two hours went by...nothing. I could even see that users were getting the &quot;Hey, sorry you can't send this campaign until you subscribe. Here's a link to subscribe&quot; message, and clicking the link, but then not putting in their credit card. Was something wrong? I put my own credit card in to test. It worked. Another hour went by, and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was still the only subscriber. A wave of panic hit me at that point. Maybe people didn't think GMass was worth paying for. Maybe I priced it too high. Maybe I’d made a huge mistake. Tired of thinking about it, I went to bed and hoped for something better come morning time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did when I opened my eyes was reached for my phone and checked my email. Thankfully, in the eight hours that had passed while I was snoozing, a handful of people had subscribed. In retrospect, I flipped the switch at midnight, when the most active users are overseas in India and China. So it made sense that it didn't trigger a wave of new subscribers right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Stripe as our payments provider, not for any profound reason other than I liked their API docs better than Braintree's, and Braintree was part of PayPal, and I found PayPal's entire ecosystem archaic. I ended up adding PayPal as an option later, though, after users from countries where credit cards aren't as prevalent asked for it. Running a SaaS company using PayPal's subscription payments platform is a pain. Their docs are terribly outdated and often incorrect. We continue to support our PayPal integration only because PayPal is so popular worldwide, but I wish it would die a quick death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMass is a pure software business. We don't do any paid ads right now, so my biggest expense is our Amazon AWS bill, which is around $8,000/month. The next biggest expenses are marketing and SEO related. I have one freelance marketer and two SEO firms working on GMass's behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pricing&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/gmass__pricing.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are your goals for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main goal for GMass is to grow it to the point where it's fondly remembered beyond my lifetime. When I sold my first company, I became financially secure, so with this venture, I'm more focused on my legacy and less focused on making a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of metrics, my short-term goal for GMass is to have 10,000 active paying users. I'm pretty close to that right now. I'd also like my email list to be at 1M addresses. I'd feel pretty powerful knowing I can communicate any message I want to a million people with just a few clicks. Right now it's about 250,000. I'm hoping that by the end of 2019, GMass will be at a $3 million annual run rate. My strategy for accomplishing all this is to build more tools for our website in order to attract more traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t fall into the trap of focusing on the hottest trends. Build a solid product with a few happy users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__actions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been doing that slowly, but I'm going to get more aggressive in 2019. For example, we built this tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co/inbox&quot;&gt;Inbox, Spam, or Promotions?&lt;/a&gt; so that any email marketer, even if they're not using GMass, can see where their emails are landing. A couple weeks ago I launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co/domains&quot;&gt;Domain Statistics Database&lt;/a&gt; so people can research a domain, see our delivery rates to that domain, and see what kinds of bounce codes that domain generates. I'm planning on adding a lot more data to this, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS&quot;&gt;WHOIS data&lt;/a&gt;, and contact data for the organization's leadership, because I want this to become the standard source of information about domains, such that when you Google any domain, our page on that domain comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that GMass has been lacking in has been integrations with CRM systems like Salesforce and Hubspot, so I'll be working on that next year also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest challenges you've faced and obstacles you've overcome? If you had to start over, what would you do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ongoing challenges of the software design approach we took is that we are hacking up the Gmail interface, and this isn't a method of programming sanctioned by Google. Google regularly updates Gmail's code, which results in GMass breaking, and it's a constant battle to keep up with the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software developer whose skills are now mostly back-end based, I've never put much emphasis on design and user experience. Even today I get feedback from users saying &quot;It looks like this was designed by a software developer for other software developers.&quot; They’re not wrong! If I could go back, I would have brought in a UX designer early on to help me get the flow right from campaign creation to sending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six months after launch, my lead developer emailed me to tell me he was quitting. This was a big deal because I hadn't kept my software development skills up to date. I knew classic ASP and VB6. I did not know how to program in .NET and C#, and that's what GMass had been built on. A wiser CEO would have hired a new developer to pick up where the old one left off, but the control freak in me decided that the best course of action was to learn the codebase and learn C# so that I could make my own changes and hopefully never be put in that precarious position again. I'm still the lead developer, though I probably shouldn't be. There are a lot of other things I should be focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building GMass as a Chrome extension that worked &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the Gmail interface, rather than &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the Gmail interface was a critical decision that I believe has paid off. Because my competitors, of which there are now many, have built external interfaces that let you create and send campaigns. Our biggest differentiator and something that I think would be hard for anyone else to copy is that we work &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The luck of timing was also critical for GMass’s success. Even though I launched at a time when hundreds of email marketing services already existed, there were almost no tools in existence that did it inside of Gmail. The arrival of the Gmail API from Google and the Inbox SDK from Streak were critical to the creation of GMass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I sleep with a CPAP machine, and I've found that it's enabled me to get by with only five to six hours of sleep, allowing me to be productive during most of my waking hours. Before my CPAP, I was sleeping 9-10 hours a day just to feel normal. It's weird, but my CPAP machine has been the biggest contributor to my productivity gains in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gmass.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;features&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/gmass__features.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your advice for indie hackers who are just starting out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most successful businesses aren't based on revolutionary ideas, but rather improvements to the status quo. The media tends to focus on the revolutionary ideas, so it's easy to think that an idea isn't worth pursuing if it's not groundbreaking. But in my case, email marketing had been around forever when I started GMass but I found an unfulfilled niche and built a business out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that my entrepreneur friends often fall into the trap of focusing on the hottest trends rather than building a solid product with a few happy users. It's so easy to get caught up in figuring out how to launch an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or setting up meetings with investors before you even have a solid product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know one entrepreneur building an app who's too focused on the security of his app. Unless the fundamental offering of your app is security, you don't need to be concerned about that until you have some actual users to secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to get something built that at least a handful of people are getting value out of before worrying about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don't spend too much time designing the perfect logo that represents all of your core values and your mission in life. Nobody cares about your logo in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. Supreme Court Puts Limits on Police Power to Seize Private Property</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/civil-asset-forfeiture-supreme-court.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/civil-asset-forfeiture-supreme-court.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the Constitution places limits on the ability of states and localities to take and keep cash, cars, houses and other private property used to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The practice, known as civil forfeiture, is a popular way to raise revenue and is easily abused, and it has been the subject of widespread criticism across the political spectrum. The court’s decision will open the door to new legal arguments when the value of the property seized was out of proportion to the crimes involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In this case, the court sided with Tyson Timbs, a small-time drug offender in Indiana who pleaded guilty to selling $225 of heroin to undercover police officers. He was sentenced to one year of house arrest and five years of probation, and was ordered to pay $1,200 in fees and fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;State officials also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/supreme-court-civil-asset-forfeiture.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;seized Mr. Timbs’s $42,000 Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;, which he had bought with the proceeds of his father’s life insurance policy, saying he had used it to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Supreme Court &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-6073.ZS.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the Eighth Amendment, which bars “excessive fines,” limits the ability of the federal government to seize property. On Wednesday, in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1091_5536.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9-to-0 decision&lt;/a&gt; that united justices on the left and right, the court ruled that the clause also applies to the states under the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#amdt_14_(1868)&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, one of the post-Civil War amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for eight justices, said the question before the court was an easy one. “The historical and logical case for concluding that the 14th Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is overwhelming,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties,” she wrote. “Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Quoting from &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-7272.ZS.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an earlier decision&lt;/a&gt;, she wrote that even absent a political motive, “fines may be employed ‘in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence,’ for ‘fines are a source of revenue,’ while other forms of punishment ‘cost a state money.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Ginsburg also wrote that excessive fines have played a dark role in this nation’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Following the Civil War,” she wrote, “Southern states enacted Black Codes to subjugate newly freed slaves and maintain the prewar racial hierarchy. Among these laws’ provisions were draconian fines for violating broad proscriptions on ‘vagrancy’ and other dubious offenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The decision will not halt civil forfeitures, said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ij.org/staff/whottot/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wesley P. Hottot&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer with the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ij.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Institute for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, which represented the Land Rover’s owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“People are still going to lose their property without being convicted of a crime, they’re still going to have their property seized,” Mr. Hottot said. “The new thing is that they can now say at the end of it all, whether I’m guilty or not, I can argue that it was excessive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Law enforcement agencies have resisted efforts to curtail civil forfeiture, saying they rely on the proceeds for sorely needed equipment. It is difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the total value of civil forfeitures by local police departments and prosecutors, but a significant portion comes from joint operations with federal law enforcement and is tracked by the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In fiscal year 2018, state and local agencies received &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/afp/page/file/1126576/download&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$400 million&lt;/a&gt; through this arrangement, known as equitable sharing. The amount &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/afp/fy2018-equitable-sharing-payment-cash-and-sales-proceeds-recipient-agency-state&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;varied widely by agency&lt;/a&gt; — the Surprise Police Department in Arizona received $570,000, while the Buffalo Police Department in upstate New York got $130,000. The New York Police Department took in $7.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Philadelphia, forfeiture proceeds once accounted for 20 percent of prosecutors’ budget, while agencies in New York and California tended to take in the highest sums, according to the Institute for Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investigations across the country have uncovered many examples where the property seized was disproportionate to the crime, taken from innocent citizens or targeted in accordance with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;law enforcement wish lists&lt;/a&gt;. As its name suggests, a civil forfeiture does not require a criminal conviction or even criminal charges but only proof that the property at issue was used in connection with a crime. Owners who wish to reclaim their property must demonstrate that it was not, or that it was used without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A recent series of articles by the Greenville News examined every civil forfeiture case in South Carolina from 2014 to 2016, finding examples like that of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.greenvilleonline.com/in-depth/news/taken/2019/01/27/taken-ella-bromell-conway-sc-civil-forfeiture-investigative-journalism/2459430002/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ella Bromell&lt;/a&gt;, a 72-year-old woman who had to fight off the forfeiture of her home after drug dealers conducted transactions on her property, despite Ms. Bromell’s multiple attempts to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a similar case in Philadelphia, where law enforcement agencies once took in $5.6 million a year in civil forfeiture, according to the Institute for Justice, a couple’s home was seized in 2014 after their son was arrested on charges of making a $40 drug sale there. A case against the city’s forfeiture practices was finally settled last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Ginsburg suggested that the effect of the ruling could be limited. “All 50 states,” she wrote, “have a constitutional provision prohibiting the imposition of excessive fines either directly or by requiring proportionality.” Wednesday’s decision may influence how state courts interpret those provisions, and they may use them to scrutinize civil forfeitures more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Supreme Court had already ruled that most of the protections in the Bill of Rights, which originally restricted the power of only the federal government, also applied to the states under the 14th Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The court left open the question of whether the seizure of Mr. Timbs’s Land Rover amounted to an excessive fine, leaving its resolution to lower courts. But Justice Ginsburg suggested that the penalty was disproportionate to the offense, writing that the vehicle was worth “more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for his drug conviction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with the result in the case, Timbs v. Indiana, No. 17-1091, but said he would have gotten to the same place by a different route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the majority on Wednesday relied on the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, Justice Thomas said he would have ruled “the right to be free from excessive fines is one of the ‘privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States’ protected by the 14th Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The difference between the two approaches was meaningful, he wrote, accusing the Supreme Court of misplaced reliance on the due process clause to establish substantive constitutional rights like ones to abortion and same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Thomas did not address objections to modern civil forfeiture practices on Wednesday. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-122_1b7d.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In a 2017 opinion&lt;/a&gt;, though, he wrote that “this system — where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use — has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses.” His opinion cited reporting from &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/?utm_term=.3476f50ca105&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/taken&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Hottot, who argued on behalf of Mr. Timbs, said courts alone cannot address the abuses inherent in civil forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Police and prosecutors will continue to engage in this kind of policing for profit unless and until legislatures no longer allow them to keep 100 percent of the proceeds to forfeitures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He added that Wednesday’s ruling could nonetheless bring needed scrutiny to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Police and prosecutors have no incentive to be reasonable about what they take because they get to keep everything they take,” he said. “Now we know that judges at the end of the process have to evaluate if that’s really justice or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Pee, Not Chlorine, Causes Red Eyes from Swimming Pools: CDC (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/pee-chlorine-red-eyes-swimming-pools-cdc-1.3127865</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/pee-chlorine-red-eyes-swimming-pools-cdc-1.3127865</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chlorine has long had a bad rap for irritating the eyes of swimmers, especially in crowded public pools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As it turns out, however, it's not the chemical itself turning your eyes red after a swim — it's everything else in the water that chlorine goes in to kill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, human urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently teamed up with both the Water Quality and Health Council and the National Swimming Pool Foundation to warn the public about health risks associated with summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Smell that 'chlorine'?&quot; reads &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/pdf/swimming/resources/share-fun-not-germs-508c.pdf&quot;&gt;a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; released by the coalition last month. &quot;It's not what you think. What you smell are actually chemicals that form when chlorine mixes with pee, poop, sweat, and dirt from swimmers' bodies.… These chemicals — not chlorine — can cause your eyes to get red and sting, make your nose run, and make you cough.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3128509.1435283433!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/cdc-peeing-in-the-pool-fact-sheet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Swimming with someone who has diarrhea is more than just gross. According to the CDC, it can be dangerous. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://nspf.org/en/NewsNew/15-05-19/Healthy_Pools_Red_Eye.aspx&quot;&gt;companion report&lt;/a&gt; published by the National Swimming Pool Foundation, an American non-profit dedicated to aquatic health and safety, elaborates on what it is about urine that leads to red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chlorine and other disinfectants are added to a swimming pool to destroy germs,&quot; said Michele Hlavsa, chief of CDC's Healthy Swimming Program, in a release. &quot;Peeing in a pool depletes chlorine and actually produces an irritant that makes people's eyes turn red.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate the irritants caused by nitrogen-containing compounds found in urine, more chlorine may need to be added to a pool, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red eyes are one of several colour-related topics tackled by the nationwide campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another relates to what the swimming pool foundation calls &quot;the most common pool myth of all time&quot; — one that nearly half of all Americans surveyed by researchers believed was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Parents have long used the story of a chemical that changes colour in the presence of pee to keep their children from peeing in the pool,&quot; reads the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundation CEO Thomas M. Lachocki made the truth clear, saying &quot;there isn't a dye that turns red. It's the eyes that turn red. Swimmers' eyes are the real colour indicator that someone might have peed in a pool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.8218181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.8218181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who get into the water can carry in and spread germs. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwimHealthy?src=hash&quot;&amp;gt;#SwimHealthy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/wsCJw3zWB0&quot;&amp;gt;http://t.co/wsCJw3zWB0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/4A2liL48Zm&quot;&amp;gt;pic.twitter.com/4A2liL48Zm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/601024696486731776&quot;&gt;@CDCgov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As gross as that sounds, it's one of the mildest potential ailments that can be caused by human waste in a public pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swimming at an indoor pool is particularly risky, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/pools/irritants-indoor-pool-air-quality.html&quot;&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, as the irritants mentioned above can move into the air surrounding a pool and trigger coughing, wheezing, or even asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's the issue of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview about the campaign with Women's Health, the CDC Healthy Water program's associate director noted that there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pee-in-pool-water&quot;&gt;been an increase&lt;/a&gt; in outbreaks of recreational water illnesses over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3128542.1435283481!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/cryptosporidium-virus.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of waterborne disease, according to the U.S. Centers For Disease Control. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this? People who swim &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/rwi/&quot;&gt;while they have diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; and unleash even very tiny amounts of &lt;span&gt;germs like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; (or &quot;crypto&quot; for short), &lt;/span&gt;norovirus&lt;span&gt;, and E. &lt;/span&gt;coli&lt;span&gt;. into the water. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Diarrhea and swimming don't mix!&quot; reads &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/rwi/illnesses/diarrhea-swimming.html&quot;&gt;the CDC's website&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Swimmers who are sick with diarrhea — or who have been sick in the last two weeks — risk contaminating pool water with germs. Certain germs that cause diarrhea can live from minutes to days in pools, even if the pool is well-maintained. Once the pool has been contaminated, all it takes is for someone to swallow a small amount of pool water to become infected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 58 per cent of Canadians admitted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travelzoo/64-of-americans-pee-in-po_b_7598626.html&quot;&gt;to peeing in the pool&lt;/a&gt; at least once in a recent survey of 9,500 people conducted by Travelocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're one of them, Hlavsa has some advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The solution isn't rocket science; it's common courtesy. Swimmers should use the pool to swim, the restroom to pee and the showers to wash up before getting in the pool. It's that simple.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
