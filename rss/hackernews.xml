<title>Redis Turns 10 – How it started with a single post on Hacker News</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;row align-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;small-12 columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;10 years ago,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=494649&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a link was posted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on Hacker News to a new software project called Redis. In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=494649&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/news/127&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;antirez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) says “one of the major points of Redis is to support more complex types as values”. From Day 1, Salvatore knew what he wanted to build. And to his credit,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/one-year-of-redis.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;he stayed focused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Redis now has 10 complex types and a module system that enables developers to build more. And as a result, Redis is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/key-value+store&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the most popular key-value store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Salvatore could not have done this alone. Someone had to be the first to share the link, and someone had to be the first to try the software. That first post was shared by David Welton (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=davidw&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;davidw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I have no idea if he tried the software, or just thought it seemed cool, but he took a risk and shared it on Hacker News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only five people commented on that first post: three promoted alternative data stores; one suggested Salvatore re-write Redis in Erlang; and one, JUST ONE, offered some help. That one person turned out to be Ezra Zygmuntowicz (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ezmobius&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ezmobius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.newrelic.com/culture/ezra-zygmuntowicz/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), a very popular Ruby on Rails (RoR) developer and one of the founders of Engine Yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ezra not only encouraged Salvatore, but implemented the first Ruby client library for Redis. Then he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ezmobius/status/1252368007&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweeted about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which spread the word to the Rails community  At the time, RoR was helping developers create beautiful websites, but users of the framework struggled to make it scale. Thanks to Ezra’s efforts, Redis spread among RoR developers, and helped thousands of RoR websites scale. One of those websites was Twitter. Eventually, Redis went on to be a wildly popular add-on for Heroku developers, and then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/clients&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;many, many others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were others after David and Ezra. But, as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Derek Sivers says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “It takes guts to be a first follower. You stand out, you brave ridiculing yourself. Being a first follower is an underappreciated form of leadership”. Nine years ago,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/one-year-of-redis.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salvatore said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Your early adopters are not brave because they are irresponsible, just they can evaluate something without the need to follow the mass”. So thanks to Salvatore, David and Ezra, and other early risk takers, an open source community called Redis was born. And to those first adopters of the Redis community, as we turn 10 years old today, we say thank you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;First Follower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;by Derek Silvers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Want to meet the Redis community and see what all the fuss is about? Join us as we celebrate 10 years of Redis at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redislabs.com/redisconf19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RedisConf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the yearly gathering of Redis developers, implementers and other community members. This year it takes place April 2-3 on Pier 27 in San Francisco. Perhaps you’ll find something new that will inspire you to take a risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;One-Step Automated Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Install Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Piping to &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; is controversial&lt;/a&gt;, as it prevents you from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh&quot;&gt;reading code that is about to run&lt;/a&gt; on your system. Therefore, we provide these alternative installation methods which allow code review before installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 1: Clone our repository and run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
cd &quot;Pi-hole/automated install/&quot;
sudo bash basic-install.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 2: Manually download the installer and run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
sudo bash basic-install.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-install: Make your network take advantage of Pi-hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the installer has been run, you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-configure-my-devices-to-use-pi-hole-as-their-dns-server/245&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;configure your router to have &lt;strong&gt;DHCP clients use Pi-hole as their DNS server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which ensures that all devices connecting to your network will have content blocked without any further intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your router does not support setting the DNS server, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-use-pi-holes-built-in-dhcp-server-and-why-would-i-want-to/3026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;use Pi-hole's built-in DHCP server&lt;/a&gt;; just be sure to disable DHCP on your router first (if it has that feature available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, you can always manually set each device to use Pi-hole as their DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pi-hole is free, but powered by your support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reoccurring costs involved with maintaining free, open source, and privacy-respecting software; expenses which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people&quot;&gt;our volunteer developers&lt;/a&gt; pitch in to cover out-of-pocket. This is just one example of how strongly we feel about our software, as well as the importance of keeping it maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: &lt;strong&gt;your support is absolutely vital to help keep us innovating!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending a donation using our links below is &lt;strong&gt;extremely helpful&lt;/strong&gt; in offsetting a portion of our monthly expenses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd rather not &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/donate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which is okay!&lt;/em&gt;), there are other ways you can help support us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contributing via GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to contribute to issue reports, suggest new features, and create pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have something to add - anything from a typo through to a whole new feature, we're happy to check it out! Just make sure to fill out our template when submitting your request; the questions that it asks will help the volunteers quickly understand what you're aiming to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh&quot;&gt;install script&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/piholeDebug.sh&quot;&gt;debug script&lt;/a&gt; have an abundance of comments, which will help you better understand how Pi-hole works. They're also a valuable resource to those who want to learn how to write scripts or code a program! We encourage anyone who likes to tinker to read through it and submit a pull request for us to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presentations about Pi-hole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word-of-mouth continues to help our project grow immensely, and so we are helping make this easier for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be presenting Pi-hole at a conference, meetup or even a school project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/2017/05/17/giving-a-presentation-on-pi-hole-contact-us-first-for-some-goodies-and-support/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;get in touch with us&lt;/a&gt; so we can hook you up with free swag to hand out to your audience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting in touch with us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are primarily reachable on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discourse User Forum&lt;/a&gt;, we can also be found on a variety of social media outlets. &lt;strong&gt;Please be sure to check the FAQ's&lt;/strong&gt; before starting a new discussion, as we do not have the spare time to reply to every request for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Breakdown of Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Command Line Interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pihole&lt;/code&gt; command has all the functionality necessary to be able to fully administer the Pi-hole, without the need of the Web Interface. It's fast, user-friendly, and auditable by anyone with an understanding of &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/blacklist-cli.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/57f15d9665575a98275d3511f8f591863733b8c0/68747470733a2f2f70692d686f6c652e6769746875622e696f2f67726170686963732f53637265656e73686f74732f626c61636b6c6973742d636c692e676966&quot; alt=&quot;Pi-hole Blacklist Demo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/blacklist-cli.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Core-Function-Breakdown&quot;&gt;Core Feature Breakdown&lt;/a&gt;, as well as read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;example usage&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Web Interface Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE&quot;&gt;optional dashboard&lt;/a&gt; allows you to view stats, change settings, and configure your Pi-hole. It's the power of the Command Line Interface, with none of the learning curve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Long Term Statistics to view data over user-defined time ranges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to easily manage and configure Pi-hole features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... and all the main features of the Command Line Interface!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-access-pi-holes-dashboard-admin-interface/3168&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;access the dashboard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;IP_ADDPRESS_OF_YOUR_PI_HOLE&amp;gt;/admin/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://pi.hole/admin/&lt;/code&gt; (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://pi.hole/&lt;/code&gt; (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Faster-than-light Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTLDNS is a lightweight, purpose-built daemon used to provide statistics needed for the Web Interface, and its API can be easily integrated into your own projects. As the name implies, FTLDNS does this all &lt;em&gt;very quickly&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the statistics you can integrate include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total number of domains being blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of DNS queries today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of ads blocked today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of ads blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries forwarded (to your chosen upstream DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries cached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The API can be accessed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Web (&lt;code&gt;admin/api.php&lt;/code&gt;) and Command Line (&lt;code&gt;pihole -c -j&lt;/code&gt;). You can out find &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;more details over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Origin Of Pi-hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pi-hole being an &lt;strong&gt;advertising-aware DNS/Web server&lt;/strong&gt;, makes use of the following technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - a lightweight DNS and DHCP server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lighttpd.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lighttpd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - web server designed and optimized for high performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.php.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - a popular general-purpose web scripting language&lt;/li&gt;

<title>USB 3.2 is going to make the current USB branding even worse</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/07/usb-3-2-will-make-your-cables-twice-as-fast-once-youve-bought-new-devices/&quot;&gt;USB 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, which doubles the maximum speed of a USB connection to 20Gb/s, is likely to materialize in systems later this year. In preparation for this, the USB-IF—the industry group that together develops the various USB specifications—has announced the branding and naming that the new revision is going to use, and... it's awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB 3.0 was straightforward enough. A USB 3.0 connection ran at 5Gb/s, and slower connections were USB 2 or even USB 1.1. The new 5Gb/s data rate was branded &quot;SuperSpeed USB,&quot; following USB 2's 480Mb/s &quot;High Speed&quot; and USB 1.1's 12Mb/s &quot;Full Speed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then USB 3.1 came along and muddied the waters. Its big new feature was doubling the data rate to 10Gb/s. The logical thing would have been to identify existing 5Gb/s devices as &quot;USB 3.0&quot; and new 10Gb/s devices as &quot;USB 3.1.&quot; But that's not what the USB-IF did. For reasons that remain hard to understand, the decision was made to retroactively rebrand USB 3.0: 5Gb/s 3.0 connections became &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 1,&quot; with the 10Gb/s connections being &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 2.&quot; The consumer branding is &quot;SuperSpeed USB 10Gbps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this branding meant is that many manufacturers say that a device supports &quot;USB 3.1&quot; even if it's only a &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 1&quot; device running at 5Gb/s. Meanwhile, other manufacturers do the sensible thing: they use &quot;USB 3.0&quot; to denote 5Gb/s devices and reserve &quot;USB 3.1&quot; for 10Gb/s parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB 3.2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usb_3_2_language_product_and_packaging_guidelines_final.pdf&quot;&gt;doubles down on this confusion&lt;/a&gt;. 5Gb/s devices are now &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1.&quot; 10Gb/s devices become &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2.&quot; And 20Gb/s devices will be... &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2×2.&quot; Because they work by running two 10Gb/s connections along different pairs of wires simultaneously, and it's just obvious from arithmetic that you'd number the generations &quot;1, 2, 2×2.&quot; Perhaps they're named for powers of two, starting with zero? The consumer branding is a more reasonable &quot;SuperSpeed USB 20Gbps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part of all this is that USB 3.2 could mean 5, 10, or 20Gbps. You can bet that there will be manufacturers who are going to exploit that confusion wherever and whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California keeps a secret list of criminal cops, but says you can’t have it</title>
<link>https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/02/26/california-keeps-a-secret-list-of-criminal-cops-but-says-you-cant-have-it/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/02/26/california-keeps-a-secret-list-of-criminal-cops-but-says-you-cant-have-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Their crimes ranged from shoplifting to embezzlement to murder. Some of them molested kids and downloaded child pornography. Others beat their wives, girlfriends or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing they had in common: a badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of California law enforcement officers have been convicted of a crime in the past decade, according to records released by a public agency that sets standards for officers in the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations are alarming, but the state’s top cop says Californians don’t have a right to see them. In fact, Attorney General Xavier Becerra warned two Berkeley-based reporters that simply possessing this never-before-publicly-released list of convicted cops is a violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training — known as POST — provided the information last month in response to routine Public Records Act requests from reporters for the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley and its production arm, Investigative Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazyautosizes lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=310%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 310w&quot;/&gt;California Attorney General Xavier Becerra responds to questions from the Bay Area News Group’s Opinion and Editorial Board during an interview at the San Jose Mercury News office on Monday, April 16, 2018. Becerra is seeking re-election to the Attorney General’s office. (Michael Malone/Bay Area News Group) 
&lt;p&gt;But when Becerra’s office learned about the disclosure, it threatened the reporters with legal action unless they destroyed the records, insisting they are confidential under state law and were released inadvertently. The two journalism organizations have rejected Becerra’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s disheartening and ominous that the highest law enforcement officer in the state is threatening legal action over something the First Amendment makes clear can’t give rise to criminal action against a reporter,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a San Rafael-based nonprofit that advocates for free speech and open records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents provide a rare glimpse at the volume of officer misconduct at a time of heightened interest over police accountability. The list includes cops who trafficked drugs, cops who stole money from their departments and even one who robbed a bank wearing a fake beard. Some sexually assaulted suspects. Others took bribes, filed false reports and committed perjury. A large number drove under the influence of drugs and alcohol — sometimes killing people on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley journalists chose not to publish the entire list until they could spend more time reporting to avoid misidentifying people among the nearly 12,000 names in the documents, said John Temple, director of the Investigative Reporting Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the details are stunning in a state where officials have fought for years to keep virtually any record of police misconduct a secret. And they come amid a larger battle playing out in courtrooms throughout the state over California’s new police transparency law, Senate Bill 1421. Law enforcement groups have sued to limit the impact of that law, claiming it shouldn’t expose police disciplinary records created before the law took effect on Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becerra himself has rejected public records requests from his own agency, and he is now being sued by a prominent First Amendment group for failing to comply. Many other agencies in California have followed the attorney general’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you disclose a document that’s confidential and private, you can’t take it back,” Becerra told reporters earlier this month. ”You don’t get a second chance to get it right, you got to get it right the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that law has garnered the most attention and a public fight over police disciplinary records, it was another law that took effect Jan. 1 that led to the disclosure of the convictions of thousands of law enforcement officers and applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The secret list&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked into a public safety omnibus bill last year was a provision allowing the state’s Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to keep information in its records showing when a current or former law enforcement officer is convicted of a felony or other crime that would disqualify them from being a cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police departments often check POST’s records as part of the routine background check process when hiring new officers. But until the law changed, POST only labeled someone as being disqualified from serving in law enforcement when the person was convicted and had exhausted all appeals — which could take years and was difficult to track. The new law allows them to disqualify someone after a conviction, according to a POST spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the start of this year, Becerra’s office provided POST for the first time a list of what the agency says are convictions of current and former law enforcement officers and people who at one time had tried to become a cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST provided 10 years’ worth of convictions — nearly 12,000 names in all — to the Berkeley-based investigative reporting organizations in early January in response to a public records request. Three weeks later the AG’s office sent a letter saying the records were “inadvertently” released and were considered confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Becerra’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nic Marais, an attorney with Keker, Van Nest &amp;amp; Peters representing Investigative Studios, said the state’s assertions that the documents had been released “inadvertently” was hard to believe given that POST spent four weeks weighing the reporters’ request. In a letter to the AG, Marais wrote that because the documents appear to be a summary of public records, the disclosure exemptions cited by POST and Attorney General Becerra’s Office do not apply. Finally, he wrote that state law exempts reporters from prosecution for receiving records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder, of the First Amendment Coalition, argued the underlying records are in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Police officers are vested by the public with extraordinary power,” he said. “In order to monitor the use of that power, the public needs to know when they are over the line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But attorney Mike Rains, who represents police officers, questions why they should be singled out by such a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the extent the public wants that to be public record, I can understand that,” said Rains, who is leading a legal fight to block the release of officer disciplinary records under the new law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t we make that known for everybody?” Rains said of convictions, pointing out there’s no broad disclosure for lawyers, doctors, teachers and other trusted professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What the conviction list reveals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the indiscretions in the new documents released last month to the Berkeley investigative reporting organizations have never been revealed publicly until now. Some of the officers were fired from the force only after an arrest. Others remain on the job despite a criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3,500 names on the list appear to match the names of police officers in state personnel databases, and about 2,250 of those have been on the force within the last five years. But without more information, the exact breakdown of which individuals were in law enforcement as opposed to applicants to become an officer is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Caporale, a spokesman for POST, said his agency is using the list to check if active officers have committed crimes that should prevent them from working in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside readability=&quot;2.1428571428571&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get breaking news and alerts with our free mobile app. Get it from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareane.ws/mercappleapp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apple app store&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/googleplaymercapp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s that potential. That’s what we’re trying to eliminate … to make sure no one out there is a peace officer today who shouldn’t be,” Caporale said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also is on the lookout for former cops with convictions who try to get back into law enforcement, he said. “We want to make sure those folks don’t slip through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Jeong is on the list. He was an Emeryville police officer for a few months but failed his field training program. So he went to work as a dispatcher for the department. In August 2017, Jeong claimed to be a cop in order to buy a gun and three high capacity magazines in San Jose, according to court records. He was ultimately convicted of impersonating a police officer. Jeong declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Hayward police officer Joshua Cannon also is on the list. In October 2010, Cannon was arrested for driving drunk in Alameda County with blood alcohol nearly twice the legal limit. A CHP officer clocked him going 92 mph, and when the officer tried to pull him over, Cannon quickly pulled off the highway and down a sidestreet, court records show.
&lt;p&gt;Cannon eventually stopped and told the CHP officer that he was a cop and carrying an off-duty weapon. According to the CHP officer, Cannon “started asking me for a ‘break,’” the report said. “He also asked me that if I was in his situation what would I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon was convicted of misdemeanor driving under the influence — and remains on the force. He declined to comment for this story, citing department rules against talking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list also included a new revelation about a San Francisco police sergeant who had been the subject of numerous media reports for use-of-force complaints and shootings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Sgt. John Haggett was accused of helping a girlfriend dig up dirt on tenants. Internal Affairs started investigating after one of them claimed Haggett’s girlfriend made a disturbing threat: “My boyfriend is a police officer and will take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haggett, who is now retired, pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor for accessing the confidential information. He did not respond to an interview request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FTC Brings First Case Challenging Fake Paid Reviews on an Indie Retail Website</title>
<link>https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-brings-first-case-challenging-fake-paid-reviews-independent</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-brings-first-case-challenging-fake-paid-reviews-independent</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission today announced its first case challenging a marketer’s use of fake paid reviews on an independent retail website. In settling the agency’s complaint, Cure Encapsulations, Inc. and its owner, Naftula Jacobowitz, resolved allegations that they made false and unsubstantiated claims for their garcinia cambogia weight-loss supplement and that they paid a third-party website to write and post fake reviews on Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People rely on reviews when they’re shopping online,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “When a company buys fake reviews to inflate its Amazon ratings, it hurts both shoppers and companies that play by the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the FTC Did to Protect Consumers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_complaint_2-26-19.pdf&quot;&gt;FTC’s complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the defendants advertised and sold “Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia Extract with HCA” capsules on Amazon.com as an appetite-suppressing, fat-blocking, weight-loss pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC alleges that the defendants paid a website, amazonverifiedreviews.com, to create and post Amazon reviews of their product. The FTC contends that Jacobowitz told the website’s operator that his product needed to have an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars in order to have sales and to, “Please make my product … stay a five star.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the FTC’s complaint, the reviews the defendants bought were posted on Amazon.com and gave the product a five-star rating. The complaint charges the defendants with representing that the purchased Amazon reviews were truthful reviews written by actual purchasers, when in reality they were fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC’s complaint also alleges that the defendants made false and unsubstantiated claims on their Amazon product page, including through the purchased reviews, that their garcinia cambogia product is a “powerful appetite suppressant,” “Literally BLOCKS FAT From Forming,” causes significant weight loss, including as much as twenty pounds, and causes rapid and substantial weight loss, including as much as two or more pounds per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Settlement Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_proposed_order_2-26-19.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed court order settling the FTC’s complaint&lt;/a&gt; prohibits the defendants from making weight-loss, appetite-suppression, fat-blocking, or disease-treatment claims for any dietary supplement, food, or drug unless they have competent and reliable scientific evidence in the form of human clinical testing supporting the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order also requires the defendants to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to support any other claims about the health benefits or efficacy of such products. In addition, it prohibits them from making misrepresentations regarding endorsements, including that an endorsement is truthful or by an actual user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order next requires the defendants to email notices to consumers who bought Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia capsules detailing the FTC’s allegations regarding their efficacy claims. In addition, the order requires the defendants to notify Amazon, Inc. that they purchased Amazon reviews of their Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia capsules and to identify to Amazon the purchased reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the order imposes a judgment of $12.8 million, which will be suspended upon payment of $50,000 to the Commission and the payment of certain unpaid income tax obligations. If the defendants are later found to have misrepresented their financial condition to the FTC, the full amount of the judgment will immediately become due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and proposed stipulated final order was 5-0. The FTC filed the complaint and proposed order in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated final injunctions/orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection&quot;&gt;protect and educate consumers&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/&quot;&gt;learn more about consumer topics&lt;/a&gt; and file a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/complaint&quot;&gt;consumer complaint online&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357).

<title>The most popular docker images each contain at least 30 vulnerabilities</title>
<link>https://snyk.io/blog/top-ten-most-popular-docker-images-each-contain-at-least-30-vulnerabilities/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://snyk.io/blog/top-ten-most-popular-docker-images-each-contain-at-least-30-vulnerabilities/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Snyk’s annual State of Open Source Security report 2019.&lt;br/&gt;This report is split into several posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or download our lovely handcrafted pdf report which contains all of this information and more in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn-small&quot; href=&quot;https://bit.ly/SoOSS2019&quot;&gt;DOWNLOAD THE STATE OF OPEN SOURCE SECURITY REPORT 2019!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of application container technology is increasing at a remarkable rate and is expected to grow by a further 40% in 2020, according to 451 Research. It is common for system libraries to be available in many docker images, as these rely on a parent image that is commonly using a Linux distribution as a base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker images almost always bring known vulnerabilities alongside their great value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve scanned through ten of the most popular images with Snyk’s recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/container-vulnerability-management-for-developers/&quot;&gt;docker scanning capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that in every docker image we scanned, we found vulnerable versions of system libraries. The official Node.js image ships 580 vulnerable system libraries, followed by the others each of which ship at least 30 publicly known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8032&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121069/Number_of_OS_vulnerabilities_by_docker_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number of OS vulnerabilities by docker image&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;563&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyk recently released its container vulnerability management solution to empower developers to fully own the security of their dockerized applications. Using this new capability, developers can find known vulnerabilities in their docker base images and fix them using Snyk’s remediation advice. Snyk suggests either a minimal upgrade, or alternative base images that contain fewer or even no vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix can be easy if you’re aware. 20% of images can fix vulnerabilities simply by rebuilding a docker image, 44% by swapping base image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on scans performed by Snyk users, we found that 44% of docker image scans had known vulnerabilities, and for which there were newer and more secure base image available. This remediation advise is unique to Snyk. Developers can take action to upgrade their docker images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyk also reported that 20% of docker image scans had known vulnerabilities that simply required a rebuild of the image to reduce the number of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Long Term Support (LTS) version of the Node.js runtime is version 10. The image tagged with 10 (i.e: node:10) is essentially an alias to node:10.14.2- jessie (at the time that we tested it) where jessie specifies an obsolete version of Debian that is no longer actively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had chosen that image as a base image in your Dockerfile, you’d be exposing yourself to 582 vulnerable system libraries bundled with the image. Another option is to use the node:10-slim image tag which provides slimmer images without unnecessary dependencies (for example: it omits the main pages and other assets). Choosing node:10-slim however would still pull in 71 vulnerable system libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most vulnerabilities originate in the base image you selected. For that reason, remediation should focus on base image fixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The node:10-alpine image is a better option to choose if you want a very small base image with a minimal set of system libraries. However, while no vulnerabilities were detected in the version of the Alpine image we tested, that’s not to say that it is necessarily free of security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpine Linux handles vulnerabilities differently than the other major distros, who prefer to backport sets of patches. At Alpine, they prefer rapid release cycles for their images, with each image release providing a system library upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8033&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121266/Number_of_vulnerabilities_by_node_image_tag.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number of vulnerabilities by node image tag&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; height=&quot;637&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Alpine Linux doesn’t maintain a security advisory program, which means that if a system library has vulnerabilities, Alpine Linux will not issue an official advisory about it; Alpine Linux will mitigate the vulnerability by creating a new base image version including a new version of that library that fixes the issue, if one is available (as opposed to backporting as mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that the newer fixed version, of a vulnerable library will be immediately available on Alpine Linux, although that is the case many times. Despite this, if you can safely move to the Alpine Linux version without breaking your application, you can reduce the attack surface of your environment because you will be using fewer libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of an image tag, like node:10, is in reality an alias to another image, which constantly rotates with new minor and patched versions of 10 as they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8034&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121369/Docker_terminal_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker terminal screenshot&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;860&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practice that some teams follow is to use a specific version tag instead of an alias so that their base image would be node:10.8.0-jessie for example. However, as newer releases of Node 10 are released, there is a good chance those newer images will include fewer system library vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Snyk Docker scanning features we found that when a project uses a specific version tag such as node:10.8.0-jessie, we could then recommend newer images that contain fewer vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported for system libraries, affecting some of the popular Linux distributions such as Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. In 2018 alone we tracked 1,597 vulnerabilities in system libraries with known CVEs assigned for these distros, which is more than four times the number of vulnerabilities compared to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8029&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551120743/Linux_OS_vulnerabilities_steadily_increasing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Linux OS vulnerabilities steadily increasing&quot; width=&quot;788&quot; height=&quot;562&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at the breakdown of vulnerabilities (high and critical) it is clear that this severity level is continuing to increase through 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8030&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551120779/High_and_critical_vulnerabilities_in_system_libraries.png&quot; alt=&quot;High and critical vulnerabilities in system libraries&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;713&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloudflare expands its government warrant canaries</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/cloudflare-warrant-canary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/cloudflare-warrant-canary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;When the government comes for your data, tech companies can’t always tell you. But thanks to a legal loophole, companies can say if they haven’t had a visit yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s opened up an interesting clause that allows companies to silently warn customers when the government turns up to secretly raid its stash of customer data without violating a gag order it. Under U.S. freedom of speech laws, companies can publicly say that “the government has not been here” when there has been no demand for data, but they are allowed to remove statements when a warrant comes in as a warning shot to anyone who pays attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These so-called “warrant canaries” — named for the poor canary down the mine that dies when there’s gas that humans can’t detect — are a key transparency tool that predominantly privacy-focused companies use to keep their customers aware of the goings-on behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where companies have abandoned their canaries or caved to legal pressure, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cloudflare&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; is bucking the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking and content delivery network giant said in a blog post this week that it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-update-joining-cloudflares-flock-of-warrant-canaries-2/&quot;&gt;expanding the transparency reports&lt;/a&gt; to include more canaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;has never turned over their SSL keys or customers’ SSL keys to anyone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never installed any law enforcement software or equipment anywhere on their network;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never provided any law enforcement organization a feed of customers’ content transiting their network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those key points are critical to the company’s business. A government demand &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/ladar-levison-finally-confirms-snowden-was-target-of-lavabit-investigation/&quot;&gt;for SSL keys&lt;/a&gt; and installing intercept equipment on its network would allow investigators unprecedented access to a customer’s communications and data, and undermine the company’s security. A similar demand led to Ladar Levison &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/ladar-levison-finally-confirms-snowden-was-target-of-lavabit-investigation/&quot;&gt;shutting down his email service Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; when they sought the keys to obtain information on whistleblower Edward Snowden, who used the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Cloudflare’s warrant canaries will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never modified customer content at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never modified the intended destination of DNS responses at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of its encryption at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also expanded and replaced its first canary to confirm that the company “has never turned over our encryption or authentication keys or our customers’ encryption or authentication keys to anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare said that if it were ever asked to do any of the above, the company would “exhaust all legal remedies” to protect customer data, and remove the statements from its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking and content delivery network is one of a handful of major companies that have used warrant canaries over the years. Following reports that the National Security Agency was vacuuming up the call records from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/nsa-att-intercept-surveillance/&quot;&gt;the major telecom giants in bulk&lt;/a&gt;, Apple included a statement in its most recent transparency reports noting that the company has to date “not received any orders for bulk data.” Reddit removed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/reddit-warrant-canary-hints-it-got-a-national-security-letter/&quot;&gt;its warrant canary in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that it had received a national security order it wasn’t permitted to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s expanded canaries were included in the company’s latest transparency report, out this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its latest figures covering the second half of 2018, Cloudflare responded to just seven subpoenas of the 19 requests, affecting 12 accounts and 309 domains. The company also responded to 44 court orders of the 55 requests, affecting 134 accounts and 19,265 domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company received between 0-249 national security requests for the duration, and didn’t process any wiretap or foreign government requests for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Zero – A fast, zero-configuration server for React, Node.js, Markdown</title>
<link>https://zeroserver.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://zeroserver.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; globally by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;npm install -g zero
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hello World&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start by making a website that tells us server time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to create an API endpoint in Node.js to tell us time in JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder and add a new file &lt;code&gt;time.js&lt;/code&gt; in that folder. In this file, export a function that accepts &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; objects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res&quot;&gt;like Express&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// time.js
const moment = require(&quot;moment&quot;)

module.exports = (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  var time = moment().format('LT');   // 11:51 AM
  res.send({time: time })
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once saved, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into that folder and start the server like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;zero
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running this command will automatically install any dependencies (like &lt;em&gt;momentjs&lt;/em&gt; here) and start the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open this URL in the browser: &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000/time&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just created an API endpoint 🎉:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://zeroserver.io/assets/images/timeapi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time API&quot; title=&quot;Time API&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the server running. Now let's consume our API from a React page, create a new file &lt;code&gt;index.jsx&lt;/code&gt; and add the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// index.jsx
import React from 'react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async getInitialProps(){
    var json = await fetch(&quot;/time&quot;).then((resp) =&amp;gt; resp.json())
    return {time: json.time}
  }

  render() {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Current time is: {this.props.time}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a standard React component. With one additional hook for initial data population:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getInitialProps&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; static method which is called by &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; when the page loads. This method can return a plain object which populates &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go to this URL: &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code&gt; and you should see the current server time rendered by React while &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;-ing an API endpoint you created earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://zeroserver.io/assets/images/timejsx.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time In React&quot; title=&quot;Time In React&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; automatically bundles your code and supports server-side rendering. You don't need to fiddle with webpack anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! You just created a web application.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wage Stagnation</title>
<link>https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Epistemic status: I am basing this on widely-accepted published research, but I can’t guarantee I’ve understood the research right or managed to emphasize/believe the right people. Some light editing to bring in important points people raised in the comments.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all know this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/main_graph.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median wages tracked productivity until 1973, then stopped. Productivity kept growing, but wages remained stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called “wage decoupling”. Sometimes people talk about wages decoupling from GDP, or from GDP per capita, but it all works out pretty much the same way. Increasing growth no longer produces increasing wages for ordinary workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this true? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What Does The Story Look Like Across Other Countries And Time Periods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a broader look, from 1800 on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/historical.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It no longer seems like a law of nature that productivity and wages are coupled before 1973. They seem to uncouple and recouple several times, with all the previous graphs’ starting point in 1950 being a period of unusual coupledness. Still, the modern uncoupling seems much bigger than anything that’s happened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about other countries? This graph is for the UK (you can tell because it spells “labor” as “labour”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/decoupling_uk.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks similar, except that the decoupling starts around 1990 instead of around 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s Europe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/decoupling_europe.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only from 1999 on, so it’s not that helpful. But it does show that even in this short period, France remains coupled, Germany is decoupled, Spain is…doing whatever Spain is doing, and Italy is so pathetic that the problem never even comes up. Overall not sure what to think about these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Could Apparent Wage Decoupling Be Because Of Health Insurance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with wages, workers are compensated in benefits like health insurance. Since health insurance has skyrocketed in price, this means total worker compensation has gone up much more than wages have. This could mean workers are really getting compensated much more, even though they’re being paid the same amount of money. This view has sometimes been associated with economist Glenn Hubbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few lines of argument that suggest it’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;First&lt;/u&gt;, wage growth has been worst for the lowest-paid workers. But the lowest-paid workers don’t usually get insurance at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/healthcare1.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/productivity_class.PNG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Second&lt;/u&gt;, the numbers don’t really add up. Median household income in 1973 was about $48,000 in today’s dollars. Since then, productivity has increased by between 70% and 140% (EVERYBODY DISAGREES ON THIS NUMBER), so if median income had kept pace with productivity it should be between $82,000 and $115,000. Instead, it is $59,000. So there are between $23,000 and $67,000 of missing income to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average health insurance policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/what-percent-of-health-insurance-is-paid-by-employers&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; about $7000 per individual or $20000 per family, of which employers pay $6000 and $14000 respectively. But as mentioned above, many people do not have employer-paid insurance at all, so the average per person cost is less than that. Usually only one member of a household will pay for family insurance, even if both members work; sometimes only one member of a household will buy insurance at all. So the average cost of insurance to a company per employee is well below the $6000 to $14000 number. If we round it off to $6000 per person, that only explains a quarter of the lowest estimate of the productivity gap, and less than a tenth of the highest estimate. So it’s unlikely that this is the main cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Third&lt;/u&gt;, some people have tried measuring productivity vs. total compensation, with broadly similar results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/epi_compensation.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/heritage_compensation.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/fed_compensation.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first graph is from the left-wing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/blog/professor-hubbards-claim-about-wage-and-compensation-stagnation-is-not-true/&quot;&gt;Economic Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt;, whose bias is towards proving that wage stagnation is real and important. The second graph is from the right-wing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/productivity-and-compensation-growing-together&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, whose bias is towards proving that wage stagnation is fake and irrelevant. The third graph is from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2016/08/12/labor-compensation-and-labor-productivity-recent-recoveries-and-the-long-term-trend/&quot;&gt;US Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, a perfectly benevolent view-from-nowhere institution whose only concern is the good of the American people. All three agree that going from earnings to total compensation alone closes only a small part of the gap. The EPI also mentions that most of the difference between earnings and compensation opened up in the 1960s and stayed stable thereafter (why? haven’t health insurance costs gone up more since then), which further defeats this as an explanation for post-1973 trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t dismiss this as irrelevant, because many things that close only a small part of the gap may, when added together, close a large part of the gap. But this doesn’t do much on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Could Apparent Wage Decoupling Be An Artifact Of Changing Demographics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demographics of the workforce have changed a lot since 1973; for example, more workers are women and minorities. If women and minorities get paid less, then as more of them enter the workforce, the lower “average” wages will go (without any individual getting paid less). If they gradually enter the workforce at the same rate that wages are increasing, this could look like wages being stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we disaggregate statistics by race and gender, we don’t see this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/the-great-male-stagnation.html&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; average male wage over the relevant time period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/male_income.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/28/these-seven-charts-show-the-black-white-economic-gap-hasnt-budged-in-50-years/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.3be74828d84f&quot;&gt;here’s&lt;/a&gt; average income disaggregated by race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/race_income.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patterns for whites and men are the same as the general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unusual thing in this area. &lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/the-great-male-stagnation.html&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; the pattern for women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/female_income.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s income is rising at almost the same rate as productivity! This is pretty interesting, but as far as I can tell it’s just because women’s career prospects have been improving over time because of shifting cultural attitudes, affirmative action, and the increasing dominance of female-friendly service and education-heavy jobs. I’m not sure this has any greater significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did increased female participation in the workforce increase the supply of labor and so drive the price of labor down? There’s a tiny bit of evidence for that &lt;a href=&quot;https://aneconomicsense.org/2016/03/20/there-is-no-reason-to-expect-increased-labor-force-participation-rates-to-be-a-source-of-spectacular-growth/&quot;&gt;in the data&lt;/a&gt;, which show female workforce participation started rising much faster around 1973, with a corresponding increase in total workforce. But this spurt trailed off relatively quickly, and female participation has been declining since about 2000, and the wage stagnation trend continues. I don’t want to rule out the possibility that this was part of what made 1973 in particular such a strong inflection point, but even if it was, it’s long since been overwhelmed by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Could Apparent Wage Decoupling Be An Artifact Of How We Measure Inflation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Feldstein is a Harvard economics professor, former head of the National Bureau of Economic Researchers, former head of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/feldstein/WAGESandPRODUCTIVITY.meetings2008.pdf&quot;&gt;He believes&lt;/a&gt; that apparent wage stagnation is an artifact of mismeasurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument is pretty hard for me to understand, but as best I can tell, it goes like this. In order to calculate wage growth since 1973, we take the nominal difference in wages, then adjust for inflation. We calculate wage inflation with something called the Consumer Price Index, which is the average price of lots of different goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to calculate productivity growth since 1973, we use a different index, the “nonfarm business sector output price index”, which is based on how much money companies get for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These should be similar if consumers are buying the same products that companies are making. But there can be some differences. For example, if you’re looking at US statistics only, then some businesses may be selling to foreign markets with different inflation rates, and some consumers may be buying imported goods from countries with different inflation rates. Also (and I’m not sure I understand this right), if people own houses, CPI pretends they are paying market rent to avoid ignoring housing costs, but PPI doesn’t do this. Also, PPI is not as good at including services as CPI. So consumer and producer price indexes differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, consumer inflation has been larger than producer inflation since 1973. So when we adjust wages for consumer inflation, they go way down, but when we adjust productivity for producer-inflation, it only goes down a little. This means that these different inflation indices make it look like productivity has risen much faster than wages, but actually they’ve risen the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per Feldstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of productivity doubled in the U.S. nonfarm business sectorbetween 1970 and 2006. Wages, or more accurately total compensation per hour, increased at approximately the same annual rate during that period if nominal compensation is adjusted for inflation in the same way as the nominal output measure that is used to calculate productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the doubling of productivity represented a 1.9 percent annual rate of increase. Real compensation per hour rose at 1.7 percent per year when nominal compensation is deflated using the same nonfarm business sector output price index. In the period since 2000, productivity rose much more rapidly (2.9 percent ayear) and compensation per hour rose nearly as fast (2.5 percent a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the CPI increasing so much faster than business-centered inflation indices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/price_indices.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/es/03/ES0305.pdf&quot;&gt;blames tech&lt;/a&gt;. The services-centered CPI has comparatively little technology. The goods-heavy PPI (a business-centered index of inflation) has a lot of it. Tech is going down in price (how much did a digital camera cost in 1990? How about now?) so the PPI stays very low while the CPI keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compensation/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it explains 34% of wage decoupling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/epi_feldstein.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right-leaning Heritage Foundation says it explains more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/heritage_feldstein.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we estimate the size of the gap as 70 pp (between total compensation CPI and productivity), switching to the top IPD measure closes 67% of the gap; switching to the PCE measure explains 37% of the gap. I’m confused because the EPI is supposedly based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csls.ca/ipm/23/IPM-23-Mishel-Gee.pdf&quot;&gt;Mishel and Gee&lt;/a&gt;, who say they have used the GDP deflator, which is the same thing as the IPD which the Heritage Foundation says they use. I think the difference is that Mishel and Gee haven’t already applied the change from wages to total compensation when they estimate percent of the gap closed? But I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other group has tried to calculate this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1246.pdf&quot;&gt;Pessoa and Van Reenan: Decoupling Of Wage Growth And Productivity Growth? Myth And Reality&lt;/a&gt;. According to a summary I read, they believe 40% of wage decoupling is because of these inflation related concerns, but I have trouble finding that number in the paper itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/65351/2000331-Beyond-the-Wage-Stagnation-Story.pdf&quot;&gt;the CBO looks into&lt;/a&gt; the same issue. They’re not talking about it relative to productivity, but they say that technical inflation issues mean that the standard wage stagnation story is false, and wages have really grown 41% from 1979 – 2013. Since productivity increased somewhere between 70% and 100% during that time, this seems similar to some of the other estimates – inflation technicalities explain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone I read seems to agree this issue exists and is interesting, but I’m not sure I entirely understand the implications. Some people say that this completely debunks the idea of wage decoupling and it’s actually only half or a third what the raw numbers say. Other people seem to agree that a big part of wage decoupling is these inflation technicalities, but suggest that although they have important technical implications, if you want to know how the average worker on the street is doing the CPI is still the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superstar economist Larry Summers (with Harvard student Anna Stansbury) comes the closest to having a real opinion on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://piie.com/system/files/documents/wp18-5.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investigating consumers’ experienced rise in living standards as in Bivens and Mishel (2015), a consumer price deflator is appropriate; however, as Feldstein (2008) argues, when investigating factor income shares a producer price deflator is more appropriate because it reflects the real cost to firms of employing workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a little confused by this. On the one hand, I do want to investigate consumers’ experienced rise (or lack thereof) in living standards. This is the whole point – the possibility that workers’ living standards haven’t risen since 1973. But most people nowadays work in services. If you deflate their wages with an index used mostly for goods, are you just being a moron and ensuring you will be inaccurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers and Stansbury continue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence (2016) analyzes this divergence more recently, comparing average compensation to net productivity, which is a more accurate reflection of the increase in income available for distribution to factors of production. Since depreciation has accelerated over recent decades, using gross productivity creates a misleadingly large divergence between productivity and compensation. Lawrence finds that net labor productivity and average compensation grew together until 2001, when they started to diverge i.e. the labor share started to fall. Many other studies also find a decline in the US labor share of income since about 2000, though the timing and magnitude is disputed (see for example Grossman et al 2017, Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Lawrence 2015, Elsby Hobijn and Sahin 2013, Rognlie 2015, Pessoa and Van Reenen 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I intepret this correctly, it looks like it’s saying that the real decoupling happened in 2000, not in 1973. I see a lot of papers saying the same thing, and I don’t understand where they’re diverging from the people who say it happened in 1973. Maybe they’re using Feldstein’s method of calculating inflation? I think this must be true – if you look at the Heritage Foundation graph above, “total compensation measured with Feldstein’s method” and productivity are exactly equal to their 1973 level in 2000, but diverge shortly thereafter so that today compensation has only grown 77% compared to productivity’s 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Summers and Stansbury go on to give basically exactly the same “Why have wages been basically stagnant since 1973? Why are they decoupled from productivity?” narrative as everyone else, so it sure doesn’t look like they think any of this has disproven that. It looks like maybe they think Feldstein is right in some way that doesn’t matter? But I don’t know enough economics to figure out what that way would be. And it looks like Feldstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/are-us-middle-class-incomes-stagnating-by-martin-feldstein-2015-07?barrier=accesspaylog&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; his rightness matters very much, and other economists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/03/the_bizarre_way.html&quot;&gt;Scott Sumner&lt;/a&gt; seem to agree. And I cannot find anyone, anywhere, who wants to come out and say explicitly that Feldstein’s argument is wrong and we should definitely measure wage stagnation the way everyone does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusions from this section, such as they are, go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Arcane technical points about inflation might explain between 33% and 66% of the apparent wage stagnation/decoupling.&lt;br/&gt;2. “Explain” may not mean the same as “explain away”, and it’s not completely clear how these points relate to anything we care about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Could Wage Decoupling Be Explained By Increasing Labor-Vs-Capital Inequality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists divide inequality into two types. Wage inequality is about how much different wage-earners (or salary-earners, here the terms are used interchangeably) make relative to each other. Labor-vs-capital inequality is about how much wage earners earn vs. how much capitalists get in profits. These capitalists are usually investors/shareholders, but can also be small business owners (or, sometimes, large business owners). Since tycoons like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg get most of their compensation from stocks, they count as “capitalists” even if they are paid some token salary for the work they do running their companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the labor-vs-capital split for the US over the relevant time period; note the very truncated vertical axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/labor_capital.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of inequality was about the same in the early 1970s as in the early 2000s, and has no clear inflection point around 1973, so it probably didn’t start this trend off. But it did start seriously decreasing around 2000, the same time people who use the more careful inflation methodology say wages and productivity &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; decoupled. And obviously labor getting less money in general is the sort of thing that makes wages go down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is labor-vs-capital inequality increasing? For the long story, read Piketty (&lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/24/book-review-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/26/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/&quot;&gt;highlights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/28/highlights-from-the-comments-on-piketty/&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;). But the short story includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s wage inequality is tomorrow’s labor-vs-capital inequality. If some people get paid more than others, they can invest, their savings will compound, and they will have more capital. As wage inequality increases (see below), labor-vs-capital inequality does too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry is more capital-intensive than labor-intensive. For example, Apple has 100,000 employees and makes $250 billion/year, compared to WalMart with 2 million employees and $500 billion/year – in other words, Apple makes $2.5 million per employee compared to Wal-Mart’s $250,000. Apple probably pays its employees more than Wal-Mart does, but not ten times more. So more of Apple’s revenue goes to capital compared to Wal-Mart’s. As tech becomes more important than traditional industries, capital’s share of the pie goes up. This is probably a big reason why capital has been doing so well since 2000 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an iconoclastic strain of thought that says most of the change in labor-vs-capital is just housing. Houses count as capital, so as housing costs rise, so does capital’s share of the economy. Read Matt Ronglie’s work (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mattrognlie.com/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/deciphering-the-fall-and-rise-in-the-net-capital-share/&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8320937/this-26-year-old-grad-student-didnt-really-debunk-piketty-but-what-he&quot;&gt;Voxsplainer&lt;/a&gt;) for more. Since houses are neither involved in corporate productivity nor in wages, I’m not sure how this affects wage-productivity decoupling if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, the papers I read suggest that increasing labor-vs-capital inequality explains maybe 10-20% of of decoupling, almost all concentrated in the 2000 – present period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Could Wage Decoupling Be Explained By Increasing Wage Inequality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part of the two-pronged inequality picture above. This one seems more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way economists look at this is in the difference between the &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt; wage and the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; wage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/epi_average.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add in the other things we talked about – the health insurance, the inflation technicalities, the declining share of labor – and the “””average””” worker is doing almost as well as they were in 1973. In fact, this is almost tautologically true. If the entire pie is growing by X amount, and labor’s relative share of the pie is staying the same, then labor should be getting the same absolute amount, and (ignoring changes in the number of laborers) the average laborer should get the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the decline in median wage is a mean vs. median issue. A few high-earners are taking a lot of the pie, keeping the mean constant but lowering the median. How high?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/epi_percent.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, productivity has grown by 70-100% through this period. So even though the top 5% have seen their incomes grow by 69%, they’re still not growing as fast as productivity. The top 1% have grown a bit faster than productivity, although still not that much. The top 0.1% are doing really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is generally considered the most important cause of wage stagnation and wage decoupling, other than among the iconoclasts who think the inflation issues are more important. Above, I referred to a few papers that tried to break down the importance of each cause. EPI thinks wage inequality explains 47% of the problem. Pessoa and Van Reenen think it explains more like 20% according to Mishel’s summary (my eyeballing of the paper suggests more like 33%, but I am pretty uncertain about this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Is Wage Inequality Increasing Because Of Technology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one story about why wage inequality is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days, people worked in factories. A slightly smarter factory worker might be able to run the machinery a little better, or do something else useful, but in the end everyone is working on the same machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern economy, factory workers are being replaced by robots. This creates very high demand for skilled roboticists, who get paid lots of money to run the robots in the most efficient way, and very low demand for factory workers, who need to be retrained to be fast food workers or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in the general case, technology separates people into the winners (the people who are good with technology and who can use it to do jobs that would have taken dozens or hundreds of people before) and the losers (people who are not good with technology, and so their jobs have been automated away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an OECD paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common explanations for increased wage inequality such as skill-biased technological change and globalisation cannot plausibly account for the disproportionate wage growth at the very top of the wage distribution. Skill-biased technological change and globalisation may both raise the relative demand for high-skilled workers, but this should be reflected in broadly rising relative wages of high-skilled workers rather than narrowly rising relative wagesof top-earners. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) argue that digitalisation leads to “winner-takes-most” dynamics, with innovators reaping outsize rewards as digital innovations are replicable at very low cost and have a global scale. Recent studies provide evidence consistent with “winner-take-most” dynamics, in the sense that productivity of firms at the technology frontier has diverged from the remaining firms and that market shares of frontier firms have increased (Andrews et al., 2016). This type of technological change may allow firms at the technology frontier to raise the wages of its key employees to “superstar” levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It…sounds like they’re saying that technological change can’t be the answer, then giving arguments for why the answer is technological change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is just the authors’ poor writing skills, and that the real argument is less confusing. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/great-decoupling-of-wages_b_7451212.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is surprisingly helpful, describing it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that skilled professionals are not just winning out over working class stiffs, but the richest of the top 0.01 percent are winning out over the professional class as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://piie.com/system/files/documents/wp18-5.pdf&quot;&gt;That Larry Summers paper&lt;/a&gt; mentioned before becomes relevant here again. It argues that wages and productivity are not decoupled – which I know is a pretty explosive thing to say three thousand words in to an essay on wage decoupling, but let’s hear him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that apparent decoupling between productivity and wages could result either from literal decoupling – that is, none of the gains of increasing productivity going to workers – or from unrelated trends – for example, increasing productivity giving workers an extra $1000 at the same time as something else causes workers to lose $1000. If a company made $1000 extra and the boss pocketed all of it and didn’t give workers any, that would be literal decoupling. If a company made $1000 extra, it gave workers $1000 extra, but globalization means there’s less demand for workers and so salaries would otherwise have dropped by $1000, so now they stay the same, that’s an unrelated trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers and Stansbury investigate this by seeing if wages increase more during the short periods between 1973 and today when productivity is unusually high, and if they stagnate more (or decline) during the short periods when it is unusually low. They find this is mostly true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find substantial evidence of linkage between productivity and compensation: Over 1973–2016, one percentage point higher productivity growth has been associated with 0.7 to 1 percentage points higher median and average compensation growth and with 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points higher production/nonsupervisory compensation growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;S are very careful in this paper and have already adjusted for health insurance issues and inflation calculation issues. They find that once you adjust for this, productivity and wages are between 40% and 100% coupled, depending on what measure you use. (I don’t exactly understand the difference between the two measures they give; surely taking the median worker is already letting you consider inequality and you shouldn’t get so much of a difference by focusing on nonsupervisory workers?) As mentioned before, they finds the coupling is much less since 2000. They also find similar results in most other countries: whether or not those countries show apparent decoupling, they remain pretty coupled in terms of actual productivity growth:wage growth correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argue that if technology/automation were causing rising wage inequality or rising labor-capital inequality, then median wage should decouple from productivity fastest during the periods of highest productivity growth. After all, productivity growth represents the advance of labor-saving technology. So periods of high productivity growth are those where the most new technology and automation are being deployed, so if this is what’s driving wages down, wages should decrease fastest during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They test this a couple of different ways, and find that it is false before the year 2000, but somewhat true afterwards, mostly through labor-capital inequality. They don’t really find that technology drives wage inequality at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why technology would mean decoupling happens fastest during the highest productivity growth. But I’m not sure I understand what they mean when they say there is no decoupling and productivity growth translates into wage growth? Shouldn’t this disprove &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; posited causes of decoupling so far, including policy-based wage inequality? I’m not sure. S&amp;amp;S don’t seem to think so, but I’m not sure why. Overall I find this paper confusing, but I assume its authors know what they’re doing so I will accept its conclusions as presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like, although technology probably explains some top-10% people doing moderately better than the rest, it doesn’t explain the stratospheric increase in the share of the 1%, which is where most of the story lies. I would be content to dismiss this as unimportant, except that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/wage_igm.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…all the world’s leading economists disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe when they say “income inequality”, they’re talking about a more intuitive view of income inequality where some programmers make $150K and some factory workers make $30K and this is unequal and that’s important – even though it is not related to the larger problem of why everybody except the top 1% is making much less than predicted. I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about dismissing so many things as “probably responsible for a few percent of the problem”. It seems like a cop-out when it’s hard to decide whether something is really important or not. But my best guess is still that this is probably responsible for a few percent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Is Wage Inequality Increasing Because Of Policy Changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! We are every think tank in the world! We hear you are wondering whether wage inequality is increasing because of policy changes! Can we offer you nine billion articles proving that it definitely is, and you should definitely be very angry? Please can we offer you articles? Pleeeeeeeeaaase?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations of this theory usually involve some combination of policies – decreasing union power, low minimum wages, greater acceptance of very high CEO salary – that concentrate all gains in the highest-paid workers, usually CEOs and executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have trouble making the numbers add up. Vox has a cute thought experiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5970815/what-if-walmarts-ceo-took-a-pay-cut-for-his-workers&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where they imagine the CEO of Wal-Mart redistributing his entire salary to all Wal-Mart workers equally, possibly after having been visited by three spirits. Each Wal-Mart employee would make an extra $10. If the spirits visited all top Wal-Mart executives instead of just the CEO, the average employee would get $30. This is obviously not going to single-handedly bring them to the middle-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vox uses such a limited definition of “top executive” that only five people are included. What about Wal-Mart’s 1%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wal-Mart 1% will include 20,000 people. To reach the 1% in the US, you need to make $400,000 per year; I would expect Wal-Mart’s 1% to be lower, since Wal-Mart is famously a bad place to work that doesn’t pay people much. Let’s say $200,000. That means the Wal-Mart 1% makes a total of $4 billion. If their salary were distributed to all 2 million employees, those employees would make an extra $2,000 per year; maybe a 10% pay raise. And of course even in a perfectly functional economy, we couldn’t pay Wal-Mart management literally $0, so the real number would be less than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the problem is that Wal-Mart is just an unusually employee-heavy company. What about Apple? Their CEO makes $12 million per year. If that were distributed to their 132,000 employees, they would each make an extra $90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many total high-paid executives does Apple have? It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-amazon-hiring-mbas-2017-4&quot;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; Apple hires up to 130 MBAs from top business schools per year; if we imagine they last 10 years each, they might have 1000 such people, making them a “top 1%”. If these people get paid $500,000 each, they could earn 500 million total. That’s enough to redistribute $4,000 to all Apple employees, which still isn’t satisfying given the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters bring up the possibility that I’m missing stocks and stock options, which make up most of the compensation of top executives. I’m not sure whether this gets classified as income (in which case it could help explain income inequality) or as capital (in which case it would get filed under labor-vs-capital inequality). I’m also not sure whether Apple giving Tim Cook lots of stocks takes money out of the salary budget that could have gone to workers instead. For now let’s just accept that the difference between mean and median income shows that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; has to be happening to drive up the top 1% or so of salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What policies are most likely to have caused this concentration of salaries at the top?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/union.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people point to a decline in unions. This decline does not really line up with the relevant time period – it started in the early 1960s, when productivity and wages were still closely coupled. But it could be a possible contributor. Economics Policy Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/publication/union-decline-lowers-wages-of-nonunion-workers-the-overlooked-reason-why-wages-are-stuck-and-inequality-is-growing/&quot;&gt;cites some work&lt;/a&gt; saying it may explain up to 10% of decoupling &lt;em&gt;even for non-union members&lt;/em&gt;, since the deals struck by unions set norms that spread throughout their industries. A group of respected economists including David Card &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w9473.pdf&quot;&gt;looks into the issue&lt;/a&gt; and finds similar results, saying that the decline of unions may explain about 14% or more of increasing wage inequality (remember that wage inequality is only about 40% of decoupling, so this would mean it only explains about 5% of decoupling). The conservative Heritage Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy&quot;&gt;has many bad things to say about unions&lt;/a&gt; but grudgingly admits they may raise salaries by up to 10% among members (they don’t address non-members). Based on all this, it seems plausible that deunionization may explain about 5-10% of decoupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another relevant policy that could be shaping this issue is the minimum wage. EPI notes that although the minimum wage never goes down in nominal terms, if it doesn’t go up then it’s effectively going down in real terms and relative to productivity. This certainly sounds like the sort of thing that could increase wage inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/minimum_wage.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s look at that graph by percentiles again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/epi_percent.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wage stagnation is barely any better for the 90th percentile worker than it is for the people at the bottom. And the 90th percentile worker isn’t making minimum wage. This may be another one that adds a percentage point here and there, but it doesn’t seem too important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t find anything about it on EPI, but Thomas Piketty thinks that tax changes were an important driver of wage inequality. I’ll quote my previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/24/book-review-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/&quot;&gt;review of his book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks that executive salaries have increased because – basically – corporate governance isn’t good enough to prevent executives from giving themselves very high salaries. Why didn’t executives give themselves such high salaries before? Because before the 1980s the US had a top tax rate of 80% to 90%. As theory predicts, people become less interested in making money when the government’s going to take 90% of it, so executives didn’t bother pulling the strings it would take to have stratospheric salaries. Once the top tax rate was decreased, it became worth executives’ time to figure out how to game the system, so they did. This is less common outside the Anglosphere because other countries have different forms of corporate governance and taxation that discourage this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piketty does some work to show that increasing wage inequality in different countries is correlated with those countries’ corporate governance and taxation policies. I don’t know if anyone has checked how that affects wage decoupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Contrary to the usual story, wages have not stagnated since 1973. Measurement issues, including wages vs. benefits and different inflation measurements, have made things look worse than they are. Depending on how you prefer to think about inflation, median wages have probably risen about 40% – 50% since 1973, about half as much as productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. This leaves about a 50% real decoupling between median wages and productivity, which is still enough to be serious and scary. The most important factor here is probably increasing wage inequality. Increasing labor-capital inequality is a less important but still significant factor, and it has become more significant since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Increasing wage inequality probably has a lot to do with issues of taxation and corporate governance, and to some degree also with issues surrounding unionization. It probably has less to do with increasing technology and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. If you were to put a gun to my head and force me to break down the importance of various factors in contributing to wage decoupling, it would look something like (warning: very low confidence!) this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Inflation miscalculations: 35%&lt;br/&gt;– Wages vs. total compensation: 10%&lt;br/&gt;– Increasing labor vs. capital inequality: 15%&lt;br/&gt;—- (Because of automation: 7.5%)&lt;br/&gt;—- (Because of policy: 7.5%)&lt;br/&gt;– Increasing wage inequality: 40%&lt;br/&gt;—- (Because of deunionization: 10%)&lt;br/&gt;—- (Because of policies permitting high executive salaries: 20%)&lt;br/&gt;—- (Because of globalization and automation: 10%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprises me, because the dramatic shift in 1973 made me expect to see a single cause (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/14/how-likely-are-multifactorial-trends/&quot;&gt;multifactorial trends should be rare in general&lt;/a&gt;, maybe, I think). It looks like there are two reasons why 1973 seems more important than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, most graphs trying to present this data begin around 1950. If they had begun much earlier than 1950, they would have showed several historical decouplings and recouplings that make a decoupling in any one year seem less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, 1973 was the year of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis&quot;&gt;1973 Oil Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the fall of Bretton Woods, and the end of the gold standard, causing a general discombobulation to the economy that lasted a couple of years. By the time the economy recombobulated itself again, a lot of trends had the chance to get going or switch direction. For example, here’s inflation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cpi_history.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Inflation issues and wage inequality were probably most important in the first half of the period being studied. Labor-vs-capital inequality was probably most important in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Continuing issues that confuse me:&lt;br/&gt;– How much should we care about the difference between inflation indices? If we agree that using CPI to calculate this is dumb, should we cut our mental picture of the size of the problem in half?&lt;br/&gt;– Why is there such a difference between the Heritage Foundation’s estimate of how much of the gap inconsistent deflators explain (67%) and the EPI’s (34%)? Who is right?&lt;br/&gt;– Does the Summers &amp;amp; Stansbury paper argue against policy-based wage inequality as a cause of median wage stagnation, at least until 2000?&lt;br/&gt;– Are there enough high-paid executives at companies that, if their money were redistributed to all employees, their compensation would have increased significantly more in step with productivity? If so, where are they hiding? If not, what does “increasing wage inequality explains X% of decoupling” mean?&lt;br/&gt;– What caused past episodes of wage decoupling in the US? What ended them?&lt;br/&gt;– How do we square the apparent multifactorial nature of wage decoupling with its sudden beginning in 1973 and with the general argument against multifactorial trends?&lt;/p&gt;
