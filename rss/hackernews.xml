<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Apple U1 chip, and why is it important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest Apple announcement today was what Apple actually didn’t announce—yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey Siri, we lost Spot the dog, do you know where he is?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri:”Spot is located 87 feet forward and down 2 feet from the height of the iPhone. Please hold up your phone and follow the Balloon to Spot’s location”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Today September 10th, 2019 Apple announced the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro series of phones. Not mentioned on the stage, but briefly shown on the screen during Phil Schiller’s presentation was the new Apple U1 chip. Hidden in plain sight much like how he pre announced Apple Pay, we see the Apple U1 Chip for the world to see, yet most missed until after the event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;In 2012 Phil did precisely the same thing during the announcement of TouchID as a credit card machine, a Hypercom device [0], was presented on the screen as a potential use case for TouchID. I wrote this would be a nearly 100% confirmation of what became Apple Pay (I called it the iWallet, I know very 2012 of me). Many folks in the payment industry including disruptive startups thought me insane and went about becoming redundant when Apple Pay was released. Of course I had far more basis than a single Phil image. History is about to repeat itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Why was the Apple U1 chip on a graphic behind Phil and not announced overtly and only lightly mentioned on the Apple website? We will explore this in more detail at the end. Yet the first mention of how Apple will use the U1 Chip was presented on Apple’s own website as a new highly directional version of AirDrop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The text on Apple’s website for iPhone 11 series says it all:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra Wideband technology comes to iPhone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The new Apple‑designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness — allowing iPhone 11 to precisely locate other U1‑equipped Apple devices. Think GPS at the scale of your living room. So if you want to share a file with someone using AirDrop, just point your iPhone at theirs and they’ll be first on the list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;And:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you be more precise? Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The new Apple‑designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness — allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1‑equipped Apple devices. It’s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it’s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;With U1 and iOS 13, you can point your iPhone toward someone else’s, and AirDrop will prioritize that device so you can share files faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;And that’s just the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Ultra-Wide Band Radio Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The “U” in the U1 chip relates to the Ultra-Wide Band Radio Technology (UWB) [1] technology it uses. UWB can be used for many application and use cases. One use case that will become very large for Apple as they move to AR/MR technology and Apple Glasses is to be able to track spacial relationships of objects. One way to do this is using lasers and IR systems, and Apple is already doing this to some degree with FaceID and Animoji. The other way to do this is via the radio spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The early version of this was used in an all but abandoned Apple initiative called iBeacons [2]. This technology was centered around Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The idea was sound, however the technology was low resolution, so low that it would be hard to be with-in a few feet without triangleization of 3 or more iBeacons and even then it can drift significantly with heat and obstacle issues. Parallel to the iBeacon research,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Apple was testing a newer and more exacting technology in their research labs in 2005. By 2006, before the iPhone was even announced, they applied for a patent for “Ultra-wideband radios for time-of-flight-ranging and network position estimation” via a research grant at Livermore Labs. It took until September 2010 for the patent application to be released by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Apple went on to do a lot of work with iBeacons and BLE. However, the 3 dimensional spacial resolution was not nearly as accurate as Apple will come to need and thus they abandoned the concept of the iBeacon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Smoking Gun” Apple UWB Patents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;More recently Apple has applied for a few more patents centered around UWB. Inventor Joachim S. Hammerschmidt has developed some amazing extension of this technology. Apple inventor Benjamin Vigier has also contributed greatly to the UWB beacon concept. Joachim is a bit of an Apple patent savant submitting a few dozen patents on UWB and other radio frequency technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Even though the concepts of UWB has been around since the dawn of radio first developed in a useable way by RCA in the 1950s, the miniaturization and low power chips has it taken on this new form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;I have surfaced three very interesting Apple patents centered around UWB that most have overlooked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Clearly Apple had predicted the need for UWB as far back as the early 2000s. There are more Apple patents that relate to this technology, but these give an interesting overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;This invention provides a novel high-accuracy indoor ranging device that uses ultra-wideband (UWB) RF pulsing with low-power and low-cost electronics. A unique of the present invention is that it exploits multiple measurements in time and space for very accurate ranging. The wideband radio signals utilized herein are particularly suited to ranging in harsh RF environments because they allow signal reconstruction in spite of multipath propagation distortion. Furthermore, the ranging and positioning techniques discussed herein directly address many of the known technical challenges encountered in UWB localization regarding synchronization and sampling. In the method developed, noisy, corrupted signals can be recovered by repeating range measurements across a channel, and the distance measurements are combined from many locations surrounding the target in a way that minimizes the range biases associated to indirect flight paths and through-wall propagation delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Embodiments enable communicating Ultra Wideband (UWB) devices to collaborate by exchanging pulse shape information. The UWB devices use the pulse shape information to improve ranging accuracy. The improved ranging accuracy can be used in complex multipath environments where advanced estimation schemes are used to extract an arriving path for time-of-flight estimation. To determine the pulse shape information to be shared, some embodiments include determining location information of a UWB device and selecting the pulse shape information that satisfies regional aspects. The pulse shape information includes a time-zero index specific to a ranging signal that is used by UWB receivers to establish timestamps time-of-flight calculations. Some embodiments include measuring performance characteristics and selecting different pulse shape information based on the performance characteristics for improved accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;In the “Pulse Shaping Interoperability Protocol for Ultra Wideband Systems” Apple patent we find very enlighten embodiments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;[0021] Precise knowledge of pulse shape information used at a station's transmitter allows the use of receivers that isolate pulse shaping or other filtering effects from true propagation channel effects. Knowledge of the pulse shape information also allows the use of signal processing techniques that may be referred to as &quot;deconvolution&quot; techniques--methods to look at an overall received signal (e.g., end-to-end impulse response from transmitter to receiver) and factor out known artifacts such as, for example, transmitter pulse shaping including antenna effects or receiver transfer characteristics. These signal processing techniques allow extraction of a desired contribution of a wireless propagation channel in the overall system response; in turn, this extraction can be used to determine a time instant of an arriving propagation path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Other embodiments present an example system that may include but is not limited to &lt;strong&gt;UWB devices such as wireless communication devices (iPhones # 110 and 120), vehicular transponder device (#130), entry transponder device for doors (#140), a household device (#150 thermostat), pet leash tag (#160), and anchor nodes l70a­l70c.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;I have been studying patents for over 35 years and in particular Apple patents. The Apple UWB patents have been of great interest to me as I knew UWB will become not only an indoor mapping system, like GPS for indoor spaces, it will become crucial to AR/MR/VR environments for fine tuning of spacial coordinates. UWB will also be very useful with automobiles, drones, robotic systems. I wrote a few reports for clients and one VC commented that “this would forever change the way we view indoor spaces”, I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;These Apple patents are a potpourri of ways Apple can and very likely will use UWB. I could literally write a book on how this will play out for Apple just via these patents. Some of what I have learned since 2010 I will use in this answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Apple UWB Personal Radar System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;UWB can also serve as a sort of personal radar that can self reference the waves it sends out and echo locate your spacial world with a high degree of precision. I can see this as one way to avert some folks hunched over and thumb clawing at the screen walking down the street and the iPhone puts up a notification of nan imminent collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen of a whimsical radar screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Although humorous, if Apple makes this into an open standard, and there is some evidence some aspects may become open sourced, imagine a world where UWBs are in all automobiles and pedestrians. The collision detection and avoidance systems can become very powerful, and save many lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does UWB Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;UWB devices to collaborate with each other by exchanging pulsed shapes of information that can be used for a future ranging exchange. This is achieved by the receiving UWB devices using the pulse shape information to improve the ranging accuracy. The improved ranging accuracy can be used in complex multi-path environments where advanced estimation schemes are used to extract an arriving path for time-of-flight estimation. Time-of-flight is the basis of how UWB works, very much like GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The pulse shape information includes a time-zero index specific to a received ranging signal that is used by UWB receivers to establish timestamps for time-of-flight calculations.This includes measuring performance characteristics and selecting different pulse shape information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The UWB receiving pulse shape information from other devices, where the pulse shape information is used in UWB communications between the electronic device and the another electronic device, receiving a ranging signal that uses first pulse shape information, and determining a distance between the electronic device and the another electronic device based at least in part on the pulse shape information and the ranging signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Thus determining the distance includes calculating a time-of-flight associated with the ranging signal and the pulse shape information includes a time-zero index that may be a sample of a main lobe of the pulse shape information (e.g., a first sample or a center sample of a main lobe of the pulse shape information.) The pulse shape information also satisfies one or more regional aspects associated with location information of the electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;One or more of the anchor nodes may be used in conjunction with an iPhone or other device to improve the accuracy and reliability of ranging. The devices may triangulate and determine a geographic location that may be used to provide local direction information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The primary UWB can also serve as it’s own Anchor Node and self reference the ranging signal pattern itself. Very much like personal radar systems this may not have the same high resolution as using two or more devices to triangulate, it can be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple U1 Chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The Apple U1 chip is a application specific low power chip design very much like the new Decawave impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) DW1000 Radio IC chip set. They have sold millions of these chips thus far and has better than 10 centimeters guaranteed indoor accuracy. It is very possible the Apple U1 chip uses the Decawave chip, licensed technology or a customized OEM version. It is possible to achieve better than 3 centimeters of accuracy in theory with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen Decawave DW1000 chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The Decawave DW1000 Radio IC [3] for example, can move 6.8Mbps of data with an accuracy that is 100x better than WiFi or Bluetooth. It can reach 290 meters of distance with a very minimal power requirement with a 50x faster speed compared to standard GPS latency. Although the Apple U1 chip is not yet released, I suspect we will expect the same or better specifications. Thus based on the DW1000 as the base, we can imagine just how important the Apple U1 will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen Apple U1 Chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Although Apple only mentioned indirectly the U1 chip in the new iPhone 11 series, I think it is likely to be a part of Apple Watch Series 5. And if not yet in Apple Watch Series 5, it will be in a future version. I also imagine the U1 in AirPods, AirPod cases, Apple Glasses, MacBook Pros and of course in a stand alone device similar to the Tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen Apple U1 Chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The very low battery consumption of the U1 chip may make it possible for a single coin cell hearing aid battery to have a life of a year or more in normal settings. It is also possible to use the ambient radio frequencies that surround all of us to charge the battery using the patented technology from the Apple acquired company Passif [4]. It seems a very natural use case for Passif technology and was once used to power early internal testing of iBeacons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f1c9b98d3446c13fc8bd2bd490e3925&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c53eb90205694c5256ca8de5daaa616d&quot; master_w=&quot;1127&quot; master_h=&quot;349&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen of UWB topography.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Using the very low power consumption of the Apple U1 Chip and Passif ambient radio wave battery charging, it seems that we may see a less than 2 inch disc, what I will call this  Locate or AppleLocate (internally called Rose Tag by Apple), device in the market. It seems the existence of AppleLocate was revealed in iPhone Find My app. Thus it seems very likely one of the first things we see utilizing the U1 chip, outside of the iPhone 11 series is this new device. Many have speculated this would be a stand alone device and today this seems to be the case. I have asserted this technology would come about since 2012 originally as iBeacons and later as UWB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fa4f2ee4b29c2f20515ad2a70c4dfeaf&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ecc82587b6eea041c60c1a03a863f92d&quot; master_w=&quot;1600&quot; master_h=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Specimen of the  Locate or AppleLocate image found in Apple software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The AppleLocate tags will be relatively inexpensive, starting at about $20 and likely drifting to less than $2 in high production, it seems likely it will become widely used for countless reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;We will thus see AppleLocate tags in just about all Apple devices at some point for very precise location tracking and perimeter fencing. For example, you can be notified when the AppleLocate tag has entered or left an area as well as the U! chip built into other Apple devices. It will become orders of magnitude more difficult to steal an Apple product in the future with perimeter fencing breech notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HyperLocal And HyperPrivate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;It is entirely possible to build a useful AR/MR/VR map of any indoor space using the Apple U1 chip in just a few minutes few minutes. This can be utilized with the same laser and/or IR technology found in the iPhone for FaceID. &lt;strong&gt;Thus with a combinations of the Apple U1 chip and Apple A13 Bionic neural engine we will have one of the most sophisticated spacial mapping and analyzing systems in any currently available consumer device.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Indoor mapping has been tried via many methods over the years, including using the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner systems. Roomba met with a great deal of push back by users of their products when it was discovered the company may be selling indoor maps of the user’s homes [5] using SLAM technology. In the case of Apple, the U1 chip along with the results of FaceID/TouchID system is stored in the Secure Enclave. The data stored in the Secure Enclave is physically, nearly impossible to retrieve from the chip and is held only local to the device fully encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;There will be endless allegations that Apple is trying to collect and sell the results of indoor mapping and other telemetries from the Apple U1 Chip, but this will not be the case. Apple simply does not have access to the information and could not use it with out you suppling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;It seems very likely Apple will open up some of the abilities of the Apple U1 chip to developers. This will of course be by explicit permissions granted to the developer much like sharing location data. However I feel strongly Apple will never let a free flow of U! chip data be shared with any developer app. The opportunities with a well crafted API supply by Apple can be quite amazing. From AR use case to collision avoidance systems and just about everything in-between, this will become a very interesting new frontier for Apple developers. I think we will begin to see the API by the Apple World Wide Developer Conference 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Glasses: The Held And Worn New Software Version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;More than anything else, the Apple U1 Chip helps telegraph the Apple Glasses AR/MR platform. Internally at Apple this is known under a few names, Project StarBoard is linked to the first generations of Apple Glasses&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The ARDisplayDevice SDK in iPhoneOS 13 also clearly confirms an external AR/MR display device. The first versions will use the iPhone 11 Series as a tether base—wirelessly. &lt;strong&gt;Much like Apple Watch and Apple CarPlay the Apple Glasses will interact and interplay with full apps on the iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;. There is likely to be an Apple U1 Chip built-in to the Apple Glasses as well as new Siri chips and Bone Conduction sound chip Apple has been working on. The Apple U1 Chip on the Apple Glasses and on the iPhone will work together as node anchors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab04c410a4477459218836d013dc012d&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab04c410a4477459218836d013dc012d&quot; master_w=&quot;474&quot; master_h=&quot;266&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specimen of a hypothetical Apple Glasses display monitor using AriPlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Apple will allow for two versions of the same code to run. Called held as in the iPhone and worn as in Apple glasses. And like CarPlay the worn version for the first generations of Apple glasses will have less information. Apple has slowly been adding features that will use Apple Glasses in Apple Maps, Find My app and other Apple apps to help build the infrastructure and early developer interest in Apple Glasses. Thus as we see use cases slowly rolled out by Apple for the Apple U1 Chip, imagine how it will related to Apple Glasses. As this slowly plays out, it will become abundantly clear how deeply Apple has been thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Pay, Retail and Industrial Uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;As I mentioned, there will be countless new use cases for the Apple U1 Chip. I built the first and still the largest Apple Pay Map in the world, PayFinders [6]. One of my challenges was to push a notification to the iPhone user’s phone when they were inside the business, but also close to the checkout. In large stores like Target, I had great accuracy. However In smaller stores the boundaries were in and sometimes near the store. I urged Apple to use Bluetooth at top line merchants to help users know where an Apple Pay Credit Card machine was located and operational. My research showed people just did not want to ask or even test in most circumstances. With the AppleLocate tags on Credit Card Machines, the Apple Pay user can be directed precisely to with-in a few millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The same can be said of product locations. The “Beacon Triggered Processes” Apple patent just released on September 5th, 2019 goes a long way on how the Apple U1 Chip will be used with Apple Pay to begin and complete a sale. Apple Stores are already testing AppleLocate tags in their stores today. Although it takes some interesting radio frequency equipment to find them, I have been successful at two locations. The use case will allow for you to find a product like you world on a website with a whimsical Balloon, also used in the Find My app, to direct you to the precise location of the Apple product. With FaceID and Apple Pay you just look at your phone and confirm and leave. It is not hard to imagine many retail businesses adopting the system. It is also not hard to imagine AppleLocate used in industrial locations and medical locations. I will have much to say about this over the next few months as I have studied these use cases in depth for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Sourced Apple UWB Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;I think it is likely some of the technology around the AppleLocate system and the Apple U1 Chip will be open sourced for adoption of other companies. Much like elements of AirPlay it would make a great deal of sense for Apple to get as many manufactures to adopt this system as possible. &lt;strong&gt;Apple is light years ahead of Google, Samsung and Amazon in intellectual property and public patents that would give them a big edge in home automation and help guide Siri to a more favorable position in the home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculative But Very Likely Use Cases Of The Apple U1 Chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;I have written a few reports over the last few years on how UWB technology will be used in the future. I presented the rather certain use cases in this article, however there will be many others. Time and space constraints presented here I will mention a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin wallets and merchant payment systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical biometrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice First HyperLocal HyperContextual systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Apple Did Not Announce The U1 Chip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;So with all of these amazing attributes, why did Apple not announce the Apple A1 Chip? I assert it is a confluence of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The iPhoneOS software needed is not yet released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple will release AppleLocate tags for holiday shopping 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple had too many things to announce at this Apple Event and this would take too much time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple is aware of the privacy implication many will cast and wants to spend more time to explain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other issues I can not present at this moment in time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Thus it was not in the cards to hear anyone on the stage talk about the Apple U1 Chip but it certainly was presented behind Phil during his time on the stage and later indirectly communicated as part of a new version of “directional” AirDrop. Some people find it intriguing that AirDrop will use the Apple U1 Chip, however it will make much more sense how AirDrop will work in an AR/MR world that is on the map for Apple. In the mean time, being able to precisely locate via people and device via AirDrop will allow for new ways to send larger amounts of private and encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The findable abilities of the U1 chip will bridge across a multitude of Apple systems and software. It begins with AirDrop:, the largest file sharing social media network for the 14-23 age cohort. Quite hidden on campuses across the US AirDrop and Apple Messages serve as an ad-hoc HyperLocal HyperPrivate social network. Built into all new iPhones is this new permission based HyperLocal Social Network with permission based people finder systems built-in. Before we hear how bad this is, understand this is permission based and by invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The new AirDrop will allow for extremely high resolution to discover and send files and other new elements to friends and devices in a room. The precision is within millimeters. This will be achieved by simply pointing the phone in the direction of the person and a screen animation will allow in a held or worn (think Apple glasses) position to visualize the direction and avatar of the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;We may begin to see the Apple U1 Chip take shape as early as September 30th, 2019 but more likely over the last quarter of 2019 on to the announcements of Apple Glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Biggest Apple Announcement Today Was What Apple Actually Didn’t Announce—Yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The accelerometer systems, GPS systems and IR proximity sensors of the first iPhone helped define the last generation of products. The Apple U1 Chip will be a material part of defining the next generation of Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;I feel rather strongly the Apple U1 Chip, over time will be seen as one of the most important aspect of the September 10th, 2019 Apple Event. We will see it as the start of the HyperLocal world of computing that ultimately will lead to less of a need for the cloud. The Apple A1 Chip is the start of this process of HyperLocal and HyperContextual computing where holographic crystal memory [7] and very fast local computer speed will render the cloud as we know it redundant and far less useful. With Petabytes of data on every device, all of your data and a useful base of the Internet will be local in a chip, on the device. This is far more than the speculated IoT edge computing and the Apple U1 Chip is one important part to bring this about. We will once again leave the Mainframe computer and become cloudless.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Physicists finally nail the proton’s size, eliminating an anomaly</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-finally-nail-the-protons-size-and-hope-dies-20190911/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-finally-nail-the-protons-size-and-hope-dies-20190911/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2010, physicists in Germany &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09250&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that they had made an exceptionally precise measurement of the size of the proton, the positively charged building block of atomic nuclei. The result was very puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpq.mpg.de/4744848/pohl&quot;&gt;Randolf Pohl&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and collaborators had measured the proton using special hydrogen atoms in which the electron that normally orbits the proton was replaced by a muon, a particle that’s identical to the electron but 207 times heavier. Pohl’s team found the muon-orbited protons to be 0.84 femtometers in radius — 4% smaller than those in regular hydrogen, according to the average of more than two dozen earlier measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the discrepancy was real, meaning protons really shrink in the presence of muons, this would imply unknown physical interactions between protons and muons — a fundamental discovery. Hundreds of papers speculating about the possibility have been written in the near-decade since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hopes that the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/proton-radius-puzzle-deepens-with-new-measurement-20160811/&quot;&gt;proton radius puzzle&lt;/a&gt;” would upend particle physics and reveal new laws of nature have now been dashed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/1007&quot;&gt;a new measurement reported on Sept. 6 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Pohl’s muonic hydrogen result nine years ago, a team of physicists led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physics.yorku.ca/faculty-profiles/hessels-eric/&quot;&gt;Eric Hessels&lt;/a&gt; of York University in Toronto set out to remeasure the proton in regular, “electronic” hydrogen. Finally, the results are in: Hessels and company have pegged the proton’s radius at 0.833 femtometers, give or take 0.01, a measurement exactly consistent with Pohl’s value. Both measurements are more precise than earlier attempts, and they suggest that the proton does not change size depending on context; rather, the old measurements using electronic hydrogen were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pohl, who first heard about Hessels’ preliminary finding at a workshop in the summer of 2018, called it “a fantastic result,” albeit one that “points to the most mundane explanation” of the proton radius puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Hessels said he and his colleagues were very pleased that their measurement “agreed with the very accurate measurement in muonic hydrogen,” even if the result is somewhat bittersweet. “We know that we don’t understand all the laws of physics yet,” he said, “so we have to chase down all of these things that might give us hints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proton’s radius was not trivial to chase down. To deduce its value, Hessels and colleagues had to measure the Lamb shift: the difference between hydrogen’s first and second excited energy levels, called the 2S and 2P states. Hessels said he has wanted to measure the Lamb shift since he was an undergraduate in the 1980s, but the proton radius puzzle finally gave him the impetus to do so. “It’s an extremely difficult measurement,” he said. “I needed a good reason.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lamb shift, named for the American physicist Willis Lamb, who first attempted to measure it in 1947, reveals the proton’s radius in the following way: When an electron orbits the proton in the 2S state, it spends part of its time inside the proton (which is a constellation of elementary particles called quarks and gluons, with a lot of empty space). When the electron is inside the proton, the proton’s charge pulls the electron in opposing directions, partly canceling itself out. As a result, the amount of electrical attraction between the two decreases, reducing the energy that binds the atom together. The larger the proton, the more time the electron spends inside it, the less strongly bound the electron is, and the more easily it can hop away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By firing a laser into a cloud of hydrogen gas, Hessels and his team caused electrons to jump from the 2S state to the 2P state, where the electron never overlaps the proton. Pinpointing the energy required for the electron to make this jump revealed how weakly bound it was in the 2S state, when residing partly inside the proton. This directly revealed the proton’s size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pohl followed the same logic to deduce the proton radius from the Lamb shift of muonic hydrogen in 2010. But because muons are heavier, they huddle around protons more tightly in the 2S state than electrons do. This means they spend more time inside the proton, making the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen several million times more sensitive to the proton’s radius than it is in normal hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case, Hessels had to measure the energy difference between 2S and 2P to parts-per-million accuracy in order to deduce a precise value for the proton’s radius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new result implies that earlier attempts to measure the proton’s radius in electronic hydrogen tended to overshoot the true value. It’s unclear why this would be so. Some researchers may continue to improve and verify measurements of the proton’s size in order to put the puzzle to rest, but Hessels’ work is done. “We are dismantling our apparatus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that it is virtually impossible for an individual to day trade for a living, contrary to what course providers claim. We observe all individuals who began to day trade between 2013 and 2015 in the Brazilian equity futures market, the third in terms of volume in the world, and persisted for at least 300 days: 97% of them lost money, only 0.4% earned more than a bank teller (US$54 per day), and the top individual earned only US$310 per day with great risk (a standard deviation of US$2,560). Additionally, we find no evidence of learning by day trading.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hong Kong Exchanges Bids $39B to Take over London Stock Exchange</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lse-m-a-hong-kong-exchanges/hong-kong-exchanges-bids-39-billion-to-take-over-london-stock-exchange-idUSKCN1VW0YP</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lse-m-a-hong-kong-exchanges/hong-kong-exchanges-bids-39-billion-to-take-over-london-stock-exchange-idUSKCN1VW0YP</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_0388.HK_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/0388.HK&quot;&gt;0388.HK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) unveiled a $39 billion takeover approach to the London Stock Exchange Plc (LSE) (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_LSE.L_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/LSE.L&quot;&gt;LSE.L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) on Wednesday that received a cool response from investors concerned about its regulatory and financial hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevail, HKEX would have to persuade British politicians and European regulators to abandon their deep-rooted scepticism over mergers of financial exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also have to woo LSE shareholders who are in favor of maintaining their ownership following LSE’s $27 billion deal last month to acquire financial data provider Refinitiv. In an ominous sign for the deal’s prospects, LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday at a deep discount to HKEX’s offer price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its bid, HKEX is betting that a major international acquisition will help it overcome uncertainty at home. Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests in the last few weeks over China’s political influence have raised questions among major companies and investors about the appeal of the Hong Kong bourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX is also seeking to capitalize on the weakness of the British pound, which has been hit by Britain’s inability to settle on a deal to leave the European Union. The weaker pound has made British companies cheaper for foreign acquirers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal is aimed at creating a combined group better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_ICE.N_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/ICE.N&quot;&gt;ICE.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and CME Group inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_CME.O_3”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/CME.O&quot;&gt;CME.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). It is contingent on LSE abandoning the deal to acquire Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board of HKEX believes a proposed combination with LSE represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure leader,” the Hong Kong exchange said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LSE said it would review HKEX’s proposal. In a sign of its cool reception to HKEX’s bid, it added that it was committed to, and continued to, make good progress on its planned acquisition of Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_BX.N_4”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N&quot;&gt;BX.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and Thomson Reuters Corp (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_TRI.TO_5”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/TRI.TO&quot;&gt;TRI.TO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Refinitiv, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE once the deal has gone through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX, whose main shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said its 31.6 billion pounds cash-and-share transaction proposal represented a 22.9% premium to the LSE’s closing stock price on Tuesday of 8,361 pence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday only up 5.9% at 7,206 pence. The significant gap with HKEX’s offer price reflects widespread scepticism that the bid will succeed, investors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge: Securing the support of the British government, which has already signaled some wariness over handing control of its stock exchange to a foreign acquirer with close links to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Treasury described the LSE as a “critically important part” of the British financial system. “As you would expect, the government and the regulators will be looking at the (proposed deal) details closely,” a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks uncertain whether shareholders will accept the offer, given that the Refinitiv deal is popular across the shareholder base for its potential to transform the business and add value over the long-term,” said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter, a top-25 investor in the LSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong company acquiring one of Britain’s marquee financial institutions - which also owns the Milan exchange and is a major clearing house in the United States - would be a challenging feat for HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany’s Deutsche Boerse (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_DB1Gn.DE_6”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/DB1Gn.DE&quot;&gt;DB1Gn.DE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) has failed three times in recent years to acquire LSE, hitting opposition from politicians and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also not immediately clear whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, would also have jurisdiction to review HKEX’s bid for LSE, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the deal would be subject to CFIUS review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BLACKSTONE’S REFINITIV DEAL AT STAKE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinitiv’s deal with LSE came just 10 months after Blackstone bought a majority stake in the unit from Thomson Reuters in a $20 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSE has said it expects the Refinitiv acquisition to close in the second half of 2020. Were it to walk away, it would have to pay Refinitiv a 198.3 million pound break-up fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by the lukewarm reaction in LSE’s stock, Blackstone stayed put on Wednesday, viewing HKEX’s chances of success as remote, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of bonds issued by Refinitiv were only slightly lower in secondary trading on Wednesday, suggesting investors did not view the deal with LSE at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;HKEX FALLS BEHIND&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX has been the world’s largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years, going head-to-head against the New York Stock Exchange over that decade, according to Refinitiv data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year it has fallen behind, raising $10.8 billion to the NYSE’s $20.2 billion, with activity suffering as the political turmoil deepened. Last month, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_BABA.N_7”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/BABA.N&quot;&gt;BABA.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) delayed plans for a $15 billion offering in Hong Kong because of the unrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other bid for LSE appeared forthcoming on Wednesday. Benjamin Jackson, president of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, placed his company out of the running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reasons are, you have Brexit uncertainty, you’ve got valuations, you’ve got deals that have to meet our internal rate of return criteria that we put forth,” he said at a Barclays financial services conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy also poured cold water on the idea of a bid. “I just closed on my European transaction with NEX in November, and I’m laser focused on the integration of that and growing our core business,” Duffy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSE CEO David Schwimmer has said that big takeovers in exchanges are difficult due to political concerns. In recent years the LSE has sought to diversify away from basic trading and clearing to data and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asian exchange, however, said it was confident its proposal faced no major regulatory hurdles due to little overlap in markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX said it has already begun discussions with certain regulators in Britain and Hong Kong. “The board of HKEX believes that the two businesses are highly complementary and as such, looks forward to working with the relevant authorities to deliver a clear path to completion,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the proposed takeover be successful, it is expected that key LSE management would continue to operate LSE businesses, HKEX said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong government threw its support behind the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government is glad to see HKEX’s endeavor to enhance its core strength and seek international expansion in accordance with its strategic plan,” a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hackers Hit Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a ‘SIM Swap’</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — When hackers took over the Twitter account of Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, last week, they used an increasingly common and hard-to-stop technique that can give them complete access to a wide array of the most sensitive digital accounts, including social media, email and financial accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Called SIM swapping, it allows hackers to take control of a victim’s phone number. In recent months, SIM swapping has been used to hijack the online personas of politicians, celebrities and notables like Mr. Dorsey, to steal money all over the world and to simply harass regular people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Victims, no matter how prominent or technically sophisticated, have been unable to protect themselves, even after they have been hit again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’ve been looking at the criminal underground for a long time, and SIM swapping bothers me more than anything I’ve seen,” said Allison Nixon, the director of research at the security firm Flashpoint. “It requires no skill, and there is literally nothing the average person can do to stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6cb8eb2f&quot;&gt;How a SIM swap works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Criminals have learned how to persuade mobile phone providers like T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T to switch a phone number to a new device that is under their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The number is switched from a tiny plastic SIM card, or subscriber identity module, in the target’s phone to a SIM card in another device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sometimes hackers get phone numbers by calling a customer help line for a phone carrier and pretending to be the intended victim. In other recent incidents, hacking crews have paid off phone company employees to do the switches for them, often for as little as $100 for each phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Once the hackers have control of the phone number, they ask companies like Twitter and Google to send a temporary login code, via text message, to the victim’s phone. Most major online services are willing to send those messages to help users who have lost their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the temporary code is sent to the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Phone companies have been aware of the problem for years, but the only routine solution they have come up with is offering PIN codes that a phone owner must provide in order to switch devices. Even this measure has proved ineffective. Hackers can get the codes by bribing phone company employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It just doesn’t seem like the AT&amp;amp;Ts of the world are really doing anything to make it more difficult,” said Erin West, a deputy district attorney in California’s Santa Clara County and a member of a law enforcement task force focusing on the problem. “I live in fear that I will get SIM-swapped because it’s not that difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No American authorities are keeping statistics on the frequency of the attacks. But Ms. West and others who are tracking cases said they had become more frequent over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Account takeover fraud is an industrywide problem,” said Paula Jacinto, a spokeswoman for T-Mobile. “We use a number of safeguards to help protect against this crime and offer customers a variety of options to help them protect their own information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-488123ac&quot;&gt;Who has been hit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is difficult to ascertain how many mobile phone users have been hit by a SIM swap. But people around the world, from Kenya to Hollywood, have complained about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In recent weeks, the most prominent targets have been celebrities like Mr. Dorsey, the actress Jessica Alba, and online personalities like Shane Dawson and Amanda Cerny (her second time). The hackers used the accounts to post offensive messages to millions of followers. They also gained access to private communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Matthew Smith, who owns an internet-focused design studio in South Carolina, has been hit by SIM swappers four times — three times this year alone. Hackers had long wanted his Instagram handle, @whale. That made him a target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every time the attackers have gained access to his social media and email accounts, Mr. Smith’s phone provider, T-Mobile, has assured him that it has put additional measures in place to protect his account. While he has managed to get back his social media accounts, he has not regained access to two Google email accounts that held years of communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the most recent incidents this summer, after the attackers got into a new email address, they contacted Mr. Smith, his family and his friends to threaten him and his children with information from his accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It feels sickening,” Mr. Smith said. “It feels like everything you own, and you thought was safe and yours — that someone is playing with that like it is a toy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;T-Mobile said it would not comment on specific customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Victims have complained that after the attacks, they have struggled to get help from their phone companies, or to even get someone on the line at a phone company who understood the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the recording artist King Bach lost and then regained control of his phone number in late August, he posted an angry video on Twitter in which he said he had spent hours on the phone with AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The customer service is trash,” he said. “I couldn’t get no help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not respond to numerous requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-30fb9ec2&quot;&gt;Progressing from pranks to theft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SIM swapping became popular in the hacking community years ago. Attackers were mostly interested in taking control of rare or iconic social media account names, like a Twitter or Instagram account with just one name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But hackers soon realized they could gain access to more than social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2016, SIM-swapping gangs started targeting &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/business/dealbook/phone-hack-bitcoin-virtual-currency.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency holders&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike traditional bank transactions, once virtual currency is moved to a new address, the transaction cannot be reversed. American bank accounts have been less vulnerable to SIM swapping because banks will generally reverse any criminal transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over the last year, law enforcement officials have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/nine-individuals-connected-hacking-group-charged-online-identity-theft-and-other&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrested some of the gangs&lt;/a&gt; stealing cryptocurrency. For the first time, a hacker &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyaqnb/hacker-joel-ortiz-sim-swapping-10-years-in-prison&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;was sent to jail&lt;/a&gt; and is serving a 10-year sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The number of online crews focused on SIM swapping has been growing, researchers said, as has the range of victims and the type of accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Africa, gangs have used SIM swapping to target financial accounts tied to mobile phone providers, like the popular MPesa service in Kenya. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businesslive.co.za/money/2019-06-27-sim-swap-banking-fraud-surges-200/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South African officials said&lt;/a&gt; there were over 11,000 incidents there last year, triple that of the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Security experts have recommended that companies stop using phone numbers to help customers recover accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is a technology problem because we are using a very old technology that is not designed to be secure to send secure codes,” said Fabio Assolini, a security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, who lost his own phone number in a SIM-swapping attack last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Twitter said on Wednesday that it would stop allowing some users to post updates via text message, which made Twitter access particularly easy for SIM swappers. But that will not stop hackers who use the SIM swap to log in to a victim’s Twitter account. (Twitter said it was working to improve this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Security experts are worried that hackers could step up their attacks and use the method to go after even higher-value targets. The phones and social media applications of several Brazilian politicians have recently been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“SIM swapping is proliferating, and it is going to keep proliferating until companies deal with this,” Ms. Nixon said. “This is a known issue at this point. There is not really any excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;“All good things come in threes” is what the Dutch social enterprise must have thought when they were planning the Fairphone 3, their newest ethically-made mobile device, sporting a modular and repairable design. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fairphone+2+Teardown/52523&quot;&gt;Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 already set the bar high for smartphone repairability—only a teardown will tell if its successor can raise that bar further, as other big manufacturers continue to offer phones that are glued shut and increasingly hard to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ifixit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iFixit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/ifixit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://createsend.ifixit.com/h/r/0CB34AA2381CF97A&quot;&gt;tried-and-true newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date with the latest news in the repair world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Malaria breakthrough as scientists find ‘highly effective’ way to kill parasite</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/05/malaria-breakthrough-as-scientists-find-highly-effective-way-to-kill-parasite</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/05/malaria-breakthrough-as-scientists-find-highly-effective-way-to-kill-parasite</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Human trials of new antimalarial drugs are in the pipeline after Kenyan scientists successfully used bacteria to kill the parasite that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and global health partners say the breakthrough could potentially lead to the development of a new class of drugs in less than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of a new treatment comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32321-3/fulltext&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32321-3/fulltext&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;in Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt; proved that Ivermectin, a conventional drug used for parasitic diseases including river blindness and elephantiasis, reduced transmission rates. The medication worked by making the blood of people who were repeatedly vaccinated &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/19657/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;lethal to mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that Ivermectin can kill &lt;em&gt;plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt;, the malaria parasite carried by female mosquitoes, when administered to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;A mosquito&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23493696e9ac68066414d1131901f76e445cd83/0_6_650_390/master/650.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=4f0e3c31037dcb6b638449b6c71440a2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now perform human trials using new drugs derived from the bacteria after extensive lab research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative was prompted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications-detail/strategic-advisory-group-malaria-eradication-executive-summary&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the World Health Organization and several international health agencies warning of resistance to existing antimalarial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Resistance is always a problem and the parasite always finds a way to get away with it. That is why a new line of treatment is a must. It has to be made available soon,” said Dr Simon Kariuki, head of Kenya’s malaria research programmes at Kemri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is being conducted in Kenya by local scientists in collaboration with international health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have discovered [that the] bacterium is highly effective in killing &lt;em&gt;plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt;, the parasite that causes malaria, but our research is more focused on pregnant women and children as they are more vulnerable. We are getting very motivating leads,” Kariuki said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a few years, new malaria drugs could be in the market if the current research findings are to go by. The same bacteria known to kill dangerous pathogens in scabies, river blindness, can also be applied in malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The motivating success of Ivermectin is leading us to venture into producing other drugs. That is very encouraging and it means more research, and that is what we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Mosquitoes are seen on a net at a research facility in Nairobi, Kenya&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d55b918890e0d0d619bfe1c1233477bea97cde8/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ac5bf1875d976a2d01c90632e7765ef0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child malaria episodes could be reduced by up to 20% if populations living in high-risk areas are given Ivermectin, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/19657/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;study published&lt;/a&gt; by the Yale School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s health ministry says malaria cases have gone up from 16,000 in 2016 to about 18,757 last year, and experts warn that the climate crisis could make matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future drug trials of women and children are planned … and obviously with the highest safety standards. We need more answers on Ivermectin. We need new malaria drugs as soon as possible as drug resistance is not something to ignore and we have to treat the situation as urgent,” said Kariuki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;'Malaria will not be eradicated in near future', warns WHO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert, independent from the study, said reports of resistance to the current class of malaria drugs are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There have been confirmed reports by the World &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/health&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization that there have been cases of resistance in Thailand and Cambodia, and closer to home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” said Dr Evans Murage, a pharmacist based in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are cases of the drugs being sold over the counter, leading to their resistance and overuse. Many people who buy drugs from pharmacies suspect they have malaria even without getting tested. This should be a worry for the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most effective vaccine to have a protective effect against malaria is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.malariavaccine.org/malaria-and-vaccines/rtss&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;RTS,S&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in a WHO-recommended pilot scheme in 2019. In trials it was found to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;prevent approximately 39%&lt;/a&gt; of cases of malaria in children aged from five to 17 months.&lt;/p&gt;
