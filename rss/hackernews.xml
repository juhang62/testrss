<description>&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Posted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkcoding.net/category/software/&quot; rel=&quot;category tag&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt; at 18:54 by graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a professional software engineer and enthusiastic pro-am systems administrator, I have long been curious about DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the last two days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-portland/welcome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;PDX DevOpsDays&lt;/a&gt;. Across organised talks, Ignite’s, Open Spaces, and as many hallway conversations as I could fit in, here is what I learned about what “DevOps” is and does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps is Ops with new tools&lt;/strong&gt;. I went to DevOpsDays thinking DevOps means developers and operations merged into one team. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not meet or hear from any developers. It was a gathering of system administrators who use version control, and write a lot of YAML. Programming languages were not a topic; I heard Python mentioned once in passing, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps means the veteran admins had to check in their personal scripts, and everyone is expected to automate more things. They relate to the software their business runs (“app”, “asset”) the way a merchant-navy captain relates to what’s in the containers on his ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2492&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AWS is king&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever a hosting provider was mentioned, it was AWS. It was usually mentioned as if it was a basic understanding that we’re both on AWS. Google Cloud was a sponsor but didn’t otherwise get mentioned, Digital Ocean was mentioned once, and one of my lunch tables had someone who uses Azure. Otherwise it was all AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack is king&lt;/strong&gt;. “Chatops” is big. Being a gathering of system administrators I’d expected more IRC, there was no mention of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone hates YAML&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone writes a lot of YAML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-call / incident-response is a big&lt;/strong&gt; part of the DevOps job, and several of the sessions focused solely on that. As a result they also talk about mental health more than programmers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud monitoring is a saturated market&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe half the vendors/sponsors were cloud monitoring (i.e. Prometheus competitors), although most of them called it something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible and Packer&lt;/strong&gt; were the tools I heard mentioned the most, in that order. Prometheus was popular for monitoring, but many (most?) used a vendor, such as Datadog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common job title seemed to be &lt;strong&gt;SRE&lt;/strong&gt; (Site Reliability Engineer), although there was a long tail, and they don’t care much about job titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many were curious about &lt;strong&gt;service-meshes&lt;/strong&gt; (basically a smart network proxy?) such as Istio or Linkerd, but almost none were using one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus on how &lt;strong&gt;software releases&lt;/strong&gt; happen is that your CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the “asset” resulting in a Docker container, which is they deployed in a blue-green fashion using either Kubernetes or Terraform. The existence of a CI/CD pipeline that produces a Docker container was assumed in most conversations I had. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone loves containers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDX DevOpsDays was one of the best run conferences I’ve been to (MC &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Alice Goldfuss&lt;/a&gt; was phenomenal), and probably the one I learnt the most at. A++++ would conference again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, when new iOS jailbreaks become public, the event is bittersweet. The exploit allowing people to bypass restrictions Apple puts into the mobile operating system allows hobbyists and researchers to customize their devices and gain valuable insights that may be peeking under the covers. That benefit is countered by the threat that the same jailbreak will give hackers a new way to install malware or unlock iPhones that are lost, stolen, or confiscated by unscrupulous authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

Friday saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/unpatchable-bug-in-millions-of-ios-devices-exploited-developer-claims/&quot;&gt;release of Checkm8&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike just about every jailbreak exploit released in the past nine years, it targets the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Bootrom&quot;&gt;iOS bootrom&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the very first code that's executed when an iDevice is turned on. Because the bootrom is contained in read-only memory inside a chip, jailbreak vulnerabilities that reside there can't be patched.
&lt;p&gt;Checkm8 was developed by a hacker who uses the handle &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/axi0mX&quot;&gt;axi0mX&lt;/a&gt;. He's the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axi0mX/alloc8&quot;&gt;another jailbreak-enabling exploit called alloc8&lt;/a&gt; that was released in 2017. Because it was the first known iOS bootrom exploit in seven years, it was of intense interest to researchers, but it worked only on the iPhone 3GS, which was seven years old by the time alloc8 went public. The limitation gave the exploit little practical application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkm8 is different. It works on 11 generations of iPhones, from the 4S to the X. While it doesn't work on newer devices, Checkm8 can jailbreak hundreds of millions of devices in use today. And because the bootrom can't be updated after the device is manufactured, Checkm8 will be able to jailbreak in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn how Checkm8 will shape the iPhone experience—particularly as it relates to security—so I spoke at length with axi0mX on Friday. Thomas Reed, director of Mac offerings at security firm Malwarebytes, joined me. The takeaways from the long-ranging interview are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checkm8 requires physical access to the phone. It can't be remotely executed, even if combined with other exploits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exploit allows only tethered jailbreaks, meaning it lacks persistence. The exploit must be run each time an iDevice boots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkm8 doesn't bypass the protections offered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple%E2%80%99s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-important&quot;&gt;Secure Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID&quot;&gt;Touch ID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the above means people will be able to use Checkm8 to install malware only under very limited circumstances. The above also means that Checkm8 is unlikely to make it easier for people who find, steal or confiscate a vulnerable iPhone, but don't have the unlock PIN, to access the data stored on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkm8 is going to benefit researchers, hobbyists, and hackers by providing a way not seen in almost a decade to access the lowest levels of iDevices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out, in axi0mX's own words, why he believes this is the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Goodin:&lt;/strong&gt; Can we start with the broad details? Can you describe at a high level what Checkm8 is, or what it is not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;axi0mX:&lt;/strong&gt; It is an exploit, and that means it can get around the protection that Apple built into the bootrom of most recent iPhones and iPads. It can compromise it so that you can execute any code at the bootrom level that you want. That is something that used to be common years ago, during the days of the first iPhone and iPhone 3G and iPhone 4. There were bootrom exploits [then] so that people could jailbreak their phone through the bootrom and that later would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last bootrom exploit that was released was for iPhone 4 back in 2010, I believe by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tag/george-hotz/&quot;&gt;Geohot&lt;/a&gt;. After that, it was not possible to exploit an iPhone at this level. All the jailbreaks [that] were done later on [happened] once the operating system boots. The reason that bootrom is special is it's part of the chip that Apple made for the phone. So whatever code is put there in the factory is going to be there for the rest of its life. So if there is any vulnerability inside the bootrom, it cannot be patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Persistence and Secure Enclave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DG:&lt;/strong&gt; When we talk about things that aren't patchable, we're talking about the bug. What about the change to the device itself? Is that permanent, or once the phone is rebooted, does it go back to its original state?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This exploit works only in memory, so it doesn't have anything that persists after reboot. Once you reboot the phone... then your phone is back to an unexploited state. That doesn't mean that you can't do other things because you have full control of the device that would modify things. But the exploit itself does not actually perform any changes. It's all until you reboot the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DG:&lt;/strong&gt; In a scenario where either police or a thief obtains a vulnerable phone but doesn't have an unlock PIN, are they going to be helped in any way by this exploit? Does this exploit allow them to access parts of this phone or do things with this phone that they couldn't otherwise do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The answer is &quot;It depends.&quot; Before Apple introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple%E2%80%99s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-important&quot;&gt;Secure Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID&quot;&gt;Touch ID&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, you didn't have advanced security protections. So, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/fbi-paid-at-least-1-3m-for-zero-day-to-get-into-san-bernardino-iphone/&quot;&gt;[San Bernardino gun man's] phone that was famously unlocked [by the FBI]&lt;/a&gt;—the iPhone 5c— that didn't have Secure Enclave. So in that case, this vulnerability would allow you to very quickly get the PIN and get access to all the data. But for pretty much all current phones, from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8, there is a Secure Enclave that protects your data if you don't have the PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My exploit does not affect the Secure Enclave at all. It only allows you to get code execution on the device. It doesn't help you boot towards the PIN because that is protected by a separate system. But for older devices, which have been deprecated for a while now, for those devices like the iPhone 5, there is not a separate system, so in that case you could be able to [access data] quickly [without an unlock PIN].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DG:&lt;/strong&gt; So this exploit isn't going to be of much benefit to a person who has that device [with Secure Enclave] but does not have the PIN, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; If by benefit you mean accessing your data, then yes, that is correct. But it's still possible they might have other goals than accessing your data, and in that case, it's possible they would get some benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DG:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you talking about creating some sort of backdoor that once the owner puts in a PIN it would get sent to the attacker, or a scenario like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; If, say, for example, you leave your phone in a hotel room, it's possible that someone did something to your phone that causes it to send all of the information to some bad actor's computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DG:&lt;/strong&gt; And that would happen after the legitimate owner returned and entered their PIN?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, but that's not really a scenario that I would worry much about, because attackers at that level… would be more likely to get you to go to a bad webpage or connect to a bad Wi-Fi hotspot in a remote exploit scenario. Attackers don't like to be close. They want to be in the distance and hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case [involving Checkm8], they would have to physically hold your device in their hand and would have to connect a cable to it. It requires access that most attackers would like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google will stop showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, complying with a new European copyright law, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change means French users will only see the headlines and not the first few lines or a thumbnail image for news content unless European publishers specifically request to show previews, the company said. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2l7a3YO&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2l7a3YO&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of European publishers are expected to be affected by the changes, but French publishers will be the most hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move may impact publishers’ revenue stream as visibility on Google drives traffic to their websites, potentially boosting advertising and subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain and Germany in recent years tried to force Google to pay publishers for taking snippets of their news articles, but that backfired after Google News pulled out from Spain and traffic of German publisher Axel Springer plunged after it sought to block the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France is the only EU country so far to implement the bloc’s far-reaching copyright reforms, which were adopted earlier this year. The countries have a year or so to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Science’s pirate queen</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;eheJSl&quot;&gt;In cramped quarters at Russia’s Higher School of Economics, shared by four students and a cat, sat a server with 13 hard drives. The server hosted Sci-Hub, a website with over 64 million academic papers available for free to anybody in the world. It was the reason that, one day in June 2015, Alexandra Elbakyan, the student and programmer with a futurist streak and a love for neuroscience blogs, opened her email to a message from the world’s largest publisher: “YOU HAVE BEEN SUED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aNJ2YM&quot;&gt;It wasn’t long before an administrator at Library Genesis, another pirate repository named in the lawsuit, emailed her about the announcement. “I remember when the administrator at LibGen sent me this news and said something like ‘Well, that’s... that’s a real problem.’ There’s no literal translation,” Elbakyan tells me in Russian. “It’s basically ‘That’s an ass.’ But it doesn’t translate perfectly into English. It’s more like ‘That’s fucked up. We’re fucked.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;33KXsM&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sci-Hub posed a direct threat to the academic publishers’ business model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Bz14Fy&quot;&gt;The publisher Elsevier owns over 2,500 journals covering every conceivable facet of scientific inquiry to its name, and it wasn’t happy about either of the sites. Elsevier charges readers an average of $31.50 per paper for access; Sci-Hub and LibGen offered them for free. But even after receiving the “YOU HAVE BEEN SUED” email, Elbakyan was surprisingly relaxed. She went back to work. She was in Kazakhstan. The lawsuit was in America. She had more pressing matters to attend to, like filing assignments for her religious studies program; writing acerbic blog-style posts on the Russian clone of Facebook, called vKontakte; participating in various feminist groups online; and attempting to launch a sciencey-print T-shirt business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Io77cm&quot;&gt;That 2015 lawsuit would, however, place a spotlight on Elbakyan and her homegrown operation. The publicity made Sci-Hub bigger, transforming it into the largest Open Access academic resource in the world. In just six years of existence, Sci-Hub had become a juggernaut: the 64.5 million papers it hosted represented two-thirds of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; published research, and it was available to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H6oYX9&quot;&gt;But as Sci-Hub grew in popularity, academic publishers grew alarmed. Sci-Hub posed a direct threat to their business model. They began to pursue pirates aggressively, putting pressure on internet service providers (ISPs) to combat piracy. They had also taken to battling advocates of Open Access, a movement that advocates for free, universal access to research papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5hTVHT&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub provided press, academics, activists, and even publishers with an excuse to talk about who owns academic research online. But that conversation — at least in English — took place largely without Elbakyan, the person who started Sci-Hub in the first place. Headlines reduced her to a female Aaron Swartz, ignoring the significant differences between the two. Now, even though Elbakyan stands at the center of an argument about how copyright is enforced on the internet, most people have no idea who she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;5eWv5A&quot;&gt;“The first time I encountered the distribution of scientific articles and sharing, it was in 2009,” Elbakyan says. As a student doing research at the Russian Academy of Sciences, she ran across an obstacle encountered by students the world over: paywalls. Most science journals charge money to access their articles. And the prices have only been rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NiCQOO&quot;&gt;How much? Exact estimates are hard to come by. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/alpsp/lp/2013/00000026/00000003/art00009&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) suggests that the cost of libraries’ subscriptions to journals only increased by 9 percent between 1990 and 2013. But as &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s annual survey pointed out, there was a change in ARL’s data collection. That estimate, &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; said, “flies in the face of reality.” &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s records showed that a year’s subscription to a chemistry journal in the US ran, on average, for $4,773; the cheapest subscriptions were to general science journals, which only cost $1,556 per year. Those prices make these journals inaccessible to most people without institutional access — and they’re increasingly difficult for institutions to finance as well. “Those who [have] been involved with purchasing serials in the last 20 years know that serial prices represent the largest inflationary factor for library budgets,” the &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Tt3Dt2&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over half of all research is now published by the big five of academic publishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jJaMjF&quot;&gt;Taken together, universities’ subscriptions to academic journals often cost $500,000 to $2 million. Even Harvard &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/harvard-journal-subscription-fees-are-prohibitive-6659&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 that it couldn’t afford journals’ rising fees, citing, in particular, two publishers that had inflated their rates by 145 percent within six years. Germany’s University of Konstanz dropped its subscription to Elsevier’s journals in 2014, saying its prices had increased by 30 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/03/german-university-tells-elsevier-no-deal&quot;&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; in five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sFuHeW&quot;&gt;The prices rise because a few top players have positioned themselves with the power to ratchet them up with impunity. Over half of all research, according to one &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502#pone.0127502.ref047&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, is now published by the big five of academic publishing: Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, Taylor &amp;amp; Francis, and, depending on the metric, either the American Chemical Society or Sage Publishing. That’s a significant change from 1973, when only 20 percent of these kinds of papers were published by the big five. And that’s just for natural and medical science papers; the social sciences have it worse. In 1973, only one in 10 articles debuted in the big five’s pages; now it’s more than half. For some fields, such as psychology, 71 percent of all papers now go through these players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;y6Mojq&quot;&gt;Profits and market caps for the publishers have also swelled. Elsevier’s parent comapny RELX Group, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REL.L/key-statistics?p=REL.L&quot;&gt;boasts&lt;/a&gt; a nearly $35 billion market cap. It has reported a nearly 39 &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502#pone.0127502.ref047&quot;&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; profit margin for its scientific publishing arm — which dwarfs, by comparison, the margins of tech titans such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/gross_profit_margin&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ycharts.com/companies/GOOG/profit_margin&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/profit_margin&quot;&gt;Ama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works&quot;&gt;zon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hPuLFM&quot;&gt;If you’re looking to access an article behind a paywall, the only way to get it legally is to pay, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/psuber&quot;&gt;Peter Suber&lt;/a&gt;, director of Harvard’s Open Access Project. But there is a gray area: you can ask an author for a copy. (Most academics will oblige.) Aside from either that or finding articles published in free Open Access journals, the next best option is to find pre-publication copies of papers that authors have put in open-access repositories like Cornell’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;Arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QdNQPZ&quot;&gt;Suber is one of the loudest voices for Open Access movement. He was one of the original architects of the 2002 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Open_Access_Initiative&quot;&gt;Budapest Open Access Initiative&lt;/a&gt; statement that established the most widely used definition of Open Access: “free availability on the public internet,” with the only constraint on sharing of research being authors’ “control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.” It also established the movement’s mandate to make Open Access the default method of publishing within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;4BBUrD&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;When Elbakyan found herself facing paywall after paywall, she began to wonder why she shouldn’t just jump them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kt51zj&quot;&gt;That hasn’t happened yet, but the movement has inspired people to create thousands of Open Access journals including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt; (the Public Library of Sciences). The movement has also pushed many publishers to allow scientists to upload their research to Open Access repositories like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv&quot;&gt;Arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; — which are currently the largest legal source of Open Access papers. The movement has been so successful that even the government has shown signs of supporting it. For instance, in 2013, the Obama administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research&quot;&gt;mandated&lt;/a&gt; that copies of research conducted through federal agencies must be uploaded to free repositories within 12 months of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;va9nnM&quot;&gt;Many students like Elbakyan simply email studies’ authors, or tweet the article’s information with the hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICanHazPDF&quot;&gt;#ICanHazPDF&lt;/a&gt; hoping someone will send them a copy if they’re blocked by a paywall. But these methods, like scouring Arxiv, tend to be hit-or-miss. So when Elbakyan found herself facing paywall after paywall, she began to wonder why she shouldn’t just jump them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hMJmS8&quot;&gt;Elbakyan had been following the Open Access movement and was an ardent fan of MIT’s OpenCourseWare — an initiative through which the university makes virtually all of its coursework available — since 2008. She’d also always been fascinated with neuroscience, especially the articles by the neurologist-turned-writer (and longtime head of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian’s&lt;/em&gt; Neurophilosophy blog) Mo Costandi. Elbakyan became convinced that untapped potential was hidden in the human brain. She particularly liked the idea of the “global brain,” a neuroscience-inspired idea by futurists that an intelligent network could facilitate information storage and transfer — driving communication between people in real time, the way that neurons that fire together wire together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;520DRd&quot;&gt;“I started thinking about the idea of a brain-machine interface that can connect minds in the same way computer network does,” Elbakyan says. If a human’s mind could be connected to a bird’s, she wondered, could we truly experience what it felt like soar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;g4dOs5&quot;&gt;At first, these were just philosophical musings. However, Elbakyan was compelled by how neural interfaces could enable people to share information, even across language barriers, with unprecedented speed. “Later, I expanded the idea to include not only hard interfaces that would connect people directly neuron-by-neuron, but also soft interfaces, such as speech, that we use every day to communicate.” She cared less about the form than the function: she wanted a global brain. To her, paywalls began to seem like the plaques in an Alzheimer’s-riddled mind, clogging up the flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WsCCpm&quot;&gt;Her inspirations also took a slightly more nationalistic bent. Elbakyan studied the writings of Russian neurofuturist thinkers like Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky. In 2011, she attempted to create a Russian-language PLOS-style Open Access journal. (She failed to find enough scientists who were interested.) Later that year, Elbakyan even applied to the Skolkovo Innovation Center, Russia’s self-styled answer to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jgzhur&quot;&gt;Political theory provided new growth to her evolving Open Access philosophy. Communism, a model of government-less society in which resources and opportunity are metered out with equality and impartiality, has never been successfully implemented. Nevertheless, it was a particularly seductive concept to Elbakyan. The collective ideals of communism entwined for her with the ideals of the scientific method. After all, science depends on shared data. History’s greatest scientific discoveries have all been made and shared, as scientists often say, from atop the shoulders of giants: their scientific predecessors who shared their research. To Elbakyan, science thrives only when scientists &lt;em&gt;shout&lt;/em&gt; their discoveries to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YsxRzV&quot;&gt;According to Elbakyan, communism and science share a common mission, which she refers to as “scientific communism.” It’s a concept she came to borrow from the 20th century American sociologist Robert Merton, who founded the sociology of science, a study of science as a social practice. (Merton coined influential terms such as “self-fulfilling prophecy,” “role model,” and “unintended consequences.”) Most influential to Elbakyan were Merton’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms&quot;&gt;norms&lt;/a&gt;,” which were what he considered to be the defining characteristics of science: universalism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism, and, of course, communism. (Throughout our interview, she’s still quick to rattle off quotes from Merton, declaring, “The communism of the scientific ethos is incompatible with the definition of technology as ‘private property’ in a capitalistic economy.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;END6i4&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;According to Elbakyan, communism and science share a common mission&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ESus1H&quot;&gt;Elbakyan’s scientific communism mirrors the Western association between democracy and information openness. (Take the commonly used American expression “the democratization of… ”) Her intellectual convictions informed the growing vehemence with which Elbakyan insisted that absolutely unfettered access was the only acceptable level of access the public should have to discoveries. Ultimately, she concluded that in an age where scientists can publish their research “directly on the internet,” or through paywall-free Open Access journals, traditional publishers will inevitably fade into obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iipfwb&quot;&gt;To Open Access activists like Elbakyan and Suber, since most research is publicly funded, paywall journals have essentially made most science a twice-paid product, bought first by taxpayers and secondly by scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sQKo3c&quot;&gt;On the whole, scientific publishing has become a market increasingly characterized by consolidation, soaring subscription fees, and rising profit margins. As a result, plenty of scientists, students, and journalists alike have come to see an empire of academic piracy as a necessity, raising the question: what value do publishers add to any given paper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f5hYzd&quot;&gt;Richard Van Noorden probed this very question in a 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fopen-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that looked at the meteoric rise of Open Access journals. These journals had an unassuming start in the late 1980s and ‘90s with a handful of obscure digital publications. Many of these were the result of scientists, entrepreneurs, and editors from paywall publications who were inspired by the Open Access movement and struck out to start their own publications. Within just a few decades, these journals have come to account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/preprints/3119/&quot;&gt;28 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all published research that’s ever been issued a Digital Object Identifier — essentially a type of URL for research. As the article pointed out, many Open Access publishers charge scientists fees — often anywhere from a few hundred dollars up to around two thousand — for processing their articles, whether they’re accepted or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;91sR70&quot;&gt;Standard publishers, by contrast, generally charge much less if they require processing fees at all. In return, they find peer reviewers, check for plagiarism, edit, typeset, commonly add graphics, convert files into standard formats such as XML, and add metadata. They distribute print and digital copies of research. Their press departments, especially for more prestigious journals, are well-oiled machines. They churn out perspicuous press releases and help journalists get in touch with experts, enforcing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.ejo.ch/research/research-journalists-still-observe-news-embargoes&quot;&gt;embargo&lt;/a&gt; periods where media outlets can review research and formulate their coverage before it goes live — which creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2006/08/21/embargo-should-go&quot;&gt;incentives&lt;/a&gt; for publications like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to cover more of their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UEhbLA&quot;&gt;Many publishers also do original journalism and commentary, thanks to the work of large, costly full-time staffs of editors, graphic designers, and technical experts. “But not every publisher ticks all the boxes on this list, puts in the same effort or hires costly professional staff,” wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fopen-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676%23auth-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Van Noorden&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article. “For example, most of PLoS ONE’s editors are working scientists, and the journal does not perform functions such as copy-editing.” Publishing powerhouses like &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; have estimated its internal cost per-article to be around $3,700. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, says that each article sets it back around $30,000 to $40,000 — an unreasonable amount to expect scientists to pay if they were to go Open Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rbwDeD&quot;&gt;Charging a fee isn’t the only business model for Open Access journals, Suber says: 70 &lt;a href=&quot;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_by_the_numbers&quot;&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; of peer-review Open Access models don’t do it. Moreover, thanks in large part to pressure by Open Access activists like Suber, many journals allow scientists to deposit a copy of their work in repositories like Arxiv. Elbakyan, on the other hand, wants Open Access fees covered up front in research grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id=&quot;XmUp4n&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elbakyan argues Sci-Hub is a tool of necessity, and its massive usership in poor countries seems to strengthen her case&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xUF9ug&quot;&gt;This question of what value publishers add was front and center in coverage on Elsevier and Elbakyan’s case. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/opinion/sunday/should-all-research-papers-be-free.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, “Should All Research Papers Be Free?” When &lt;em&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/em&gt; worked with Elbakyan to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; Sci-Hub’s user statistics, it discovered that a quarter of Sci-Hub downloads were from the 34 richest countries on Earth. Elbakyan argues Sci-Hub is a tool of necessity, and its massive usership in poor countries seems to strengthen her case. But the 25 percent of users from wealthy countries suggests Sci-Hub is a tool of convenience, says James Milne, a spokesman for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/&quot;&gt;Coalition for Responsible Sharing&lt;/a&gt;, a consortium that represents the interests of big publishers. (When I contacted Elsevier for comment on this story, I was referred to Milne.) The CRS was originally formed by a coterie of five publishing giants — Elsevier, ACS, Brill, Wiley, and Wolters Kluwer — to pressure scientist social networking site Researchgate into taking down 7 million unauthorized copies of their papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Tpbf6o&quot;&gt;Before Elbakyan was a pirate, she was an aspiring scientist with a knack for philosophizing and computer programming. “I started programming before even being in school,” Elbakyan says. Once enrolled, she developed a program that would ultimately serve as a precursor for Sci-Hub: a script that circumvented paywalls, using MIT’s subscription programs to download neuroscience books. “It wasn’t working exactly the same as Sci-Hub, but it was delivering the same result: going around paywalls and downloading those books.” She often shared these books with other users on a Russian biology forum she frequented, molbiol.ru, which would prove to lay the groundwork for Sci-Hub’s debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O0wsGi&quot;&gt;“Sci-Hub started as an automation for what I was already doing manually,” Elbakyan says. It grew organically from her desire to let people download papers “at the click of a button.” Users loved it. Sci-Hub’s use proliferated across the forum immediately — though it took longer for it to outgrow the forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RBId1e&quot;&gt;Russia’s weak intellectual property protection had long made it one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/trade-copyright-countries/brics-score-lowest-on-intellectual-property-protection-index-idUSL1E8NA77920121211&quot;&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; piracy hubs among major economies. This was an advantage for Elbakyan in creating Sci-Hub, but she soon found herself watching Russia and Kazakhstan’s dialogue on piracy shift. For years, the focus had been entertainment, but now it was rapidly pivoting toward academic piracy. New anti-piracy laws, which targeted what Elbakyan saw as essential information sharing, hit home for her: in Kazakhstan, illicit file-sharing had just become punishable by up to five years in prison. She felt that the only responsible choice was to join the fray herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3HEA1x&quot;&gt;When Elbakyan started Sci-Hub in 2011, “it was a side project,” she says. She operated it without a repository for downloaded articles. With every request for a paper, a new copy was downloaded through a university’s subscription. It would automatically be deleted six hours later. If, for some reason, a person couldn’t access a paper through one university’s servers, they could switch and download them through another’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jr6xOH&quot;&gt;In 2012, she struck a partnership with LibGen, which had only archived books until then. LibGen asked Elbakyan to upload the articles Sci-Hub was downloading. Then, in 2013, when Sci-Hub’s popularity began to explode in China, she started using LibGen as an offsite repository. Instead of downloading and deleting new copies of papers or buying expensive hard drives, she retooled Sci-Hub to check if LibGen had a copy of a user’s requested paper first. If so, she pulled it from its archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;88n1yf&quot;&gt;That worked well until the domain LibGen.org, went down, deleting 40,000 papers Elbakyan had collected, probably because one of its administrators &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/2raea8/libgen_down/&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; of cancer. “One of my friends suggested to start actively collecting donations on Sci-Hub,” she says. “I started a crowdfunding campaign on Sci-Hub to buy additional drives, and soon had my own copy of the database collected by LibGen, around 21 million papers. Around 1 million of these papers [were] uploaded from Sci-Hub. The other[s], as I was told, came from databases that were downloaded on the darknet.” From then on, LibGen’s database would simply be her backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t0BqMa&quot;&gt;Elbakyan is reluctant to disclose much about how she secured access to so many papers, but she tells me that most of it came from exploiting libraries and universities’ subscriptions, saying that she “gained access” to “around 400 universities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;052nuh&quot;&gt;It’s likely that many of the credentials Elbakyan secured came from leaked login information and lapses in universities’ security. One official at Marquette University, &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpow.com/2016/02/25/does-sci-hub-phish-for-credentials/&quot;&gt;alleges&lt;/a&gt; to have seen evidence of Sci-Hub phishing for credentials. Elbakyan vociferously &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/05/31/why-sci-hub-matters/&quot;&gt;denies&lt;/a&gt; this and has previously said that many academics have even offered their login information. That could explain how Sci-Hub downloads some papers “directly from publishers,” as she has previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/some-facts-on-sci-hub-that-wikipedia-gets-wrong/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Haks0T&quot;&gt;It wasn’t until 2013 that Elbakyan faced her first major obstacle. That was when Elsevier sent a notice to PayPal, where she’d collected donations. At the time, according to testimony the publisher later gave in its lawsuit, Elsevier was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/Elsevier_v_Sci-Hub/2015-06-11*/DECLARATION%20of%20Anthony%20Woltermann/Elsevier_Inc_et_al_v_Sci-Hub_et_al__nysdce-15-04282__0008.0.pdf&quot;&gt;aware&lt;/a&gt; that Sci-Hub had paid some students for access to their university credentials. And several PayPal payments had been sent to Elbakyan for buying a proxy server that would allow Sci-Hub to authenticate itself as a student. After the publisher’s notice, PayPal deactivated her account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SGZBwc&quot;&gt;When Elsevier’s first shot across Elbakyan’s bow splashed down, the publisher already had gotten serious about pressuring internet service providers and payment services to enforce privacy. But it wasn’t the first time the publisher had pulled these strong-arm tactics. In fact, Elsevier was leading the way among academic publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iFJ5Tf&quot;&gt;In 2008, Elsevier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-and-thieme-publishers-secure-victory-against-international-digital-pirates&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; an international piracy operation wherein a Vietnamese entrepreneur was selling digital copies of journals to academics. The publisher, both on its own, and through at least one industry group, the American Association of Publishers, pushed Congress for laws that that would have made it easier for publishers to more easily coerce ISPs, search engines, and DNS services to block access to a site — or force advertisers and payment services to drop their support for copyright violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;5QRq0T&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elsevier was leading the way among publishers with its strong-arm tactics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NzGNPu&quot;&gt;From publishers’ perspective, it only made sense. Increasing their own power to enforce copyright claims was protecting their intellectual property. And though the bills sparked intense backlash for many companies that supported them, individual academic publishers like Elsevier were overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IARbld&quot;&gt;That same year, the AAP and Elsevier also supported and &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=835b4a27-ecc8-4543-82cc-4de778f4c2cb&amp;amp;filingTypeID=51&quot;&gt;lobbied&lt;/a&gt; in favor of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3699&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; that would have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/the-research-works-act-asking-the-public-to-pay-twice-for-scientific-knowledge/&quot;&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; the government from requiring agencies to make research published through a journal Open Access at any point. That would have effectively killed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-05-022.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; mandate that all research funded by the agency have a copy submitted to an Open Access repository within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fCVh48&quot;&gt;Later that year, the publisher’s rising prices and support for restrictive legislation galvanized nearly 17,000 scientists to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecostofknowledge.com/&quot;&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; against publishing in its journals. Facing backlash, Elsevier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/message-on-the-research-works-act&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; its position. Despite its meteoric rise, the boycott ultimately faded with little concrete effect on the publishing giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eJusft&quot;&gt;Elsevier’s efforts weren’t limited to lobbying for more-restrictive laws, either. Months before targeting Elbakyan, Elsevier helped 17 other publishers &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/book-publishers-shut-down-library-nu-and-ifile-it-120215/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the pirate academic repository Library.nu. Between 2012 and 2013, Elsevier and the AAP also opposed and lobbied against three bills — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparcopen.org/our-work/frpaa/%5C&quot;&gt;Federal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=c1cc4dc6-da6d-40b4-aa56-a4f39d794593&amp;amp;filingTypeID=78&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=835b4a27-ecc8-4543-82cc-4de778f4c2cb&amp;amp;filingTypeID=51&quot;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=956adad7-c9b1-4d3e-867d-84aea237199d&amp;amp;filingTypeID=60&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=a0491e38-ea85-49fc-8b2e-596c25a17a7f&amp;amp;filingTypeID=69&quot;&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1426/text&quot;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=65C229C2-60F4-4DB5-84E8-F9635A51B551&amp;amp;filingTypeID=69&quot;&gt;Access to Public Science Act&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FASTRfactsheet2015.pdf&quot;&gt;Fair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Notes_on_the_Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=06CCF218-DA5B-42AC-BFA2-78BCC454B21E&amp;amp;filingTypeID=78&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=2DD4C761-4E6E-456C-BC17-1A1688FC5636&amp;amp;filingTypeID=60&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=E5684A91-9607-4A0B-87F1-EA443F8D37F6&amp;amp;filingTypeID=69&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=E2E9D5CA-1146-418C-A497-9D94752B8273&amp;amp;filingTypeID=51&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; — all of which proposed making it mandatory that copies of papers from federally funded research be deposited in an Open Access repository after some period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8QpzXj&quot;&gt;In 2015, Elsevier sued the piracy site AvaxHome for $37.5 million. Then, the UK-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Publishing Association&lt;/a&gt;, of which Elsevier was a member, and the AAP, where Elsevier was joined by closely associated publisher, the &lt;em&gt;American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ACS&lt;/em&gt;), also successfully filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/988850e0-038c-11e5-a70f-00144feabdc0&quot;&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; against a slew of ebook pirates — including AvaxHome, LibGen, Ebookee, Freebookspot, Freshwap, Bookfi, and Bookre — mandating that ISPs block customers’ access to them. Later, it also attempted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/discomemor.pdf&quot;&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; Cloudflare, an internet security service, to turn over logs that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/elsevier-wants-cloudflare-to-expose-pirate-sites-160917/&quot;&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; the operators of LibGen and Bookfi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7faHiJ&quot;&gt;Elsevier hadn’t gotten the laws it wanted, ones that would have allowed it to pressure ISPs, payment services, and other internet intermediaries to block sites accused of piracy. So instead, it steadily set court precedents that did the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bETtUj&quot;&gt;Elsevier doesn’t oppose Open Access, says the Coalition for Responsible Sharing’s Milne. “I can say with confidence that all the members of the Coalition (Elsevier included) embrace open access,” Milne says. (He refused to answer any line of questioning that focused too heavily on any one publisher’s actions.) Every one of the members of the coalition has their own Open Access journals. And they all also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/98619/Sample-P-copyright-2.pdf&quot;&gt;allow&lt;/a&gt; scientists to upload a copy of preprint, non-peer-reviewed papers to Open Access archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Odgmzt&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The publishers’ sales teams have heard “individual institutions and consortiums” name-drop Researchgate and pirate sites like Sci-Hub to get leverage in price negotiations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eCHudT&quot;&gt;The actions of the publishers in the coalition have simply shown an opposition to illegal and unauthorized sharing, Milne says. Before Elsevier and ACS &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/publishers-take-researchgate-court-alleging-massive-copyright-infringement&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Researchgate, they tried for two years to convince the site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elseviers-contribution-to-the-stm-voluntary-principles-consultation-request&quot;&gt;adopt&lt;/a&gt; their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-assoc.org/2015_06_08_Voluntary_principles_for_article_sharing_on_scholarly_collaboration_networks.pdf&quot;&gt;Voluntary Principles on Article Sharing,&lt;/a&gt;” which would allow scientists to share articles — though only between others in their research groups, and provided that articles’ metadata wasn’t changed, preventing publishers from collecting accurate data on articles’ sharing statistics. Before suing Sci-Hub, Elsevier attempted to stop Elbakyan technically. The publishers feel they’ve been patient in enforcing copyright claims, particularly considering that, as Milne tells me, their sales teams have heard “individual institutions and consortiums,” which he is not at liberty to name, name-drop Researchgate and pirate sites like Sci-Hub to get leverage in price negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;T6nayB&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub’s burgeoning reach and reputation painted a target on Elbakyan’s back. Nonetheless, by the time Elsevier took aim, Elbakyan was already a woman on a mission. Sci-Hub was about to become more to Elbakyan than a “side project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;T2zQrv&quot;&gt;“With LibGen, I saw that it is possible to accumulate 10 million scientific articles,” she says. After that, she figured “[why] not download all the scientific articles that are currently listed in cross-reference database?” With PayPal now closed to her, she simply turned to bitcoin donations to keep feeding Sci-Hub’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XlvCtg&quot;&gt;Elbakyan had been pursuing a master’s program on public administration (which, she tells me, would’ve allowed her to make the “upgrade” to her living conditions she’d long been jonesing for) at Russia’s National Research University. She’d hoped it would let her influence internet information-sharing legislation. But in 2014, Elbakyan left, disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JXlb0G&quot;&gt;She switched to a master’s program in religious studies, where her thesis led her to research how ancient societies treated information distribution. Both the revelations about the ancient societies and their attitudes toward ”information openness,” and the “feeling that [public administration] wasn’t quite the direction that I wanted to go” led her to double down on Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cAwpQd&quot;&gt;Elbakyan created several more backup copies of Sci-Hub’s database. She rewrote Sci-Hub’s code, starting from square one, so that the service could download papers automatically. Now, once users pointed Sci-Hub toward an article, the site would check every university proxy server until it found one through which it could download the paper, and would download it automatically. They didn’t have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/some-facts-on-sci-hub-that-wikipedia-gets-wrong/&quot;&gt;manually&lt;/a&gt; browse the publisher’s website through Sci-Hub to find the articles anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lEQBgi&quot;&gt;Elbakyan had defied Elsevier. Her former hobby had become her primary focus. Nothing would make her waiver from making Sci-Hub a titan of Open Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0KLqgt&quot;&gt;Until, that is, the Kremlin unintentionally accomplished what Elsevier couldn’t: it got Sci-Hub shut down — at least in Russia. After an isolationist policy enacted by the Kremlin sparked intense bickering between scientists and Elbakyan, she pulled the plug herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;D81yIj&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;6B3KU6&quot;&gt;In May 2015, as part of a sweeping effort to insulate Russia from foreign influence, the Kremlin labeled Russia’s only private funder and popularizer of scientific research, the Dynasty Foundation, a “foreign agent.” Unlike much of the scientific community, Elbakyan was happy about change. However, her reaction would spark what she saw as cyberbullying from her opponents, prompting her to shut down Sci-Hub in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ilM9b1&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elbakyan’s reaction to what she saw as cyberbullying would prompt her to shut down Sci-Hub in Russia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Q94lmR&quot;&gt;About three years before the Dynasty incident, the Kremlin adopted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_foreign_agent_law&quot;&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; that required any organization with foreign funding not strictly involved with “science, culture, art, healthcare, charity,” and a laundry list of other activities, to register as a “foreign agent.” This barred those organizations from any further political activity, and raised a red flag for any associated groups. Charities, NGOs, and many &lt;a href=&quot;http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/49570/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-New_laws_that_cast_NGOs_as_foreign_agents_illustrate_the_threat_to_academic_collaboration_in_Russia.pdf&quot;&gt;social scientists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://meduza.io/en/feature/2016/04/25/from-charity-to-treason&quot;&gt;decried&lt;/a&gt; the law, refusing to register. They argued that “political activity” was vaguely described, and that the law would cripple vital international collaboration. So, in 2014, the Kremlin amended the law so organizations could be labeled involuntarily. By July of last year, 88 organizations had become “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/russia-government-against-rights-groups-battle-chronicle&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/a&gt; agents,” and the law had sparked protests from human rights groups calling it a crackdown on freedom of expression and LGBTQ rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yok13G&quot;&gt;Dynasty was founded in 2002 by Dmitry Zimin, a beloved philanthropic oligarch whose work had even won him an award from the government “for the Protection of the Russian Science” just weeks earlier. By American standards, Dynasty wasn’t that deep-pocketed. In 2015, its anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dynastyfdn.com/english/about&quot;&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; for research funding amounted to just $7.6 million USD. And yet, in Russia, it had no peer as a private supporter of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;feRHxF&quot;&gt;However, Dynasty had always been heavily involved in education: funding research, supporting high school science programs, and training science teachers, among other things. In order to continue the same line of work, the fund would now somehow have to tiptoe through its involvement in the education system without doing anything that the Kremlin could construe as political activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3V3eem&quot;&gt;Through Dynasty, Zimin supported another one of his organizations, the Liberal Mission Foundation (LMF). It was effectively a think tank that assisted education initiatives that taught modern political science from a liberal perspective in Russian schools — including Elbakyan’s. This is ostensibly what qualified as “political activity.” And though Zimin was a Russian national, he kept the money with which he supported Dynasty in foreign banks — making it fair game to be considered foreign funding. (In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Frussia-cracks-down-on-charities&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Zimin said, “The Russian government also keeps its money abroad,” likely referencing the fact that the Kremlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Frussia-cracks-down-on-charities&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt; billions in US bonds.) Together, Zimin’s “foreign” money and Dynasty’s relation to the LMF provided the excuse for the “foreign agent” label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UrBiMk&quot;&gt;Zimin was likely interesting for other reasons, though. Not only did he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khodorkovsky.com/you-dont-like-what-were-doing-so-well-stop-it/&quot;&gt;attend&lt;/a&gt; 2012 anti-Putin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/anti-putin-protests-moscow-russia&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow, he also supported a free press. In 2014, when Zimin’s cable company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeline_(brand)&quot;&gt;Beeline&lt;/a&gt;, was forced by the government to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/world/europe/independent-news-station-feeling-kremlins-wrath-asks-why.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozhd&quot;&gt;Dozhd&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s only major liberal, independent TV news station, Zimin said, “I think that everyone understands that this is not Beeline’s decision.” Afterward, he went on to bankroll a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/3030/founder-of-beeline-opens-fund-in-support-of-independent-media&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/3030/founder-of-beeline-opens-fund-in-support-of-independent-media&quot;&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/russian-tv-station-forced-air-two-years-makes-comeback-952155&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%922&quot;&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lEJ4ot&quot;&gt;The government never cited these incidents as part of its reason for labeling Dynasty and the LMF as “foreign agents,” though Zimin’s past ventures do raise some suspicion about the Kremlin’s motives. Nevertheless, Zimin decided to shutter Dynasty, to get the LMF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbth.com/news/2015/09/15/liberal_mission_foundation_removed_from_foreign_agents_list_49260.html&quot;&gt;taken off&lt;/a&gt; the “foreign agent” list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;4Q79u9&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elbakyan contends that Dynasty is somehow Sci-Hub’s capitalistic foil&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;P25sYr&quot;&gt;Many scientists protested, but Elbakyan didn’t understand the outrage. As far as she was concerned, Dynasty — particularly through its funding of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dynastyfdn.com/english/programs/society/liberal&quot;&gt;LMF&lt;/a&gt; — had spread “propaganda against Putin and the Russian authorities.” She describes Zimin’s work through Dynasty, and the organization itself, as “anti-communist,” though she’s vague about how. Elbakyan says the foundation and Sci-Hub are “ideologically opposed,” and contends that Dynasty is somehow Sci-Hub’s capitalistic foil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Viy1KC&quot;&gt;“I knew about this fund firsthand. It was involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hse.ru/en/&quot;&gt;Higher School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; where I was studying,” Elbakyan says. So, she began writing posts presenting instances of Dynasty supporting liberal-leaning groups. She asserts that she didn’t want to “[argue] any kind of side.” But the posts read with surprising acrimony for someone ostensibly attempting to be objective. She dubbed Dynasty’s supporters “the Brigades of the ‘Dynasty.’” She also re-shared negative articles about Dynasty that were written by state-controlled media outlets, and even shared Photoshopped pictures doctored to cast Zimin in a blatantly suspicious light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nh4jW9&quot;&gt;Shortly afterward, something strange happened. Former members of Sci-Hub’s vKontakte group began saying that Elbakyan, a champion of Open Access to information, had blocked them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8VyHIN&quot;&gt;“They just started launching just really personal and low bar attacks on me personally, calling me names, spreading false information about me, calling me crazy, etc.” So she threw them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OEeFQS&quot;&gt;Many of the former members of Sci-Hub’s vKontakte group say that they simply got booted for supporting Dynasty. One scientist, Dmitry Perekalin of Nesmeyanov Institute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vk.com/wall8206985?offset=80&amp;amp;own=1&amp;amp;w=wall8206985_2080&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that Elbakyan asked her group to vote on which was better for Russian science, Sci-Hub or Dynasty. “I wrote that it was a false dilemma and was immediately banned,” Perekalin said in a vKontakte &lt;a href=&quot;https://vk.com/wall8206985?offset=80&amp;amp;own=1&amp;amp;w=wall8206985_2080&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Elbakyan &lt;a href=&quot;http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/06/the-worlds-largest-free-scientific-resource-is-now-blocked-in-russia/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Sci-Hub in Russia for several days (though many people could still access it through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-35328636/technology-explained-what-is-a-vpn-service&quot;&gt;Virtual Private Networks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;hDd1VJ&quot;&gt;Shortly after the Dynasty controversy at home, Elbakyan discovered that Elsevier was suing her and LibGen abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mYGzFV&quot;&gt;“I did not believe that it’s possible to win against such a well-funded, rich, and influential company,” says Elbakyan. Rather than fight the case, she’d just keep an eye on it from afar. Money aside, “I would have had to provide certain documents that potentially could have exposed me or my physical location.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5MOrLn&quot;&gt;Elsevier’s lawsuit was a &lt;em&gt;civil&lt;/em&gt; case, for which extraditing someone to the US from abroad to be tried is generally against the law. Still, Elbakyan worried about being extradited. “I do know about stories where hackers that left Russia or Ukraine for Europe or the United States were unexpectedly arrested.” Although, the main reference she cites is the arrest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/waw/press/2012/July/zubakha.html&quot;&gt;Dmitry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/259548/hacker_arrested_for_2008_ddos_attacks_on_amazon_com.html&quot;&gt;Zubaka&lt;/a&gt;, who had &lt;em&gt;criminal&lt;/em&gt; charges against him for a cyberattack against Amazon. Nonetheless, since her last visit in 2010 to speak at Harvard, she’s had no intention of returning to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;k7jRXm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I did not believe that it’s possible to win against such a well-funded, rich, and influential company.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yDXudD&quot;&gt;Court &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/Elsevier_v_Sci-Hub/2015-06-11*/DECLARATION%20of%20Anthony%20Woltermann/Elsevier_Inc_et_al_v_Sci-Hub_et_al__nysdce-15-04282__0008.0.pdf&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; reveal that Elsevier had been playing cat-and-mouse with Elbakyan, working with universities to block her access to the university proxies Sci-Hub used to access their journals. Elsevier’s technicians were able to identify many source IP addresses associated with university computing systems that looked suspicious. They alerted institutions about these breaches, so that the schools could block these proxies’ credentials. However, Elbakyan had penetrated too many universities, and not every school had the technical expertise to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L6HtPB&quot;&gt;Elsevier steadily shut down student accounts whose credentials Elbakyan was using to access Elsevier’s database, Science Direct. By doing this, it had “vastly reduced” her access to its articles. On Sci-Hub’s Twitter page, Elbakyan even complained about this, saying that “[due] to the huge amount of accounts that were closed recently we were forced to introduce limits on the maximum number of users, especially foreigners.” She had to prioritize the access of “former USSR countries,” says Elbakyan. “Access from China and Iran was blocked for some time because Sci-Hub couldn’t serve as many requests as were coming from these countries. She also made Sci-Hub inaccessible to Americans (except those using VPNs) — in part because of the number of download requests, but also because she wanted to avoid becoming a target for lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7bc6td&quot;&gt;Then, Elbakyan switched her strategy. As Elsevier’s technicians testified, instead of using university proxy servers to access Elsevier’s repository directly, Sci-Hub started using them just to obtain an authorization token. Then Sci-Hub could use the token to connect to the repository from a different IP address — no longer leaving an easy breadcrumb trail of the same handful of IP address being consistently used to access and download an outrageous number of papers. By the time the publisher had gone to trial, it still hadn’t figured out any effective workaround to this technique. But, Elsevier had found a different pressure point for enforcing piracy that would establish a precedent for another publisher to get something of a chokehold on Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NbEQQN&quot;&gt;Elsevier was awarded $15 million in June. Thanks to an injunction included in the suit, Elbakyan lost the domain Sci-Hub.org as well as Sci-Hub’s Twitter account — but, according to Elbakyan, not before the media coverage boosted Sci-Hub’s usership by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TUdCj3&quot;&gt;“I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; disappointed in the results of the lawsuit,” she says. “[That] public opinion and the position of modern society did not correspond with the justice’s decision” was a blow. “As far as the amount is concerned,” Elbakyan says that she couldn’t pay $15 million even if she wanted, as she is getting “only few thousand a month” in donations. She may be undercounting. One 2017 &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/preprints/3100/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that Sci-Hub owned $268,000 in unspent bitcoin as of August 2017. (Though Elbakyan has publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sci_hub/status/892751909530071040?lang=ar&quot;&gt;disagreed&lt;/a&gt; with that estimate, she hasn’t said how much she owns in bitcoin. She claims the exact amount is confidential.) Nonetheless, since Elbakyan lives outside the US, she can’t be compelled to pay. “I was actually flattered that my project was evaluated so highly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5Ls5oN&quot;&gt;A week later, Elbakyan discovered she was being sued again, this time by the scientific society and publisher ACS. The suit was a long time coming. ACS publications rank among the most-covered by Sci-Hub. To date, Sci-Hub holds copies of 98.8 &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenelab.github.io/scihub/#/publishers&quot;&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; of all of ACS’s research. Until November, when ACS was &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fpirate-paper-website-sci-hub-dealt-another-blow-by-us-courts-1.22971&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; $4.8 million, she admits that she didn’t follow the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ldg0as&quot;&gt;But ACS proved more formidable than Elsevier — winning not only the suit, but an &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sciinjunc.pdf&quot;&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; demanding that “any Internet search engines, web hosting and Internet service providers, domain name registrars, and domain name registries,” stop doing anything to make Sci-Hub’s operation — and piracy — possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a8i23c&quot;&gt;Legal and tech &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) immediately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/11/another-court-overreaches-site-blocking-order-targeting-sci-hub&quot;&gt;decried&lt;/a&gt; the injunction. It went too far, the EFF said, setting a precedent eerily similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/16/2641391/the-stop-online-piracy-act-the-sopa-story-so-far&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/22/2648219/stop-online-piracy-act-sopa-what-is-it&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; legislation would’ve worked: ACS theoretically could strong-arm any service that could be seen as aiding Sci-Hub. Forcing internet intermediaries to enforce copyright claims by shutting down accused sites wholesale makes it possible for copyright holders to abuse claims of infringement, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/about/staff/mitch-stoltz&quot;&gt;Mitch Stoltz&lt;/a&gt;, a senior staff attorney at the EFF. If a website can “disappear on command” without any oversight, there is no incentive to encourage copyright holders to be judicious. Even if a website simply advertises or links to another infringing site, or unintentionally has a few unauthorized reproductions of copyrighted works, not only &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; a copyright holder black out the site entirely, it would be relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U9IdWz&quot;&gt;The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a tech nonprofit with members such as Google, Intuit, Uber, and Microsoft, even filed an amicus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/ccia-proposed-brief-acs-v-does-sci-hub&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; against ACS’s injunction — just as it &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Elsevier-v-Sci-Hub-Amicus-6.26.15.pdf&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; when Elsevier, in its case, initially attempted to get a similar injunction — urging the court to drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yme1Vo&quot;&gt;ACS’s injunction wasn’t the first such web-blocking order — and though ACS said that it wouldn’t pursue ISPs or search engines not in “active participation” with Sci-Hub, the case is one of several that are increasingly making ISPs the pressure points of enforcing copyright. The list of governments that have blocked the site PirateBay by pressuring ISPs into denying access to the site has its own Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_blocking_access_to_The_Pirate_Bay&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;. The aforementioned AAP and UK Publishers Association case against several ebook pirates also pressured ISPs into blocking access to those sites. Earlier this year, a coalition of Hollywood organizations &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-aussie-isps-to-block-dozens-of-pirate-sites-170818/&quot;&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; Australian ISPs to block dozens of piracy sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SkX9Ai&quot;&gt;Last year in a landmark American case, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/12/the-copyright-case-that-should-worry-all-internet-providers/?utm_term=.23be5eca472f&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; “The Copyright Case that Should Worry all Internet Providers,” a court determined that the ISP Cox (a former head of its Abuse Group, even went so far as to say in one email “f the dmca!!!”) had flagrantly disregarded its responsibility to make &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; effort to enforce piracy. Thus, it didn’t qualify for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fbmg-v-cox-new-era-copyright-liability-internet-service-stacey-gilman%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;safe harbor&lt;/a&gt;” protection, which grants a measure of legal immunity to ISPs that make adequate efforts to curb piracy. Without that protection, Cox lost a lawsuit to the music rights group BMG, which had hired a third-party organization to levy fees from Cox customers found to be accessing accused piracy sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tsTdRc&quot;&gt;After the ACS ruling, a few Sci-Hub domains (.ac, .io, and .cc) stopped working, says Elbakyan. In response, she used Twitter to tell users how to change their settings to get around the blocks. “It’s useful to know how to go around domain blocking,” she says. However, since then, she’s lost Sci-Hub’s. bz domain — announcing on vKontakte that “the capitalists have started blocking Sci-Hub domains, so the site may not be accessible at the regular addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;aqJZJv&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sci-Hub isn’t going anywhere. Elbakyan has spare domains. She’s backed up her repository of articles.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6ipSjk&quot;&gt;“I do not endorse illegal means for providing Open Access,” says Harvard’s Peter Suber. “For most of Sci-Hub’s existence, I went out of my way to dissociate myself from it because it gave Open Access a bad name.” However, Suber says, Sci-Hub isn’t going anywhere. Elbakyan agrees. She has spare domains. She’s backed up her repository of articles. According to her, even if ACS pressures search engines to black out search results, it won’t matter: only 25 percent of Sci-Hub referrals come via search engines anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;G49Q03&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub is often called the Pirate Bay of science; the Pirate Bay itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-remains-on-top-11-years-after-the-raid-170531/&quot;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/pirate-bay-raided-taken-down/&quot;&gt;raided&lt;/a&gt; twice before it finally succumbed. “If nothing happens to me personally, then naturally I will try to continue Sci-Hub project myself,” Elbakyan says. If something were to happen, while her network of journal and institutional subscriptions might be lost, “the main resource of the project, being the scientific articles, they are already published on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xWFsR9&quot;&gt;Elbakyan faces an uphill battle. ACS has yet to show what it defines as “active participation.” If Sci-Hub’s Twitter page were to get taken down again, it would hobble the word-of-mouth network perpetuating Sci-Hub and ACS’s current domain-name whack-a-mole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7Wdhd7&quot;&gt;As copyright holders continue establishing even more precedents of compelling ISPs to enforce copyright disputes, other publishers may well follow suit. The Trump administration has expanded ISPs’ ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/04/internet-censorship-is-advancing-under-trump/&quot;&gt;surveil&lt;/a&gt; customers. Net neutrality, which prevented ISPs from biasing speed, connectivity, and access to some sites over others, has been revoked as well, which means ISPs may get much more discretion in how they enforce piracy. These policy changes place Sci-Hub on a more tenuous footing in the US. But if America’s access were further restricted, it would be a blow to the site, and to many of the “capitalists” that use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IshusK&quot;&gt;Despite this, Elbakyan (and Suber) plan to continue with business as usual. Suber will keep pushing for the expansion of Open Access journals and repositories despite publishers’ lobbying. Elbakyan plans to handwave away any more lawsuits and play whatever game of cat-and-mouse she must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MWlqEk&quot;&gt;As for the publishers, it seems their attention may be shifting to scientists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F7Lp6n&quot;&gt;Since 2015, many publishers, including ACS and Elsevier, have pushed their STM voluntary principles for article sharing: a series of rules for researchers and networking sites for scientists on how they can share their research. More recently, at least nine of the largest publishers are actively promoting howcanishareit.com as the go-to reference for scientists looking to learn about publishers’ rules on how they can share their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4k2REe&quot;&gt;At first glance, these initiatives seem like pushes for increasing the accessibility of research. Upon closer examination, a number of holes in publishers’ advocacy for access become evident: the voluntary principles focus chiefly on giving researchers guidelines on sharing papers only within small collaborative research groups, not the larger public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8FnDlU&quot;&gt;Howcanishareit.com offers advice on how scientists can share their research, but buries mention of Open Access journals in links to academic editorials. Similarly, any mention that scientists are allowed to upload preprints to repositories are sequestered in links to individual publishers’ contracts. Several for-profit repositories and Scholarly Collaboration Networks (SCNs) are advertised, but major nonprofit Open Access repositories like &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt;, Arxiv, and bioRxiv are conspicuously absent. Overall, the site reads like an attempt to “educate” scientists away from more traditional Open Access infrastructure, and, if not to constrain their sharing, then to redirect it toward for-profit platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;mdrB8Q&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legal campaigns against Sci-Hub have made the site more well-known than most repositories, and Elbakyan more famous than legal Open Access champions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0rp4Qc&quot;&gt;Legal Open Access activists like Suber have disagreed with this limited interpretation of Open Access. “The benefits of OA come from sharing with the public, or with everyone who might want to read your research, cite it, apply it, or build on it,” not just SCNs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;My4bsw&quot;&gt;These campaigns could erode the base of the Legal Open Access movement: scientists’ awareness of their options for sharing research. Elbakyan, on the other hand, would be left unaffected. The legal campaigns against Sci-Hub have — through the Streisand effect — made the site more well-known than most mainstay repositories, and Elbakyan more famous than legal Open Access champions like Suber. The threat posed by ACS’s injunction against Sci-Hub has increased support for the site from web activists organizations such as the EFF, which considesr the site “a symptom of a serious problem: people who can’t afford expensive journal subscriptions, and who don’t have institutional access to academic databases, are unable to use cutting-edge scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;rl4DAR&quot;&gt;The effort may backfire. It does nothing to address disappointment scientists feel about how paywalls hide their work. Meanwhile, Sci-Hub has been making waves that might carry it further to a wider swath of both the public and the scientific community. And though Elbakyan might be sailing in dangerous waters, what’s to stop idealistic scientists who are frustrated with the big publishers from handing over their login credentials to Sci-Hub’s pirate queen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Benjamin “Benjy” Stacy was born 1975, nurses and doctors were shocked and confused. Rather than coming out a bright shade of crimson like most babies, Benjy was born with dark blue skin. Doctors were so worried by this alien skin color that they called an ambulance to take Benjy the 116 miles from his hometown outside Hazard, Kentucky to the University of Kentucky Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days of testing, the doctors were no closer to understanding why little Benjy’s skin was blue. Then Benjy’s grandmother spoke up, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiana.edu/~oso/lessons/Blues/TheBlues.htm&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt;, “Have you ever heard of the blue Fugates of Troublesome Creek?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, Benjy’s father, Alva Stacy, explained to the doctors, “My grandmother Luna on my dad’s side was a blue Fugate. It was real bad in her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjy Stacy was the latest child born in a long line of Fugates – the blue people of Kentucky – who had lived in the Appalachian mountains of Kentucky for the past 197 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Fugate in the United States was a French orphan named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiana.edu/~oso/lessons/Blues/TheBlues.htm&quot;&gt;Martin Fugate&lt;/a&gt;, who settled in Troublesome Creek in the hills of eastern Kentucky in 1820. He married a woman named Elizabeth Smith, who was said to be as pale and white as the mountain laurel that blooms every spring around the creek hollows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to either of them, by some incalculable odds, both possessed a recessive gene that led to four of the seven children of this union being born with blue skin. In those days in rural eastern Kentucky, there were no roads, and a railroad wouldn’t even reach that part of the state until the early 1910s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_131115&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-131115&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-131115 post-img-landscape&quot; src=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bridge-creek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Troublesome Creek&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; srcset=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bridge-creek.jpg 597w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bridge-creek-300x190.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-131115&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Kentucky Digital Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-body&quot;&gt;Troublesome Creek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, many of the Fugates began to marry and have children within their own bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was hard to get out, so they intermarried,” says Dennis Stacy, an amateur genealogist, and descendant of the Fugates. “I’m kin to myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjy is descended from a line of this family that began when Martin’s son, Zachariah, married his mother’s sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of genetic isolation allowed for the continued reproduction and expression of the Fugate family’s “blue skin” gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_131099&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-131099&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-131099 post-img-landscape&quot; src=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fugate-family.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fugate Family Tree&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; srcset=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fugate-family.jpg 700w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fugate-family-300x207.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-131099&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;The Fugate Family Newsletter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-body&quot;&gt;The Fugate family tree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next hundred or so years, the Fugates continued to live in relative isolation and were accepted by the people of Troublesome Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They looked like anybody else, ‘cept they had the blue color,” said one resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, by the early 1960s, some members of the Fugate clan had begun to resent their cobalt-tinted skin. Not only did their skin mark them as different, but by that time, people had already begun to associate their skin color with the family’s history of inbreeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that two Fugates approached Madison Cawein, a hematologist at the University of Kentucky’s medical clinic at the time, in search of a cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were really embarrassed about being blue,” Cawein remembers. “Patrick was all hunched down in the hall. Rachel was leaning against the wall. They wouldn’t come into the waiting room. You could tell how much it bothered them to be blue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using research collected from studies of isolated Alaskan Eskimo populations, Cawein was able to conclude that the Fugates carried a rare hereditary blood disorder that causes excessive levels of methemoglobin in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methemoglobin is a nonfunctional blue version of the healthy red hemoglobin protein that carries oxygen. In most Caucasians, the red hemoglobin of the blood in their bodies shows through their skin giving it a pink tint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Fugate family, the excessive amount of blue methemoglobin in their blood turned their skin color blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blood disorder is the result of a recessive gene, and so requires that both parents of a child have the recessive gene for the disorder to appear in their offspring. Without the Fugate’s intense isolation and inbreeding, this disorder would be incredibly rare in their bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_131102&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-131102&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-131102 post-img-portrait&quot; src=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/recessive-gene-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;How recessive genes are passed&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;585&quot; srcset=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/recessive-gene-flow.png 500w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/recessive-gene-flow-256x300.png 256w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-131102&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-body&quot;&gt;How recessive genes are passed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cawein devised a cure for this disorder: more blue. Counterintuitively, the best chemical for activating the body’s process of turning methemoglobin to hemoglobin is methylene blue dye. The Fugates he treated ingested this dye and within a few minutes, the blue coloration of their skin disappeared, and their skin turned pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as they kept ingesting pills of the substance regularly, these blue people of Kentucky could live their lives normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of months of his birth, Benjy’s skin color began to change to the average color for a baby. By the age of seven, he had lost nearly all of this blue coloring, indicating that he likely only received a copy of the gene from one parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjy likely had this gene passed down from his father’s grandmother, Luna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Luna was bluish all over. Her lips were as dark as a bruise. She was as blue a woman as I ever saw,” said local nurse Carrie Lee Kilburn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_131103&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-131103&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-131103 post-img-landscape&quot; src=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/benjy-stacy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Benjy Stacy&quot; width=&quot;634&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; srcset=&quot;https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/benjy-stacy.jpg 634w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/benjy-stacy-300x291.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-131103&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-body&quot;&gt;Benjy Stacy at 37.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though today Benjy and most of the Fugate family descendants have lost their blue coloring, the tint still comes out in their skin when they are cold or flush with anger. In those moments, the legacy of the blue Fugates of Kentucky lives on — a legacy of hardship, isolation, and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Culture Fit Interview Questions</title>
<link>https://hire.google.com/articles/culture-fit-interview-questions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hire.google.com/articles/culture-fit-interview-questions/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Top Culture-Fit Interview Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of these questions as conversation starters. They are a springboard for a deeper discussion about how a candidate could potentially fit into the culture of your organization. This is your chance to convey the values of your company to the candidate and identify potential concerns or red flags about their fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Why do you want to work for our company?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most candidates will probably be prepared to answer this common question. Nonetheless, it's a great starting point for assessing the candidate's knowledge and expectations of your company. Sofia Quintero, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://getenjoyhq.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EnjoyHQ&lt;/a&gt;, advises that interviewers “focus on understanding the underlying motivations of the candidate. Ask what success looks like to them and how they see your company helping them achieve their personal goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions, nor do you want candidates to just parrot talking points about your company. What you are looking for with this answer is self-awareness and a peek into the respondent's core motivations for seeking this role. It's a great sign if they can point out the ways they will fit in with or strengthen your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Why are those attributes important to you? How do you see yourself fitting into our company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. How would you describe the culture at previous companies you’ve worked at?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting candidates to talk about their past experiences gives you insight into their views and opinions on company culture. It's a good jumping-off point to discuss how your company culture stacks up against a candidate's past experiences. Shrav Mehta from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pilot&lt;/a&gt; likes this question because finding out what the candidate liked and disliked about past companies “can yield some insight into what is valuable to the candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their answer should illuminate the kind of cultural environment your candidate is used to working in, and their attitude about that environment. This can help you determine whether your company's structure and atmosphere align with the candidate's preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you enjoy working in that company culture? What does a healthy work culture mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Tell me about a time you solved a problem at work. What was the issue, and how did you approach it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a candidate recount anecdotes from their past can open a window into their decision-making process and their behavior at work. In this instance, you're asking them to illuminate their ability to problem-solve by providing real-life examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual problem they describe is unimportant; what matters is how they approached it and how that attitude aligns with your company's values. Some companies stress the importance of teamwork and asking for help, while other companies encourage independent troubleshooting and initiative. Make sure that your candidate can fulfill the job's responsibilities by using the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you wish you had done differently? What would you have done if (XYZ) resource wasn't available to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Tell me about a team project you did at work. What was the project, what was your role, and what was the outcome?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking a leading question like, “Do you prefer working on a team?” ask them to describe a real-life example of their ability to be a team player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate's answer will show you a number of things. Did they like being part of a team? Do they blame others for failures or take responsibility? Do they say they did most of the work, or do they give credit to teammates? The answers to these questions can help you determine how they might fit in with your existing team and what kind of coworker they would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you think the team could have done differently to improve results? What role would you like to play if you were to repeat that same project with a new team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. How do you like to be managed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/relationship-management/pages/creating-a-supportive-workplace.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thrive under their supervisor&lt;/a&gt; are able to do their best work, while those who struggle with their managers are more likely to underperform or leave the company. With this question, your goal isn't to determine the type of management style the candidate prefers; you're looking for self-awareness about their work preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the candidate know what they want from management, and can they ask for it? Do they know how to manage themselves? Do they know what type of direction they best respond to? How flexible can they be? Most managers can accommodate workers with different preferences, but only if the employee can be vocal about what they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Tell me about a disagreement you had with your last manager. What was the issue, and how did you approach the situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. What does your perfect workday look like? Take me through it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is one of Sofia Quintero's favorites: “This normally helps me understand what they value on a daily basis. Do they value routine and structure? Are they more productive in specific conditions? It tells me a little bit about how they treat themselves and that, in my opinion, is a good measure of how they will treat others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good answer to this question shows self-awareness and a level of professional maturity. Do they have a best practice for tackling email versus deep-concentration work? Do they protect their time from distractions? Do they know they need routine and build it, or do they know they need creative freedom and set the conditions for that themselves? It's also a good sign if they show a level of flexibility and an awareness that nobody has an ideal schedule every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: What gets you excited about coming to work? What would make you dread coming to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Provide an example of a time when you went out of your way to delight a customer.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If customer service is highly valued by your company, you can use this question to test your candidate's commitment to that value. You will learn far more by asking them to name an example of their customer service prowess than you will by simply asking if they believe in delighting customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they able to come up with a good example, and does it reflect well on them? If they can't come up with a good story, or their example of “going out of their way” is something your company expects as standard, they may not match your values. But if they have several great stories that show a commitment to customer service, then they may be a good match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt;: What did you enjoy most about this interaction? Can you name a time when you weren't able to make a customer happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Describe your preferred relationship with coworkers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies put a premium on fostering a friendly work atmosphere, such as scheduling happy hours or team-building activities, and are looking for employees that value this same environment. Other companies find this to be a less important part of the culture. No matter where you land on the spectrum, it's a good idea to gauge a candidate's expectations and attitudes toward coworker relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your candidate all business, or do they treat coworkers like friends, and how do those views align with your workplace culture? If your employees are very social, then a candidate who yearns to cultivate deeper relationships with coworkers is a good fit. If your company prefers to keep relationships professional, then a party animal who loves community happy hour may not fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;: Talk about a time you had a conflict with a coworker and how you resolved it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cash/Consent: The war on sex work</title>
<link>https://nplusonemag.com/issue-35/essays/cashconsent/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nplusonemag.com/issue-35/essays/cashconsent/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro” intro&quot;&gt;My senior year&lt;/span&gt; of high school I worked in a coffee shop. I took the bus there after school and stole bagels to eat before my shifts, 3 &lt;span class=&quot;smallcap&quot;&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; to 11 &lt;span class=&quot;smallcap&quot;&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; most nights. I met a man there—let’s call him Mike. I was 16 when we met; he was 25. I was 18 when he took me to his place after work one night, poured us rum and Cokes until the stars spun above the roof where we sat, and then picked me up and carried me down to his bedroom. A few months later, I moved into his apartment. It was next to the airport, and the planes flew so low it seemed like we could touch them from the rooftop at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same year I entered a contest and won a $2,000 writing scholarship. It was 1999, and my plan was to take the money and go to New York. I’d been accepted to an undergraduate writing program at NYU, but I soon realized the money I’d won was not nearly enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike was always broke. I loved him or I thought I did. He knew more than me or I thought he did. I didn’t know then how little men’s attention was worth. I still believed there was a scarcity of it. He needed fifty bucks and I gave it to him. He needed a hundred. Then a little more. Soon I had given him all my money. It happened so easily. One day I realized it was all gone. I sat on the floor and cried. I was afraid that he would leave me, and I was afraid that I would never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after that, we were in bed together in the afternoon. I was naked, on top of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re so beautiful,” he said, “people would pay to look at you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a friend who had a website. The friend and another man would pick me up, bring me somewhere, and we would take some pictures. I would get $200; Mike would get $50. “But I’ll give all the money to you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t, but I believed him. I needed to. Recognizing one lie would mean recognizing all his lies. If that happened I would have nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Another way&lt;/span&gt; to tell the story is this: I was 19 and I was in love with Rosa. Rosa had been a dancer. She’d worked in a club in LA. She’d taken the job because she’d run out of toilet paper and pawned a gold bracelet her grandmother had given her and she needed to get her bracelet back. But it seemed like she loved the job. She told me that when she got up onstage she could be anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However I felt,” she said, “I would just dance it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me this in her bedroom, holding a sweating mason jar of vodka soda, wearing a white tank top with lacy straps. Her eyes shone. I wanted to kiss her almost as badly as I wanted to leave town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did kiss her, and I did leave town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid my way to San Francisco with the money I made from the shoot Mike set me up with. It was a move that, eventually, saved my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;I didn’t know it&lt;/span&gt; at the time, but that fall my body was the site of international debate about sex, work, poverty, and consent. In 2000, two pieces of legislation were passed that marked a new era in the criminalization of sex work: the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminists stood on both sides of the debate. Radical feminists and the religious right insisted that “voluntary prostitution” was an oxymoron and fought for both the UN Protocol and the TVPA to legally define all sex trading as nonconsensual sex trafficking. Liberal feminists and human rights organizations pushed to maintain a legal divide between voluntary and involuntary sex work. In the end, the liberal feminists won at the UN, but the TVPA offered a sweeping definition of sex trafficking as “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.” The definition included both voluntary and involuntary commercial sex, but, as a compromise, only criminalized “severe forms of trafficking in persons.” Severe forms were defined as circumstances in which “force, fraud, or coercion” were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The codified definitions offered by the TVPA and the UN Protocol did little to quell public disagreement about whether trading sex could be done voluntarily, or what the legal status of commercial sex should be. To the contrary, the passage of the TVPA set off nearly two decades in which more than fifty new state and federal laws were passed, each providing its own definitions of sex trafficking and prostitution. Since 2003, all fifty states have passed at least one law criminalizing sex trafficking. Many create civil as well as criminal liability, and many create third-party liability for businesses that “facilitate” trafficking or prostitution. In Pennsylvania, a 2014 trafficking law that creates a civil right of action for “victim[s] of the sex trade” defines &lt;em&gt;victim&lt;/em&gt; as anyone who has traded sex or has “been the object of a solicitation for prostitution.” In Louisiana, a 2017 trafficking law defines anyone who engages in a commercial sex act while under the age of 21 as a trafficking victim, regardless of consent. Many state trafficking laws make clear that a person having consented to trade sex is not a defense against a sex trafficking charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually worked with a camera in the room. That didn’t mean that the content of my work was performance rather than service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I done my first naked job as a 19-year-old in 2019 Louisiana, rather than where I was in 2000, I would have been considered a victim of trafficking. As it was, my experience easily fell within the TVPA’s definitions of “coercion” or “fraud,” which the Office on Trafficking in Persons says include “psychological manipulation” and “false promises regarding . . . love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all laws, the new trafficking statutes were formed by compromise and competing intentions. Laws do not develop their full meaning until they are used, and even after a law passes, advocates and state actors have the power to shape it. Following a century of racist anti-prostitution laws, the post-2000 anti-trafficking laws have been used by both lawmakers and social institutions to define all sex work as trafficking. The passage, use, and subsequent meaning of these laws have been pushed and shaped by far-right lawmakers, lobbyists, charity workers, and members of the now lucrative rescue industry, with the tacit—and sometimes not so tacit—goal of delegitimizing and criminalizing everyone who trades sex. FOSTA, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, signed into law in April 2018, is only the most visible recent iteration. Increased criminalization has resulted in declining labor conditions for people who trade sex. It has inhibited our ability to speak openly about these conditions. And it has made it harder for us to process our experiences—of coercion and exploitation, solidarity, love, and strength—in our own words, or even at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro” intro&quot;&gt;The room I found&lt;/span&gt; that I could afford in San Francisco was an hour train ride from the city’s only queer women’s bar, in a house owned by a woman to whom I had lied, during the interview, and said that I was straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing against lesbians,” she said. “I just don’t want to live with one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco I worked double shifts: opening shift at a day care and closing at a coffee shop. At the coffee shop, my manager developed what other people called a crush on me and started calling me from his home number. At first, he left relatively benign messages, asking me to go to a show with him. When I didn’t respond, he kept calling. His voice on the recorder grew tense, the messages increasingly threatening. “You should be more careful about how you talk to people,” he said. “You shouldn’t just smile at people like that.” I never responded to any of the calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work he began to berate me in front of customers and coworkers for small things—I had not refilled the coffee carafes quickly enough, the milk containers were empty. He manipulated my schedule so that I always worked alone. He stood beside me while I worked, not saying anything, not even looking at me, just keeping his large body close to mine. When I spoke to another manager about it, he said I should let it go. It wasn’t a big deal; the guy was just working out his hurt feelings. He said I shouldn’t have smiled at him like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first, incredibly lonely year, I made one friend, a straight woman named Kate who worked with me in the coffee shop. She had grown up in the city and had a group of friends with whom we got drunk on Saturday nights in the woods of Golden Gate Park, in someone’s apartment, or in someone’s parents’ garage. She told me about her eating disorder and I told her about how I’d made the money to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley was one of her friends. He belonged to a group of boys who I only ever saw together. One of them had a credit card. At some point after we met, they used it to pay to see me naked on the internet. On that day or soon after, Bradley told his friends that he was going to have sex with me. “He wants to fuck you,” one of them said. This was the way things were. If a boy said he wanted to fuck you, you were supposed to feel flattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt mostly alone. I was tired all the time. I could not see how my life was going to progress beyond making rent and passing my few free hours drinking with people I didn’t know very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, at someone’s apartment, I got drunk. If this were a movie, I was following the plot exactly. I wore red lipstick and tight pants and when Bradley handed me a red plastic Solo cup of unidentifiable liquor, I drank it. Then I drank another one. I danced with another girl. We rubbed our bodies together and the boys looked at us and we let them. I drank more and I danced more, and I got very drunk and I went into a bedroom and lay down on someone’s bed and fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard other people tell the stories of their rapes: time stopped, or there was a clock in the room and they watched it, or it seemed to go on forever. That was not my experience. I woke up and it was happening. He was on top of me and there was some pain, and it was very dark and everything was heavy and I could not move and I could smell him and I still smell him, and then it was over. I believed immediately that it was my fault. I was drunk and passing in and out of consciousness. Eventually, some weak, gray light came in through the window. His body was there on the bed. I stood up, carefully put my pants on, and carefully left. I rode the city bus back to the house I had lied to live in. I carefully showered, made a cup of coffee, and began the work of pretending it had not happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A year passed&lt;/span&gt; before&lt;/span&gt; I quit my job at the coffee shop and went back to doing sex work. By that time I was broke and exhausted and had a permanent shoulder injury from working the big steaming machines. One morning, another manager wrote me up for clocking in three minutes late. I took two of the free weekly papers into the back room and began to answer the back-page ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said things like: &lt;em&gt;Wanted: women age 18–22, make $$$ fast, no experience necessary, must be height-weight proportional.&lt;/em&gt; All the ads said that—&lt;em&gt;height-weight proportional&lt;/em&gt;—as though it had some objective meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the numbers at the bottom of the ads and tried to tell whether the men on the other end would hurt me. I was listening for something—too much urgency, too much desire or too little. Most of the time I went to meet them. I waited at a bus stop or a train station, where a car pulled up and a voice called out the name that I had made up for myself. I looked through the window to see whether the men inside were mean. I had this suspicion that I could tell by looking at them, which is how you can tell if men are mean in the movies. But in real life men can behave very well for a while and then suddenly hurt you and then behave well again. I knew this but was ignoring it. I had rent to pay. I got in the car and eyed the locks, checked the door handles, considered my escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time the men were fine. Most of the time they were profoundly boring. I went to their warehouses or their apartments and put on whatever pleated skirt they’d bought for the occasion. I put things inside of me: cocks, knife handles, fruit, toys. Afterward I cleaned myself up in the bathroom and rinsed my mouth, got my money, and got a ride back to the station and took the bus home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;In California&lt;/span&gt; and in New Hampshire,&lt;/span&gt; the law distinguishes between pornography and prostitution, the idea being that there’s a difference between paying someone for a sexual performance and paying someone for a sexual service. Catharine MacKinnon famously argued that to draw this distinction “is to deny the obvious: when you make pornography of a woman you make a prostitute out of her.” In a memo supporting their anti-pornography ordinance of 1983, MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin wrote that pornography’s meaning is “the graphic depiction of whores.” Their intention was to make people feel the same aversion to pornography they presumably felt to prostitution, an aversion largely based on the legal status of each industry. Hateful as their language is, in practice, the content of their statement was accurate: the legal distinction between pornography and prostitution is fallacious. I usually worked with a camera in the room. That didn’t mean that the content of my work was performance rather than service. Those lines were not clear then, and they were not clear later, when I worked for men in rooms without cameras. I always performed. I usually provided a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of distinguishing between pornography and prostitution, MacKinnon drew a different line. “Most of the time,” she wrote of women in pornography, “the sex they are shown having is with someone they have no sexual interest in, doing things that do nothing for them sexually . . . . They certainly never meaningfully consent to be intimately accessible to the thousands or millions of men they are then sold to.” For MacKinnon, money gives clarity to the exchange: “Throwing money at victims of sexual abuse does not make it a job, taking pictures of it does not make it freely chosen or desired. It makes it pictures of paid rape—rape in the real, if regrettably seldom in the legal, sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in those early years I knew the work was not how anti-sex-work feminists described it. I knew it was as good and as terrible as other, lower-wage work I’d done. I knew, too, how quickly people stopped listening when they began to feel pity. So I pretended. I pretended all of it was a kind of adventure. That what I gained from it was more than rent. I dismissed how much that rent meant to me. I pretended that I was not so poor, that I had not grown up poor. That I had not cried out of fear of not knowing where the money would come from next. That I did not steal food from every restaurant I ever worked in. That I never ate the food people left on their plates. That I did not watch movies about “college kids” with a gripping, painful yearning in every part of my body. That I did not come home from every sex-work job giddy at the possibility of ordering more takeout Chinese food than I could eat, giddy at having enough money to commit the thrill of waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also knew that the idea that I was “empowered” by trading sex was a lie. In the early 2000s, as some sex workers were organizing and holding public events in San Francisco, calling on queers and whores to unlearn our shame—intimating that it was our responsibility to the movements to unlearn our shame—I struggled with mine. There were days when men paid me less than they’d promised and I took it and said nothing. There were days when men wheedled me into something extra that I’d have charged more for if I’d been better at negotiating. There were days when men intentionally crossed every boundary I’d tried to set, and I felt ashamed that I had not stopped them. I felt shame when I didn’t want to go to a job I’d booked, when, instead of going to work, I sat down on the floor of my apartment and watched the phone ring. I admired the women I saw speaking in public, admired what looked to me like their power. I tried to mimic them, and there were moments when I thought I could. But more often, the ideal of the unashamed, empowered whore—the sex worker of the liberal imagination—was discouragingly unreachable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point a woman I was dating told me she’d called one of my regulars and gone to his house to masturbate for him. She told me the story as though we now had a shared experience. I could tell from her voice that breaking the social prohibition against being naked with strangers and being paid for it had given her a sense of freedom. This is, I think, what many sex workers and “sex-positive” feminists mean when they talk about empowerment. But when she told me the story, I felt ashamed again. I didn’t yet know that what I was feeling was class shame. I did sex work for the same reason I had always done wage labor: because I needed the money. There was no glorifying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet I knew that needing the money did not feel the same as not choosing. I knew that taking off my clothes in middle-aged men’s basements and condos did not feel the same as being raped felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;In 2003,&lt;/span&gt; the BDSM porn company&lt;/span&gt; I was working for took me to a weeklong convention in Las Vegas, where I roomed with a woman from San Francisco, Jessica. She loaned me her expensive shoes and together we walked through the casinos, elevated in our six-inch heels. She kept her body long, back straight, and eyes forward as she walked, and I watched as people’s stares slid right off her. Together in her shoes, we ate in the kinds of restaurants I had only ever bused tables in, where neon strip lights shimmered against plate glass and the knives on the white tablecloths shone under the low light of what, in my memory, were chandeliers—though in retrospect the restaurants were merely faux-fancy chains. She taught me how to wear makeup and I emulated her walk, her way of acting like she didn’t need men. She was good at setting boundaries, and I learned from watching her. Sometimes she was all business, just straight up “no.” Sometimes she said, “What if instead we do this other thing?” Sometimes she just laughed if someone asked her to do something she didn’t want to do, as though she thought they were joking—and it worked. Men would pretend they’d been kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the convention I began to travel to work for some of the men I’d met there. In 2005, a man I’d never met asked me to fly to another country to shoot for him. As soon as I saw him, I knew he was mean. He took me to the hotel where I would be staying and sat in the room with me, quietly smoking. I was with another performer I knew, but not well. We eyed each other. That week we shot BDSM scenes that were far more difficult than we’d negotiated. He wanted me to cry. He told me, smiling, that if I’d just cry the scene would end. They caned me and put needles in my skin, but I physically could not cry. He stayed with us nearly every minute of each day, exhaling in our faces a cloud of burnt tobacco. I remember thinking: I am here to work illegally. Who would I tell? At the end of the week he wouldn’t pay us. He said he’d mail the check. When he finally did, the amount was half of what we’d agreed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was border crossing, force, fraud, and coercion—trafficking in the most agreed-upon sense—but I didn’t think of it that way for years. Back home, I felt I couldn’t talk about what had happened. I knew it would be used to overshadow my understanding of other experiences at work, and I felt humiliated at having been tricked. A good whore, I thought, would at least have gotten her money. Years later, I texted with a friend about this. “No,” she said. “A good whore always &lt;em&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to get her money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2006, Jessica had started working for a man named Ron Kazlin. She called me from his car and put me on speaker. “Who’s this?” he said. “That little Lorelei? Yeah, I’ve heard about you.” Later I learned he called all his girls this: little Jessica, little Lili, little Paige. The next time Jessica came up to San Francisco for a shoot, she opened her daybook, pointed her glossy acrylics at each of the dates, and read aloud the amounts she’d written into them. “March 13: $1,000. March 16: $1,400. March 20: $1,000.” It was so much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer I called Kaz. He said, “I’ll get you work. But you gotta do what you say you’ll do. You say you’ll do anal, you say you’ll do DP, you do it. You don’t show up to set and tell them you don’t feel like it.” I sent him my pictures, got a test, flew to LA, and worked. Within two weeks of that phone call I had moved into his apartment. After that, I lived with Kaz for two to three weeks every month. For the next few years I only worked through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between three and six women crashed with Kaz at any given time. Others came by and stayed all day. We were his girls. We called his place the porn dorm or porno boot camp. I slept on the couch and followed Kaz’s rules: rules about how late we could be out of the apartment, rules about who we could date. We were not allowed to do drugs. We were not allowed to be late to set. Kazlin girls showed up on time and did the job we were hired to do. We had a good attitude, even when we were exhausted and even when we were booked with someone we did not like. We had a good attitude even at the eleventh hour of a twelve-hour shoot, when we were dehydrated and sore and drenched in sweat and Jake Malone wanted us to start a whole new scene, wanted latex opera gloves and squirt off the second-floor landing. We had a good attitude even at 2 &lt;span class=&quot;smallcap&quot;&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; when Kaz finally picked us up from the Jay Sin shoot, when we were just beginning to comb the crusts of cum from our hair in the car, and Kaz told us we were booked for an anal scene at Combat Zone in four hours. When I did not have a good attitude, when I cried from exhaustion, Kaz said, “You’ll cry when you have no money. Go to work.” And I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went even when I didn’t want to, and even when I had plenty of cash in the bank, simply because I didn’t want Kaz to get mad at me. If you have never had sex for money, it might be easy to see this as a story about coercion and consent instead of a story about work. It would have been much better if I’d been rich and could have worked only when I wanted to. It would have been much worse if I’d had no work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I was safe with Kaz. There were days when the work was uncomfortable or boring or more physically demanding than I wanted. Days when I hated my scene partner, when I held my breath and turned my face from their face. There were also days when I felt like I had made art or won a race or both. When my body moved with a kind of fluidity that felt like singing. Days when I had seven ideas in a row, mid-shoot, and my scene partner followed me or I followed them in a perfect give-and-take like we were dancing, like we were experts of movement, which we were. There were days when my scene partners were people I cared deeply about, people with whom I had shared meals and birthdays and long talks and intimacies of all kinds, whom I knew so well that a few hours into a scene, the director, the cameraman, and the production assistant just stood there, awed by the brilliant communications of our bodies. With Kaz I never had to lower my rates or acquiesce when the director tried to ask for something extra. If someone tried something on set, Kaz took care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the other porn performers who lived with Kaz were also trading sex on the side—“doing privates,” we called it. They taught me every way to do an enema and how to avoid the director when he’s trying to get you to blow him between takes and your jaw needs a rest. They told me who to put on my “no” list, who would try to cut my rate, and who would just keep me waiting all day while they got high with their friends. Many of these women were from other countries. When a man knocked on the apartment door and said “UPS,” they heard “INS,” and ran and hid in the closet. Many of them had exit plans: they were saving enough for a house or a boob job, or they were shooting to make their name so they could feature dance or increase their private rate. A few were trying to transition into mainstream film or music. Many of them were career performers whom I’d continue to work with for the next ten-plus years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro” intro&quot;&gt;During that time&lt;/span&gt; I had less and less contact with anyone who was not a sex worker. I kept my room in San Francisco but forgot how to talk to civilians. It had already been difficult, years before, when people at parties and bars tried to act cool around me by suddenly talking about sex or pornography in a way that pretended to be casual. They relied on me to respond in a way that approved of them, that made them feel edgy or in. They wanted the veneer of association without any of the consequences. Sometimes young leftist men would look at me with sad faces; they wanted to talk for an hour about whether I and the other women were all right. They wanted to know which kind of strip club it was “OK” to go to and which was the bad kind. People constantly asked for free memberships or DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when people asked me what I did and I told them, the conversation simply ended. Their faces changed and they couldn’t meet my eyes anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With strangers at the airport or the bank, I called myself a model or an independent contractor, which I’d learned to say from other sex workers. Sometimes on housing applications I pretended I had rich parents. I’d print out my bank statement, highlight the deposits, and tell the landlord my parents gave me the money. Once, when I opened a bank account and put “model” as my occupation, the teller would not let it go. Would he see me on any billboards? Had I traveled to exotic places to shoot? Did I know anyone famous? Finally, I told him, “I make pornography.” He took a beat and then said, “Well, whatever pays the bills, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard that all the time. “We’ve all got bills to pay,” or, “You’ve got to make rent somehow,” or, my favorite, “Well, we’re all whores in one way or another.” That one made me angriest. People assumed my job was terrible and then patted themselves on the back for telling me my job was less terrible than they assumed. It reminded me that my job would always, in one way or another, mark me as different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I was working with Kaz, I was making so much porn­ography that I was beginning to be recognized, which made it harder for me to imagine doing anything else. I thought a lot about what it would be like to not be a whore. I wondered whether, if I stopped, I would be allowed into what seemed to me like the glass room civilians lived in. I could see it everywhere around me, but I didn’t know how to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;By 2007, I increasingly&lt;/span&gt; felt&lt;/span&gt; the weight of public, social, and familial condemnation. I was tired from working long days and had little control over when and how I worked. I had been told so many times, in so many ways, that being a person who trades sex meant my life had no value. I was afraid it might be true. I felt both cut off from the larger world and that it’d be dangerous, physically and psychically, to try to interact with civilians. Around that time, I received an email from Shelley Lubben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubben had traded sex for a number of years in the late ’80s and early ’90s before being, in her own words, “rescued” by an evangelical man she later married (“a friend to a prostitute, just like Jesus,” she said). After leaving the industry, she devoted herself to “rescuing” other women, eventually founding the Pink Cross Foundation. Many of her claims were extreme or offensive: that God had cured her of herpes and cancer, that all women in the sex industry had been molested as children, that watching pornography would lead to bestiality. Her email, however, suggested little of that. Lubben wrote to me as though she knew me. In my memory, she said she thought I was smart, that I had potential, and that I was meant for greater things. (I’ve since learned that she wrote this to everyone.) Lubben invited me to go on an MTV reality show where she’d pay me to be publicly saved. I knew other girls who’d been “saved” by her, and they’d made testimonial videos where they cried and talked about how they’d been transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For days, I contemplated Lubben’s email. I knew how difficult it would be to go back to school or apply for non-adult jobs when I had little other work experience and little hope of hiding my years of adult film work. I was not looking for a religious conversion, but I wanted desperately to walk through the world as the kind of person civilians could see. I wanted a way to escape the weight of stigma. Lubben pretended to offer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let the days pass and didn’t respond. Later I heard stories about how Lubben let down the women she promised to support. She held fundraisers but didn’t give the funds to the women she’d claimed to be helping. Some went back to their parents, some took minimum-wage jobs. Most of them, as far as I could tell, came back to sex work eventually. A friend of mine who got saved and then came back just rolled her eyes when we talked about it. She called it her “crazy for Jesus” moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubben’s approach was representative of the rescue industry. Nicholas Kristof live-tweets brothel raids and gets paid by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; to write about it. The former police officer and pastor Kevin Brown leveraged his “rescue missions” into a reality TV show on A&amp;amp;E called &lt;em&gt;8 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, for how long he believed it would take him to “liberate” sex workers from “a life of servitude.” On the show, Brown pretended to be a client and then ambushed women with TV cameras when they arrived for work. The ambushes were staged, but the exploitation of vulnerable workers was not. In 2015, sex workers and writers Alana Massey and Bubbles described how Brown and A&amp;amp;E failed to provide the support they promised the women they’d convinced to go on the show. One of these women, Kamylla, described waiting weeks after filming until her rent was past due. She was facing final eviction notices, and she could no longer wait. She posted an ad using the same number she’d used when she was contacted by the producers of &lt;em&gt;8 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. She was subsequently arrested in a police sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescuing women from the sex trades is an old business. In San Francisco in 1910, a woman named Donaldina Cameron made it her job to join police on brothel raids to “rescue” Chinese immigrant sex workers and take them into her mission home, called Nine-twenty. At Nine-twenty, the women were made to cook and clean and sew in preparation for being good Christian wives. Staff read all incoming and outgoing mail. Many of the rescued women escaped their rescuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, the Methodist reverend Paul Smith delivered a series of sermons calling for a shutdown of the red-light district in the uptown Tenderloin neighborhood. In response, three hundred brothel workers marched to the Central Methodist church to confront him. Reverend Smith told the women they could make $10 a week working as domestics. The women told him $10 would buy a single pair of shoes. He asked how many would be willing to do housework. They said, “What woman wants to work in a kitchen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all anti-trafficking activists and organizations are part of the rescue industry. Trafficking-survivor activists like Meg Muñoz, Kate Zen, and Laura LeMoon and anti-trafficking advocates like Kate D’Adamo work to connect people to resources without coercion. They condemn the rescue industry and advocate for policies that help victims of violence without harming other people in the sex trades. The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women is an international coalition of organizations working to address exploitation by strengthening labor rights, supporting safer migration, providing social services, opposing discrimination against people in the sex trades, and explicating the failures of criminal justice approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best anti-exploitation work is being done by those of us with experience trading sex. Too often, that work looks like showing up for one another when legal and social systems utterly fail us. Kamylla described how after she was arrested, the people who finally offered her concrete support were the other women she was locked up with, who had also been arrested on prostitution charges. “They were helping me reach my family outside,” she said, “using their credits to call people who could reach my husband.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;In the decade&lt;/span&gt; or so&lt;/span&gt; since online advertising and social media have become widely available, people in the sex trades have developed online networks for sharing information about client screening and safer work methods, lists of potentially dangerous clients, and information about what kind of legislation or police stings are happening in what cities, where community meetings and rallies and protests are being held, and who has extra cash this month and who needs it. All this information has been lifesaving. Also lifesaving has been our ability to simply connect with each other, to find others with shared experiences, to talk across distances about familial and social rejection, to dream together about what love and labor and solidarity could look like in a world where trading sex makes most people view you as disposable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that sex workers do to stay safe are almost always the things civilians want to pass laws to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever community coalitions we build, whatever work we do to speak about our own lives even when it is dangerous to do so, our voices will continue to be ignored if what we’re trying to say doesn’t fit into preexisting narratives. Not only have the legal and cultural frameworks of the past two decades shaped the public meaning of our work, caricaturing us as permanent victims or as “empowered” businesswomen (and in these narratives, we are always “women”); they have shaped our ability to even point out their faulty premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the radical narrative, all sex trading is understood as trafficking and our ability to consent does not exist. In the competing liberal-libertarian narrative, those of us who have been publicly described as having “consented” to our work are categorically characterized as “empowered,” as “choice feminists.” Under these constructs, we have only two options: to be victims, which means we need to be rescued from our work—even if that rescue happens in handcuffs—or to be empowered sex workers, which means saying we’ve never experienced violence or constrained choice, that we love our jobs all day every day, and to be free we only need access to the free market. (As the activist Kaya Lin has said, “If you are a sex worker, you can’t have bad days.”) In terms of policy, these positions translate quite literally into the threat of being jailed versus the possibility of surviving using the methods we already use. The threat of further criminalization has pushed many people to publicly embrace the latter—to say, “I love doing sex work. I only want the state to leave me alone.” Often that seems like the most we could hope for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as we reach for the less terrible of two terrible ideas, we’re constantly reminded of how little say we have at all. Neither liberal feminists nor libertarians, radical feminists nor the religious right, can hear us speak in our own words. They do not want to hear us; they want to collect the scraped-bare “facts” of our lives and call them data. They want to interrogate us. Who did you work for? How young were you? Do you have papers? Do you have children? Do you have parents? Have you been to school? Do you speak English? What are your traumas? Who hurt you? Do you love it? Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love it? How much do you love it? During a recent visit I made to a law school class, a student asked me, “Is there a level of poverty at which a woman can’t consent?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again in my own life, people have demanded to know what has been done to me, how I was exploited, what kind of trauma or poverty pushed me into believing I had no other options than to trade sex. Or they have asked to hear about how trading sex has been my pathway to empowerment, to sexual adventure. They have asked me to slot my experiences neatly into one story line or another, or demanded I hand over the facts of my life so they could do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, when the California State assemblyman Isadore Hall authored a bill to mandate the use of condoms as well as state-recorded testing of performers in adult films, my coworkers and I took buses and trains up to the state capitol to testify against the bill. The elaborate, community-driven testing regimen we relied on had prevented even a single on-set transmission of HIV since 2004, and it would be seriously undermined by the proposed legislation. Perhaps worse, Hall’s bill would have created a state registry of performers’ legal names and health information. We gathered the signatures of more than six hundred performers, a thick ream of paper that I carried clutched to my chest, shielding my body from the Senate Appropriations Committee with this physical evidence of our collective will. I remember Hall testifying to the committee that he had written this bill because someone needed to be “a voice for the voiceless,” and that person would be him. I sat beside him at a podium microphone. My coworkers stood in a long line at a microphone behind him, waiting for him to stop so we could speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro” intro&quot;&gt;In 2015, Amnesty International&lt;/span&gt; circulated an internal draft policy on sex work for consideration at their International Council Meeting in Dublin that August. The draft policy called for the decriminalization of all sex work. When word of it reached the public, many Holly­wood actresses signed a letter to Amnesty International opposing the policy. The letter, written by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, framed legal sex work as “license to purchase women.” It said that “regardless of how a woman ends up in the sex trade” she suffers “lifelong physical and psychological harm.” It claimed that decriminalization would “support a system of &lt;em&gt;gender apartheid&lt;/em&gt;, in which one category of women may gain protection from sexual violence and sexual harassment . . . while another category of women . . . are instead set apart for consumption by men and for the profit of their pimps, traffickers and brothel owners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the signers didn’t say was that criminalization does the same thing. When trading sex is made illegitimate, the people who do it are also made illegitimate. Criminalization increases barriers to safety in every form—housing, health care, child care and parental rights, and familial and social support. We live, here and now, in a country in which trading sex is more criminalized than in nearly any other country on earth, and where sex workers have little legal recourse when we’re assaulted. When we’re assaulted, under criminalization, we have to weigh the possibility that going to the police will mean being arrested. If we go to the police, they can refuse to investigate our rapes. Often the police themselves are our rapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the women of Hollywood began to talk about Harvey Weinstein in 2017, I felt sick for a long time. I avoided social media. I stopped listening to the news. I went back to social media, but muted the words &lt;em&gt;rape&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;raped&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;rapist&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter. Still I saw the hashtag again and again. On the red carpet, I saw Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd talk about “an equitable and safe world for women.” They said, “We women, our voices have been squelched.” I couldn’t listen to them without a deep and swelling rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Ashley Judd writing on Twitter, “It is essential, and is not anti sex, to expose pornography’s complicit role in child abuse &amp;amp; trafficking.” I remember Mira Sorvino, UNODC Goodwill Ambassador to Combat Human Trafficking, saying that “prostitution breeds sex trafficking.” Later in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, Sorvino wrote, “I am here to encourage a mass speaking-out.” She wrote that her fear of speaking about her own experiences left her “crying and shaking,” that she woke at 2 &lt;span class=&quot;smallcap&quot;&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; and couldn’t fall back to sleep. I was extremely familiar with that fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years I didn’t tell anyone I had been raped. Besides the usual reasons, I didn’t tell anyone because I knew how sex workers’ experiences of sexual violence are rewritten by anti-sex-work feminists as &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; we work in the sex trades, whether we describe them that way or not. For years I never talked publicly about my experiences of violence and coercion while doing sex work because I knew how these stories would be weaponized. After #MeToo was co-opted from Tarana Burke, when wealthy white women like Sorvino and Judd made themselves its public face, I thought: These women encouraging a mass speaking-out are the same people making it impossible for me to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When feminists call for the criminalization and delegitimization of sex work, they do not ally themselves with sex-working women. They actively create and cultivate a world in which sex-working women are culturally, legally, and visibly separated from women who do not trade sex. They make sure that they will not be mistaken for one of us, and they do so by telling a story about our lives that is about predators and not about work. A story in which the power dynamics are utterly uncomplicated and so are the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, on a phone call with the ACLU, I was asked about labor protections for adult-film performers. I said: You have to recognize how complicated this is. The things that sex workers do to stay safe are almost always the things civilians want to pass laws to stop. Everything looks different depending on the distance from which you’re looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;“intro”&quot;&gt;In the lead-up&lt;/span&gt; to FOSTA’s&lt;/span&gt; passing into law, major websites and apps like Craigslist and Instagram began to ban sex workers from their platforms, shutting down spaces where we advertised and organized. Those of us who had done visible organizing and advocacy received numerous phone calls and requests for help. People in the sex trades had suddenly lost necessary income and were facing eviction, medical crises, and food insecurity. Workers who had been pushed offline moved to doing street-based work or went back to in-person client-seeking in bars, casinos, and clubs, where negotiation is necessarily rushed and workers face higher risks of violence from both clients and police. Many workers heard from managers who had previously harmed them, saying, You need me now. There was, and continues to be, widespread fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hearings for FOSTA, congresspeople repeatedly claimed that the bill’s passage was necessary to stop a scourge of what they called “modern-day slavery.” A report from the House Judiciary Committee in February 2018 said, “Prostitution and sex trafficking are inextricably linked, and where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery.” The following month, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) made his impassioned case before the Senate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women and children are being forced into sex slavery in modern-day America. It could very well happen to someone you know . . . . We have heard, over and over, the untold stories of the inhumanity of stacking people body-to-body in the holds of these slave ships. It finally took a civil war to settle the issue. That was slavery. That was slavery we opposed and now all of our laws try to protect against, but here in modern-day America, the same thing is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The slavery of black women is abolished in America; but the slavery of white women continues in Europe,” Victor Hugo wrote in a letter to the white British feminist Josephine Butler in 1870. The letter is frequently cited as the first time trading sex was referred to as “slavery.” Butler took the language and ran with it, writing that regulations governing legalized prostitution in 19th-century Europe were “similar to the ‘Fugitive Slave Law’ which existed in America.” She claimed that those who advocated for legalized and regulated prostitution in Europe had a “fixed determination to reduce women to a slavery more complete than any which the earth has ever seen.” Her rhetoric was taken up in the United States, where reformers who had been part of the antebellum abolitionist movement joined forces with anti-immigration activists, white feminists, religious reformers, sensationalist journalists, and congresspeople to rail against a “new,” and newly un-American, “slavery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the Black Codes and subsequent Jim Crow laws reinstituted a racialized system of forced labor that continues to this day, white Americans told themselves that the country had entered a new age of freedom that was now under threat from Chinese immigration. Chinese women who worked in gold rush–era brothels in California were, claimed one reformer, “infusing a poison into the Anglo-Saxon Blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first law limiting immigration into the United States, the Page Act of 1875, was a direct response to this rhetoric, prohibiting the “importation into the United States of women for the purposes of prostitution.” The Page Act also prohibited the entering into a contract by immigrants from China, Japan, or “any Oriental country” for “lewd and immoral purposes.” The law resulted in the exclusion of almost all Chinese women from the US, a move that the historian Jean Pfaelzer has described as ethnic cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the turn of the century, the focus of “new slavery” rhetoric had moved to the supposed enslavement of white women for the purposes of forced prostitution. The end of the 1800s had been marked by increased industrialization and movement of rural workers to urban centers, and the archetypal “white slave” of the early 1900s was a young farm girl who had been lured into prostitution after leaving her family and living alone in a boardinghouse in the city. The same time period saw the construction of race as genetic and hereditary, and fears of white women’s “enslavement” in brothels were fears of interracial sex and miscegenation. In 1909, the US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Edwin W. Sims, claimed that “white slavery” was “a system operated by a syndicate which has its ramifications from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific ocean, with ‘clearing houses’ or ‘distributing centers’ in nearly all of the larger cities.” In 1910, Congress responded by passing the White-Slave Traffic Act, also called the Mann Act, which prohibited the transportation of women and girls “in interstate or foreign commerce . . . for the purpose of prostitution of debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.” The Mann Act, which was largely responsible for the development of the FBI as a federal agency, is still very much a part of the US Code. The most substantial part of FOSTA is simply an amendment to the Mann Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rewriting of slavery as a harm to white men and women ignored the role that rape and sexual violence played in the systemic enslavement of African Americans. The rape of enslaved African American women was not, legally, a crime, and scholars like Andrea Ritchie and Angela Davis have described how rape and sexual assault were an “essential dimension,” in Davis’s words, “of the social relations between slavemaster and slave.” Also ignored in the national moral panic around “modern slavery” were the experiences of Black women working in the Progressive Era sex trades. As Cynthia Blair describes, middle-class African Americans during this time were vocally critical of the national campaign that neglected Black brothel workers. In 1920, the civil rights activist Irene McCoy Gaines remarked on the irony of a rescue campaign focused exclusively on white women, who had greater access to other forms of employment, when Black girls and women received “less protection from public opinion than from the law.” While Black women in the sex trades went unmentioned in national debates among whites, they then (as today) bore the brunt of anti-prostitution activist pressure on police, who responded by conducting raids on brothels where Black women worked, demanding bribes and protection money. By 1915, despite the recent passage of a federal law to “protect women,” Black women arrested for trading sex were given increasingly harsh penalties by municipal judges. By 1924, Blair writes, Black women “consistently composed more than half of all women arrested for working in a house of prostitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence that in 2019, both sex work and reparations are issues on the presidential campaign trail. The roots of these issues are deeply intertwined, and calling trading sex “modern slavery” only ensures that we will never reckon with the lasting impact of the institutionalized, lawful enslavement of African and African American people in the United States. Meanwhile, the racism encoded in anti-trafficking legislation and rhetoric is still alive. In November 2018, in an address on border and immigration control, President Trump said, “They steal women. The human traffickers, the lowest scum on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;I have worked for&lt;/span&gt; “art photographers” and I have worked for “pornographers.” I have worked for “college students doing a business project.” I’ve talked to men through email and I’ve talked to men on the phone. I’ve sat in a foam-stone warehouse “dungeon” to talk through a scene both before and after it happened. I’ve had conversation after conversation about what, exactly, I was willing to do with my body. In my experience, the people who call their work pornography, in addition to paying better than the “art photographers,” are more direct and clear in these conversations (something MacKinnon and Dworkin didn’t seem to consider when they carved out an exception in their ordinance for “erotica,” which they defined as “sexually explicit sex premised on equality”). In my early years of working, when I showed up at a studio, a warehouse, or an apartment and a director asked, “What do you want to do today?” I had to learn how to come up with an answer. No one in my private life had ever asked me a question like that. What we were doing, of course, was negotiating consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told that my story is unrepresentative — that anyone who does not want to be “rescued” from sex work is too much of an outlier to base policy decisions on. I’ve also been told that I’m “very articulate for someone with your experience” — that I’m too articulate and thus too privileged to be allowed to articulate myself. I’ve also been told that I’m too traumatized, or too brainwashed, to understand my own experiences. One member of the California State Assembly listened to everything I had to say and then replied, “You seem smart, but they aren’t all like you.” Let me be clear: Every sex worker I have ever met is as smart as I am; many are smarter. I have learned more, collectively, from my coworkers than from any of the formal education I’ve bought with my hard-earned sex-work dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, and especially since #MeToo, I’ve had many conversations with my coworkers about what it means to trade sex under circumstances that are coercive but not forced — circumstances under which we did things intentionally but did not &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; in the sense academic feminists usually mean. How do we describe our lives without neglecting the fact that we have experienced both violence and joy at work? How do we talk about those extremes without ignoring the pragmatic day-to-day of it all, the profound boredom of washing and folding sheets between sessions, of listening to wealthy middle-aged men boast, of surreptitiously checking our watches while fucking, of all the tasks that we are paid for that have nothing to do with sex and have so much in common with other forms of service work? How do we talk about our experiences without letting their meaning be stolen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sex worker, artist, and theorist suprihmbé said to me while we tried to find terms that fit our experiences, “We are somewhere in between.” In her essay “Defined/Definers,” she writes about “indirectly determin[ing]” to do sex work. The intention of sex-worker activists who have embraced the choice/coercion dichotomy, she writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is to draw firm lines between sex work and sex trafficking . . . to circumvent or undermine sex trafficking legislation that targets independent prostitutes and cyber prostitutes (erotic webcam models), and to stop people from stereotyping sex workers as victims who need their kind of saving. However, while doing it this way might protect sex workers who are actually sex workers by &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;, it does not protect the rest of us who fall into that murky gray area in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, instead of talking about consent, sex workers Juno Mac and Molly Smith use the term “deliberate” sex work: choosing is not the same as doing something deliberately. The migrant sex worker collective Red Canary Song, formed in the wake of Yang Song’s death during a 2017 police raid on a Queens massage parlor, describes its work as led by and for “people who are trading sexual services for income or survival needs.” The sex-work coalition Decrim NY, who this year introduced in New York state the most comprehensive decriminalization bill in the country, describes their coalition as being made up of people who have traded sex out of “choice, coercion, or circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While FOSTA may not actually do what congresspeople claim, it has made the essential conversations encouraged by people like suprihmbé, Juno Mac, Molly Smith, Red Canary Song, and Decrim NY extremely difficult to have in public. Even though FOSTA has not yet been used by attorneys or by law enforcement, the law has had tremendous influence on the actions of private companies.&lt;sup id=&quot;rf1-11649&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nplusonemag.com/issue-35/essays/cashconsent/#fn1-11649&quot; title=&quot;The DOJ has said that FOSTA actually makes it harder to prosecute websites for trafficking, and the only federal judge to rule on the law so far has said that the “promotes or facilitates” language only creates liability identical to existing liability under the federal Travel Act . The Travel Act, notably, is the law that was used to shut down Backpage.com four days before FOSTA actually passed. A few attorneys bringing civil trafficking suits have claimed that they are bringing the suits based on changes to the law made by FOSTA, but these claims, while attracting media attention, aren’t true. All suits thus far have been brought under preexisting state-level tort laws, to which FOSTA made no change in liability.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Much like the numerous “anti-trafficking” laws that create third-party liability, FOSTA incentivizes private companies to exclude people who trade sex from public spaces and accommodations. Earlier this year, Marriott admitted that their employees, having been through “anti-trafficking training,” were profiling single women and asking them to leave their hotel bars. FOSTA does the same thing online. Congress calls us voiceless and then takes away the spaces where we were speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say that moving to San Francisco saved my life, I mean that it was there that I met other people who shared my experiences of sex, desire, gender, and identity. It was there that I learned a language through which I could talk about the most difficult parts of my life. Most of the sex workers I met in San Francisco were working-class queers and trans men and women. They helped me understand that what I was doing at work was putting on a show about gender. They taught me that the implements of traditional “femininity” — rather than being, as I had heard my whole life, symbols of weakness or ways to fail at gender — were tools we could wield without having to own them. “Femininity” was a combination of things we sometimes felt innately, sometimes constructs we created to make money, and sometimes constructs we created to create ourselves. Untangling my gender from my “femininity” made my queerness a part of me that I could love. Loving my queer, poor, brilliant sex-worker friends helped me know that I was whole and unbroken — allowed me to believe that I, too, was deserving of love. Listening to them speak gave me my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2, 2018, sex workers gathered in Chicago, Las Vegas, Oakland, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix, and Washington DC for International Whores’ Day, commemorating the eight-day occupation of Saint-Nizier Church in Lyon by more than one hundred sex workers protesting criminalization and police harassment in 1975. The rally I attended in New York City was meant to take place in Christopher Park to honor the queer and trans sex workers of color who are our whore-mothers, who refused to submit to police violence at Stonewall nearly fifty years earlier, but the crowd swelled and continued to swell until we spilled into traffic. The organizers decided we should march to Washington Square. We took the streets and walked down West 4th Street chanting, brandishing our banners and signs. Four hundred of us crowded under the arch. We made speeches about our rage at years of being sacrificed by policymakers who see us as collateral damage, about our friends who had recently been evicted, attacked, jailed, and killed. We envisioned a better future, and we held each other’s grief and hope. Through call-and-response, we four hundred voiceless repeated and amplified each other’s words. We had no microphones, but we did not need them.&lt;/p&gt;
