<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this article I’ll try to explain how the Sun and the various motions of the Earth end up making our planet look like in the demonstration below. You can drag the globe around to see it from different perspectives and use the sliders to change the date and time:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to talk about Earth and Sun without referencing a few dimensions and dates. They’ll be shown in &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;imperial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;metric&lt;/span&gt; units (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;1 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;1 km&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;an American&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;an international&lt;/span&gt; date format (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;mm/dd/yyyy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;dd/mm/yyyy&lt;/span&gt;), but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;switch_units();return false;&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;the more universal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;American&lt;/span&gt; units if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time of day will be presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time&quot;&gt;Coordinated Universal Time&lt;/a&gt;, or UTC for short, which is roughly a local time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich&quot;&gt;Greenwich&lt;/a&gt; in London, UK. This time standard is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; adjusted for daylight saving time which is very convenient as it will let us look at the sunlight for the same time of day at different dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by visualizing how enormous the Sun is. In the picture below you’ll find the Earth and the Sun placed next to each other. The Earth is the tiny blue dot on the right side of the Sun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun is almost a perfect sphere with a radius of &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;432,170 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;695,700 km&lt;/span&gt;. The Earth’s shape resembles an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid&quot;&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/a&gt; with an average radius of &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;3958.8 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;6371 km&lt;/span&gt;. As such, the radius of the Sun is 109 times larger than that of the Earth. Naturally, the Sun doesn’t look that large in the sky, but that’s because the Sun is quite far away from the Earth. Before we see how far away the Sun is we first have to discuss a simple shape that is the base of all planetary orbits – an ellipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to define an ellipse, but in the context of space it’s most convenient to speak of it in terms of &lt;em&gt;focal points&lt;/em&gt;. An ellipse is a figure consisting of points for which the sum of distances to its two focal points is constant. That’s certainly a mouthful, so an interactive diagram will paint a better picture:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The small cross represents the center of an ellipse while the two white disks show its focal points. The total length of blue and red segments is the same for every point on the ellipse. The &lt;span class=&quot;es_dashed&quot;&gt;dashed&lt;/span&gt; line is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse while the &lt;span class=&quot;es_dotted&quot;&gt;dotted&lt;/span&gt; line is the semi-minor axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining property of an ellipse is the ratio between a distance &lt;span class=&quot;es_c0&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; from the center to a focal point known as &lt;em&gt;linear eccentricity&lt;/em&gt;, and a distance &lt;span class=&quot;es_c1&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; from the center to the “far point” of the ellipse i.e. the length of its semi-major axis. In the demonstration below you can adjust that ratio with a slider:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This ratio is known as &lt;em&gt;eccentricity&lt;/em&gt;. When an eccentricity is equal to 0 an ellipse becomes a perfect circle, for eccentricity of 1 an ellipse with a fixed major axis length degenerates into a linear segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have already heard that the orbit of the Earth is an ellipse and that the Sun is located in one of the focal points of that ellipse. This situation is often visualized like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The small cross in the middle shows the center of the ellipse while the small rings, one of which is directly in the center of the Sun, symbolize the focal points. There are two important points on the orbit: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_perihelion();return false;&quot;&gt;perihelion&lt;/a&gt; is the point at which Earth is closest to the Sun, while at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_aphelion();return false;&quot;&gt;aphelion&lt;/a&gt; Earth is the furthest away from the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Sun is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in one of the focal points of the ellipse, but instead the objects in the Solar System revolve around its &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/&quot;&gt;center of mass&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Sun’s mass is so dominant that the actual focal point is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter#/media/File:Solar_system_barycenter.svg&quot;&gt;fairly close&lt;/a&gt; to the Sun’s center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’ve seen above paints a convenient picture, but the actual relative sizes are very different. Below you’ll find a visualization of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun with proper scales. The tiny yellow dot in the middle depicts the Sun. At your current viewing scale the Earth is pretty much invisible, it has a diameter of &lt;span id=&quot;es_earth_diameter_pixels&quot;/&gt; pixels, so instead its location is shown by an arrow. You may also be barely able to tell that the orbit is elliptical. Its eccentricity is equal to 0.0167 and the Sun is very close to the center:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you pay a close attention to the position of the Earth at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;year_orbit_begin();return false;&quot;&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of a calendar year and compare it with the beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;year_orbit_end();return false;&quot;&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt; you’ll notice that the Earth hasn’t returned to the exact same position – during 365 days the Earth falls a little short of the full orbit. We’ll soon see that there are multiple ways to define “a day”, but unless stated otherwise we’ll assume that it lasts 24 hours, that is 24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time it takes Earth to get back to the same point on the orbit is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year&quot;&gt;sidereal year&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;em&gt;sidereal&lt;/em&gt; means “with respect to stars”. A sidereal year lasts roughly 365.256 days. A sidereal year is actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the basis of year tracking in civilian time, but we’ll have to wait until the later parts of this article to discuss &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; period of Earth’s journey around the Sun that defines how we count years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is fairly small so the distance between the center of the Sun at aphelion (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;94,509,460 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;152,098,233 km&lt;/span&gt;) is not that much larger than that at perihelion (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;91,402,640 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;147,098,291 km&lt;/span&gt;). As such, the apparent Sun size is only 3.3% smaller when the Sun is the farthest from Earth compared to when it’s closest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the enormous size differences we’re dealing with from this point on I’ll abandon the exact relative dimensions and instead use whatever size is convenient to demonstrate the discussed subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of planetary motion are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&quot;&gt;Kepler’s laws&lt;/a&gt; of which the second one describes the planet’s speed at different points on the orbit. In the demonstration below you can make the planet orbit the Sun. As Kepler has discovered, traversal of each of the arc of the pie-slice sections of the orbit takes &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; amount of time:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the bottom part of the simulation you can see the flattened length of the arc the planet sweeps within the same amount of time. When the planet is closer to the Sun it travels a much longer path, that is it moves much &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; than when it’s away from the Sun. Kepler’s second law says that the &lt;em&gt;areas&lt;/em&gt; of the triangular pieces are the same, so naturally if the height of the triangle is made longer due to a larger distance to the Sun, the base, i.e. the arc swept, has to get shorter to maintain the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the actual shape of Earth’s orbit the arc length differences are much smaller, but as we’ll discuss, they still impact some aspects of time tracking on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve been looking at the orbit from above, but a tilted perspective shows that the orbit defines an infinite flat sheet known as the orbital plane. You may drag over the demonstration up and down to change the viewing angle:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, all planets in the Solar System have very similar orbital planes which is a consequence of formation of the planets from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk&quot;&gt;protoplanetary disk&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth pointing out that the plane represents a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; – Earth wobbles slightly up and down due to changes in position of the Moon, and, to a smaller extent, of other planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we’re still not ready to discuss how a year is measured, but understanding the Earth’s revolution around the Sun will actually help us describe the duration of a day, so let’s discuss the most tangible motion of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth rotates around its axis from west to east, or, when seen from above, counter-clockwise. In the simulation below you can change the time of day by dragging the slider. The first important thing to observe is that the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane shown as a horizontal line. Currently the axis is tilted at roughly 23.437° away from the vertical:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you compare the position of the Earth &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;earth_rot_begin();return false;&quot;&gt;at the beginning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;earth_rot_end();return false;&quot;&gt;at the end&lt;/a&gt; of a 24 hour cycle you may notice something surprising – the Earth has completed slightly more than one full rotation around its axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a full 360° rotation takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and little over 4 seconds, a period known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time&quot;&gt;sidereal day&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that while the Earth is rotating around its axis, it’s also traveling along its orbit. In the demonstration below, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much not to scale, you can see how after one full rotation the point on the Earth that was pointing at the Sun no longer does so and it requires some more time for that location to face the Sun again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of all the stars in the sky the Sun is the one of paramount importance to our lives so the base measure of a day is the period after which the same point on Earth points at Sun again. To be more precise, we’re interested in the duration after which the Sun comes around to be directly above the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)&quot;&gt;meridian&lt;/a&gt; – a half a circle on the surface of the Earth connecting the poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also brings us to the concept of solar &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon&quot;&gt;noon&lt;/a&gt;, a time of day at which the Sun is located directly over some point at the local meridian. In the demonstration below that meridian is shown with a yellow color while the red dot shows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point&quot;&gt;subsolar point&lt;/a&gt; – a location on Earth that points directly towards the Sun:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Depending on one’s position on the Earth, during a local solar noon the subsolar point is either directly north, directly south, or directly at the current location. This is also where the terms AM and PM come from. In Latin &lt;em&gt;ante meridiem&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;before midday&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;post meridiem&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;after midday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon is the time of day at which the Sun is at the highest point in the sky which also means that the shadows cast by the sunlight are the shortest. Naturally, we don’t set our clocks to solar time. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone&quot;&gt;time zones&lt;/a&gt; are used to provide a more uniform timing within different regions of the world. Despite heavily &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#/media/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png&quot;&gt;irregular shapes&lt;/a&gt; the centers of the time zones correspond to roughly noon of local solar time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration between two solar noons is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time&quot;&gt;solar day&lt;/a&gt; which lasts the familiar 24 hours. However, that’s not completely accurate. If you look closely at the simulation of the sidereal and solar day you’ll notice that we didn’t account for two important factors – eccentricity of the orbit and the axial tilt of the Earth. In fact, 24 hours is the duration of a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; solar day. The actual duration of each individual day varies, but before we witness that variation we have to discuss the most important consequence of the axial tilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to look at the orbital plane from above you’d notice that the axial tilt of the Earth isn’t aligned to either the major or the minor axis of the orbit’s ellipse. In the simulation below you can observe the position of the Earth and its axis of rotation at different points of the year:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The four colored line segments mark four important points on that path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;during &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_spring&quot;&gt;March equinox&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_fall&quot;&gt;September equinox&lt;/span&gt; in the top-down view the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the direction towards the Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_summer&quot;&gt;June solstice&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_winter&quot;&gt;December solstice&lt;/span&gt; in the top-down view the axis of rotation is parallel to the direction towards the Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, at different times of year either the Northern or the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun which is clearly visible when we look at the orbital plane from a side with the point of September equinox pointing &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; at us:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The change in tilt relative to the Sun causes the familiar cycle of seasons. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_june_solstice();return false;&quot;&gt;June solstice&lt;/a&gt; marks the time at which the Northern Hemisphere is maximally exposed to the Sun and the summer begins, however, at the same time the Southern Hemisphere is facing away from the Sun and in that part of the world the winter begins. The situation flips during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_december_solstice();return false;&quot;&gt;December solstice&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_equinox();return false;&quot;&gt;equinoxes&lt;/a&gt; both hemispheres are equally exposed, the day and night last roughly 12 hours which gives the event its name – in Latin &lt;em&gt;aequus nox&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;equal night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the seasons in practice, let’s look at the Earth from the Sun’s perspective. The horizontal line shows the orbital plane:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice, that during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_summer();return false;&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; on the Northern Hemisphere no matter what time of day it is the Sun never “sees” Antarctica – the Sun never rises there. Conversely, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_winter();return false;&quot;&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; on the Northern Hemisphere the Sun always sees that continent and so the Sun doesn’t set during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being directly exposed to sunlight is only a part of the seasonal picture. Despite constant exposure to Sun during summer on the Southern Hemisphere Antarctica is still a very cold place. It’s the direction at which the sunrays hit the ground that determines the amount of power the surface is exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the demonstration below I marked three bands on the surface of the Earth – each one occupies 36° of latitude. The thin lines symbolize sunrays hitting the Earth. By changing the date you can observe how the percentage of all the rays approaching the planet is distributed among those bands:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The more perpendicular to the rays the surface is, the more energy it receives – the factor scales with a cosine of the angle between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)&quot;&gt;surface normal&lt;/a&gt; and the direction of the incoming light. During summer months the Northern Hemisphere receives a much higher percentage of incoming rays compared to winter months which explains the average temperature difference between the two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s also interesting to see the sunlight from a reference frame fixed onto Earth. You can drag around to spin the globe freely in space. Yet again the red dot shows a location of the subsolar point:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What may be a little surprising is that at a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; time of day the point on Earth that points directly towards the Sun is quite wobbly when the date changes – it not only moves in north-south direction, but also in east-west direction. This effect is visible more clearly on a world map with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection&quot;&gt;equirectangular projection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When seen from Earth this figure 8 shape is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma&quot;&gt;analemma&lt;/a&gt;. In the following demonstration you can see the position of the Sun in the sky as seen at &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;12:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;12:00&lt;/span&gt; UTC from the Greenwich area in London. I chose this location since its mean solar time is pretty much the same as UTC time. The vertical lines represent angle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth&quot;&gt;azimuth&lt;/a&gt;. The one corresponding to 180° is located directly &lt;em&gt;south&lt;/em&gt; of the observer. The horizontal lines show angles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system&quot;&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; – the angle above the horizon. In the bottom right corner you can see which part of the sky is the observer located at the black dot looking at:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Sun may seem tiny, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter&quot;&gt;angular diameter&lt;/a&gt; is only 0.53°, while the entire analemma spans 2 × 23.437° = 46.874° in the vertical direction. The Sun isn’t always at its highest point in the sky at &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;12:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;12:00&lt;/span&gt; local mean solar time, sometimes it’s a bit ahead of time and sometimes it’s late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Apparent_solar_time&quot;&gt;apparent solar time&lt;/a&gt; and the “expected” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time&quot;&gt;mean solar time&lt;/a&gt; is described by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time&quot;&gt;equation of time&lt;/a&gt;. The two primary causes for the drift is eccentricity of the orbit, which by Kepler’s second law causes variation in the Earth’s orbital speed, and the axial tilt which causes difference of speed of the subsolar point in “around the Earth” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small daily differences accumulate to fairly big numbers – the Sun can be late by up to 14 minutes and ahead of schedule by up to 16 minutes against it’s clock-expected position. However, across the entire year the duration of a day averages out to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally have a grasp of how “a day” is measured and how important the Sun is in that picture. Moreover, the position of Sun relative to the Earth also plays a critical role for defining a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall our discussion of the axial tilt you may have assumed that while the direction of the axial tilt isn’t aligned to either major or minor axis of the orbital ellipse it is otherwise static. However, this is not actually the case. The axis itself slowly rotates, when seen from above, in a clockwise direction. In the demonstration below you can see how the direction changes over time. A top down view of the orbit is placed in the bottom right corner:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This effect is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession&quot;&gt;axial precession&lt;/a&gt; and is caused by gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon. It takes about 25,772 years for the revolution to complete. Over time the precession will cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris&quot;&gt;Polaris&lt;/a&gt; to no longer be the north star as the Earth’s axis will point at some other direction in the starry sky. In a few thousand years it will be spring instead of winter that will begin on the Northern Hemisphere around the time of perihelion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the effect is very slow it has an impact on time tracking on Earth. In the exaggerated simulation below you can see how the precession causes the point of March equinox to change. In the bottom right corner you can observe the arc that the axis traverses in this period:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thick outline of the almost complete circle shows the path of Earth between two March equinoxes. This period defines a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year&quot;&gt;tropical year&lt;/a&gt; which, because of the precession, is &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; than a sidereal year – it lasts roughly 365.2422 days. Given the importance of stable occurrence of the cycle of seasons in the calendar it’s this period that is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; foundation of year tracking on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration of a tropical year is non integral and after 4 years of 365 days we’re almost a full day away from the actual place on the orbit at which the March equinox occurs. A solution to this problem are leap years which in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar&quot;&gt;Julian calendar&lt;/a&gt; occurred every four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is a little too much of a correction – simply observing a leap year every four years makes a year last 365.25 days on average. Over the centuries the date undershoot was measurable in days and to resolve the situation the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar&quot;&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1582 which, other than skipping over 10 days, added some extra caveats to the simple four-year rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years divisible by 100 are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; leap years, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; they’re also divisible by 400 – the year 2000 was a leap year, but the year 2100 won’t be. This causes a year in the Gregorian calendar to on average last 365.2425 days which is a much closer match to the duration of a tropical year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of axial precession was a hint that many of the parameters of the Earth’s motion that may seem static are in fact anything but — everything about the positioning of the Earth changes as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The angle of the axial tilt varies between 22.1° and 24.5°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eccentricity of the orbit varies between almost 0.0 and 0.0679 with multiple overlapping cycles of different periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elliptical orbit itself also rotates – an effect known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession&quot;&gt;apsidal precession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles&quot;&gt;cycles&lt;/a&gt; have different periods, but they all contribute to the very complex nature of the journey of the Earth through the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual a lot of great educational videos can be found on YouTube. Vsauce’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJhgZBn-LHg&quot;&gt;How Earth Moves&lt;/a&gt; covers many of the same topics I’ve discussed in a more entertaining way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82p-DYgGFjI&quot;&gt;Earth’s motion around the Sun, not as simple as I thought&lt;/a&gt; by Aryan Navabi has good visuals and goes into more details of a long term cyclical nature of Earth’s motions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a beautiful explanation of why planets have elliptical orbits I recommend 3Blue1Brown’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xdIjYBtnvZU&quot;&gt;Feynman’s Lost Lecture&lt;/a&gt;. The video is based on a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Feynmans-Lost-Lecture-David-Goodstein-ebook/dp/B002WQLN6U&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by the same title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Strobel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronomynotes.com/&quot;&gt;Astronomy Notes&lt;/a&gt; provide a good overview of many topics that I haven’t covered in a form of lecture notes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astrosurf.com/luxorion/analemma.htm&quot;&gt;The Solar Analemma&lt;/a&gt; by Anthony Ayiomamitis is a five page story about difficulties of capturing analemma on a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional book form &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/celestial-calculations&quot;&gt;Celestial Calculations&lt;/a&gt; by J. L. Lawrence is a great introduction to planetary motions. The book successfully bridges the gap between pop-science overviews of the space and the math-heavy advanced reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it captivating that two seemingly separate concepts of a day and a year, driven by two different motions of Earth, are ultimately connected by the Sun and the interaction of its light with our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit#Definitions&quot;&gt;modern definition&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; describing the flow of time in terms of the position of the Sun in the sky may seem archaic, but up until the middle of 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century a second was simply defined as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;86400&lt;/sub&gt; of a mean solar day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve since let go of that dependence, but the present day measure is just a much finer and &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; more stable expression of pretty much the same duration. One day we’ll colonize other planets, those planets will have different suns, orbits, and rotations periods, yet a simple second will forever be tied to Earth and Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Coffee Is Hard</title>
<link>https://www.stilldrinking.org/coffee-is-hard</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.stilldrinking.org/coffee-is-hard</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/coffee-is-hard.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in the 80s, some people had a dream of combining the cutesy graphics of 80s visual games and the soul-crushing difficulty of 80s text adventures. And so Sierra On-Line created quest games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quest games started with a premise like “escape the wizard” or “escape the aliens” then forced you to do a series of banal and random tasks to avoid the many, many ways to die. Once you know the way, most of the games can be completed in under an hour. On the first go, it took my whole family weeks. Not the least of the horror was often having to do things several scenes before there’s any reason for having done them: in &lt;em&gt;Space Quest I&lt;/em&gt;, the hero-janitor Roger has to refuse the first offer for his bike, so the guy will come back a little later and throw in a jetpack. Of course there’s no indication that he’ll come back with a jetpack, and no reason to think there’s a need for a jetpack until three days later when Roger exits his spaceship and floats into the void because he doesn’t have a jetpack. This leads to replaying most of the game a dozen times just looking for a jetpack, which is hidden not in a spaceship closet or a bar or a cavern, but behind a tough-but-not-too-tough bargaining strategy. It also took about ninety seconds to switch between screens, so exploration was grueling on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most treasured memories are agonies that won’t get out of the mind and have to get turned into a character-building story to maintain sanity, so I searched hard for a modern port of these games and immediately inflicted them on my girlfriend. We got through the first two &lt;em&gt;Space Quests&lt;/em&gt; in a few hours since I remembered about three quarters of the traps. We haven’t finished the third one. I think there’s a secret code in the credits of a game about chickens. Haven’t floated into the void yet; I assume we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing the first two, I realized I’d been programming for 17 years and could probably make my own, especially when all the art is 320 pixels wide and that’s about how many pixels I can work with before people give me a sideways look and ask if I really have a liberal arts degree. I decided to base the story loosely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Noware-Peter-Welch-ebook/dp/B077TZRNLD/&quot;&gt;my novel&lt;/a&gt;, for two reasons: first, if the game happens to get the kind of notoriety my novel has not, I might be able to boost sales by claiming the novel can serve as a hint book. Second, I spent nineteen years writing that stupid book, and this seemed like a good a way to manage the withdrawal symptoms. Three weeks later I’d built a rendering engine I’m quite proud of, a simple command and scene logic processor, and accidentally reinvented GIF compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The was only one thing left to do: come up with ways to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was an attempt to marry the arbitrary cruelty of the original quest games to the self-destructive lifestyle of the disaffected and depressed characters in my book. Jacob wakes up on the floor. If he tries to stand up immediately, he stumbles and breaks his head open on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/headdesk.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs more sleep, but if he tries to go back to sleep, he can’t because he’s having a nicotine craving. If he searches, he can find matches to light his last cigarette. Then he can go to sleep, but if he doesn’t put out the cigarette first, the apartment burns down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/burned.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dead again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he smokes, puts the cigarette out, and sleeps, he can successfully stand up. As long as he doesn’t try to turn on the computer, he can even make it out of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling confident, I decided to force the player to make a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have big plans for death in this game. I’m importing some void and sorcerer deaths directly from the old quests. In the middle of plot, Jacob’s consciousness is transplanted into a ham sandwich, and you have to eat this ham sandwich in the first scene so Jacob’s future sandwich-self reintegrates with his past-self and the game can continue. Otherwise ham-Jacob just rots away in a dark refrigerator. If you don’t put on a raincoat in the beginning, Jacob gets pneumonia and develops an increasingly irritating cough until he drops dead at the beginning of the last scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cruel and obnoxious as this is, it’s simple to program. The hardest part of writing “if rain and not raincoat: jacob.pneumonia = true” is spelling pneumonia. I only have to draw the coughing animation once, and collapsing dead to the ground from pneumonia is just a minor variation on all the other collapses dead I’ve already drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not even going to directly kill Jacob for not having a cup of coffee. I won’t let him put on the raincoat before making it because I didn’t want to do raincoat variations of all the coffee-making mini animations. I had to rewrite parts of the rendering engine to make coffee. There are thirteen lines of code that do nothing but determine what to say when you look at the coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
'LOOK AT COFFEE MAKER': () =&amp;gt; {
  if( State.scene.state.coffeedrunk ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has done its job and mercifully drained the
            last life out of the old and savaged grounds.&quot;
  } else if( State.scene.state.brewed ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has a fresh pot of what is likely coffee in it.&quot; 
  } else if( State.scene.state.brewing ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker is brewing.&quot;
  } else if( State.scene.state.waterinmaker ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has fresh water in it, and is ready to brew
            a terrible cup of coffee.&quot;
  } else {
    return &quot;Makes coffee. Whodathunk? There's no water in it, and you don't
            have any fresh coffee, but the grounds already in there have
            only been used twice and can't be THAT moldy.&quot;
  }
}

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the coffee maker have water in it? Does the pot have water in it? Does Jacob have the pot? Is Jacob close enough to the coffee maker to take the pot? Is the water on? Is he close enough to sink to turn water on? Has he poured the water into the coffee maker? Is it finished brewing? These are all conditions that have to be checked and met. I’ve written more code to make coffee than I generally do to write a login form. Coding coffee is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since turning twenty-three, I’ve had a coffee-making subroutine in my brain. Writing code to get a forty-pixel character to make it made me think about the ways that subroutine has failed me. Sometimes I don’t pour the water into the coffee maker and end up with a pot of warm water. Sometimes I don’t put grounds into the maker, which also results in a pot of warm water and is indistinguishable from not pouring the water into the maker. Sometimes I forget to close the lid and the coffee maker pours water back into the well until it all evaporates. I have to trust this subroutine because I haven’t had coffee yet, but it only takes one of many potential neurological hiccups to get an error with no log report. It’s not computer code’s fault that making coffee with it is a pain; it’s inherently a pain to make a cup of coffee. I didn’t even get to the cup: I made Jacob drink it right out of the pot to save myself a few steps, and it’s still two hundred lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coding death and coffee, this seems right. Avoiding premature death is a process of not occupying the same space as fast-moving metal or motivated microbes. Living is mostly a series of repetitive and unrelated tasks. It makes sense that the most tedious things to code are the tedious things that just have to be done. There are no life lessons or gymnastic skills involved in doing dishes, there’s no underlying theory of housework that will reveal itself after a thousand vacuum cleanings. Making coffee is a boring sequence of steps people feel stupid for getting wrong, even though they’re statistically doomed to screw it up now and then. The hard parts of of life are driving to work, eating properly, flossing, and medicating my disease-ridden yet fucking immortal cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t fought any aliens or terrorists, but I can relate to putting on the right outfit to survive another day in a way I can’t relate to being a bullet-resistant sniper. Sierra’s quest games traced the shape of mundane death, at once leaving out the tedious bits, and elevating simple tasks by giving them purpose in an eventually comprehensible chain of cause and effect. They even offered some decent life strategies: look at everything, pick up anything you can, avoid wizards, and always haggle for jetpacks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Four kinds of documentation</title>
<link>https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote text-left&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon icon-quote&quot;/&gt; There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are: &lt;em&gt;tutorials&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;how-to guides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;technical reference.&lt;/em&gt; They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most software documentation - often immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd prefer to watch a video covering this topic, here is it (courtesy of PyCon Australia 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/t4vKPhjcMZg&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;50&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because &lt;strong&gt;if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if for some reason they have to use it because they have no choice, without good documentation, they won’t use it effectively or the way you’d like them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone understands this. Nearly everyone knows that that they need good documentation, and &lt;strong&gt;most people try to create good documentation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;most people fail&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, it’s not because they don’t try hard enough. Usually, it’s because they are not doing it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will explain how you can make your documentation better, not by working harder at it, but by doing it the right way. &lt;strong&gt;The right way is the easier way&lt;/strong&gt; - easier to write, and easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some very simple principles that govern documentation that are very rarely if ever spelled out. They seem to be a secret, though they shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can put these principles into practice, it will make your documentation better and your project, product or team more successful - that’s a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The secret&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation needs to include and be structured around its &lt;strong&gt;four different functions:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;tutorials&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;how-to guides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;technical reference.&lt;/em&gt; Each of them &lt;strong&gt;requires a distinct mode of writing&lt;/strong&gt;. People working with software need these four different kinds of documentation at different times, in different circumstances - so software usually needs them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And documentation needs to be explicitly structured around them, and they all must be kept separate and distinct from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col col-12 col-lg-6&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tutorials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;learning-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows the newcomer to get started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is a lesson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col col-12 col-lg-6&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How-to guides&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A how-to guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;goal-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows how to solve a specific problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is a series of steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col col-12 col-lg-6&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;understanding-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides background and context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogy: an article on culinary social history&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col col-12 col-lg-6&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reference&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reference guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;information-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describes the machinery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is accurate and complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogy: a reference encyclopaedia article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This division makes it obvious to both author and reader what information goes where. It tells the author &lt;em&gt;how to write&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;what to write&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;where to write it&lt;/em&gt;. It saves the author from wasting a great deal of time trying to wrestle the information they want to impart into a shape that makes sense, because &lt;strong&gt;each of these kinds of documentation has only one job&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s extremely hard to maintain good documentation that doesn’t implicitly or explicitly recognise the quadrants of this scheme. The demands of each kind are different from those of the others, so &lt;strong&gt;any attempt at documentation that fails to maintain this structure suffers&lt;/strong&gt;, as it’s pulled in different directions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the structure, it becomes a very useful tool for analysing existing documentation, and understanding what needs to be done to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Project documentation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may well ask: where do things like changelogs, contribution policies, and other information about the project fit into this scheme? The answer is that they do not - because they are, strictly speaking, &lt;em&gt;project documentation&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;documentation of the software itself&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can simply be kept in appropriately-named sections alongside the other material - as long as they are not mixed up &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let's explore each of the four key functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tutorials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorials are &lt;em&gt;lessons&lt;/em&gt; that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are wholly &lt;strong&gt;learning-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;, and specifically, they are oriented towards &lt;em&gt;learning how&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;learning that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are the teacher&lt;/strong&gt;, and you are &lt;strong&gt;responsible&lt;/strong&gt; for what the student will do. Under &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; instruction, the student will execute a series of actions to achieve some &lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end and the actions are up to you, but deciding what they should be can be hard work. The end has to be &lt;em&gt;meaningful&lt;/em&gt;, but also &lt;em&gt;achievable&lt;/em&gt; for a complete beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consider an analogy of teaching a child to cook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; you teach the child to cook isn’t really important. What’s important is that the child finds it enjoyable, and gains confidence, and wants to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through&lt;/em&gt; the things the child does, it will learn important things about cooking. It will learn what it is like to be in the kitchen, to use the utensils, to handle the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because &lt;strong&gt;using software, like cooking, is a matter of &lt;em&gt;craft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s knowledge - but it is &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, not &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; knowledge. When we learn a new craft or skill, we always begin learning it by doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that having done the tutorial, the learner is in a position to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the software itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most software projects have really bad - or non-existent - tutorials. Tutorials are what will turn your learners into users. &lt;strong&gt;A bad or missing tutorial will prevent your project from acquiring new users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good tutorials are very difficult to write. They need to be useful for the beginner, easy to follow, meaningful and extremely robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to write good tutorials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ALLOW THE USER TO LEARN BY DOING&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning, we only learn anything by doing&lt;/strong&gt; - it’s how we learn to talk, or walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your software tutorial, your learner needs to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things. The different things that they do while following your tutorial need to cover a wide range of tools and operations, building up from the simplest ones at the start to more complex ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;GET THE USER STARTED&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly acceptable if your beginner’s first steps are hand-held baby steps. It’s also perfectly acceptable if what you get the beginner to do is not the way an experienced person would, or even if it’s not the ‘correct’ way - a tutorial for beginners is not the same thing as a manual for best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of a tutorial is to get your learner &lt;strong&gt;started on their journey&lt;/strong&gt;, not to get them to a final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TUTORIAL WORKS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of your jobs as a tutor is to inspire the beginner’s confidence: in the software, in the tutorial, in the tutor and, of course, in their own ability to achieve what’s being asked of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that contribute to this. A friendly tone helps, as does consistent use of language, and a logical progression through the material. &lt;strong&gt;But the single most important thing is that what you ask the beginner to do &lt;em&gt;must work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The learner needs to see that the actions you ask them to take have the effect you say they will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the learner's actions produce an error or unexpected results, your tutorial has failed - even if it’s not your fault. When your students are there with you, you can rescue them; if they’re reading your documentation on their own you can’t - so you have to prevent that from happening in advance. This is without doubt easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ENSURE THE USER SEES RESULTS IMMEDIATELY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything the learner does should accomplish something comprehensible, however small.&lt;/strong&gt; If your student has to do strange and incomprehensible things for two pages before they even see a result, that’s much too long. The effect of every action should be visible and evident as soon as possible, and the connection to the action should be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of each section of a tutorial, or the tutorial as a whole, must be a meaningful accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MAKE YOUR TUTORIAL REPEATABLE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your tutorial must be reliably repeatable.&lt;/strong&gt; This not easy to achieve: people will be coming to it with different operating systems, levels of experience and tools. What’s more, any software or resources they use are quite likely themselves to change in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial has to work for all of them, every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorials unfortunately need regular and detailed testing to make sure that they still work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;FOCUS ON CONCRETE STEPS, NOT ABSTRACT CONCEPTS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tutorials need to be &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, built around specific, particular actions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temptation to introduce abstraction is huge; it is after all how most computing derives its power. But all learning proceeds from the &lt;em&gt;particular and concrete&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;general and abstract&lt;/em&gt;, and asking the learner to appreciate levels of abstraction before they have even had a chance to grasp the concrete is poor teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PROVIDE THE MINIMUM NECESSARY EXPLANATION&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t explain anything the learner doesn’t need to know in order to complete the tutorial.&lt;/strong&gt; Extended discussion is important - just not in a tutorial. In a tutorial, it is an obstruction and a distraction. Only the bare minimum is appropriate. Instead, link to explanations elsewhere in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;FOCUS ONLY ON THE STEPS THE USER NEEDS TO TAKE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your tutorial needs to be focused on the task in hand.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the command you’re introducing has many other options, or maybe there are different ways to access a certain API. It doesn’t matter: right now, your learner does not need to know about those in order to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How-to guides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: &lt;em&gt;how to create a web form&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;how to plot a three-dimensional data-set&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;how to enable LDAP authentication&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are wholly &lt;strong&gt;goal-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you'd like an analogy, think about a recipe, for preparing something to eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recipe has a clear, defined end. It addresses a specific question. It shows someone - who can be assumed to have some basic knowledge already - how to achieve something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How-to guides are quite distinct from tutorials. A how-to guide is an answer to a question that a true beginner might not even be able to formulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a how-to guide, you can assume some knowledge and understanding. You can assume that the user already knows how to do basic things and use basic tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How-to guides in software documentation tend to be done fairly well. They’re also fun and easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to write good how-to guides&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PROVIDE A SERIES OF STEPS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How-to guides must contain a list of steps, that need to be followed in order&lt;/strong&gt; (just like tutorials to). You don’t have to start at the very beginning, just at a reasonable starting point. How-to guides should be reliable, but they don’t need to have the cast-iron repeatability of a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;FOCUS ON RESULTS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How-to guides must focus on achieving a practical goal&lt;/strong&gt;. Anything else is a distraction. As in tutorials, detailed explanations are out of place here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;SOLVE A PROBLEM&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A how-to guide must address a specific question or problem&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How do I …?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one way in which how-to guides are distinct from tutorials: when it comes to a how-to guide, the reader can be assumed to know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they should achieve, but don’t yet know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; - whereas in the tutorial, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for deciding what things the reader needs to know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DON’T EXPLAIN CONCEPTS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A how-to guide should not explain things.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not the place for discussions of that kind; they will simply get in the way of the action. If explanations are important, link to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ALLOW FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A how-to guide should allow for slightly different ways of doing the same thing.&lt;/strong&gt; It needs just enough flexibility in it that the user can see how it will apply to slightly different examples from the one you describe, or understand how to adapt it to a slightly different system or configuration from the one you’re assuming. Don’t be so specific that the guide is useless for anything except the exact purpose you have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LEAVE THINGS OUT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical usability is more valuable than completeness.&lt;/strong&gt; Tutorials need to be complete, end-to-end guides; how-to guides do not. They can start and end where it seems appropriate to you. They don’t need to mention everything that there is to mention either, just because it is related to the topic. A bloated how-to guide doesn’t help the user get speedily to their solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;NAME THEM WELL&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The title of a how-to document should tell the user exactly what it does.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;How to create a class-based view&lt;/em&gt; is a good title. &lt;em&gt;Creating a class-based view&lt;/em&gt; or worse, &lt;em&gt;Class-based views&lt;/em&gt;, are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reference guides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference guides are &lt;em&gt;technical descriptions of the machinery&lt;/em&gt; and how to operate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference material is &lt;strong&gt;information-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means technical reference can contain examples to illustrate usage, but it should not attempt to explain basic concepts, or how to achieve achieve common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference material should be &lt;strong&gt;austere and to the point&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The culinary analogy might be an ecyclopaedia article about an ingredient&lt;/em&gt;, describing its provenance, its behaviour, its chemical constituents, how it can be cooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that description &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; include basic description of how to use the machinery - how to instantiate a particular class, or invoke a certain method, for example, or precautions that must be taken when passing something to a function. However this is simply part of its function as technical reference, and emphatically &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to be confused with a how-to guide - &lt;em&gt;describing correct usage of software&lt;/em&gt; (technical reference) is not the same as &lt;em&gt;showing how to use it to achieve a certain end&lt;/em&gt; (how-to documentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some developers, reference guides are the only kind of documentation they can imagine. They already understand their software, they know how to use it. All they can imagine that other people might need is technical information about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference material tends to be written well. It can even - to some extent - be generated automatically, but this is never sufficient on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to write good reference documentation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;STRUCTURE THE DOCUMENTATION AROUND THE CODE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give reference documentation the same structure as the codebase&lt;/strong&gt;, so that the user can navigate both the code and the documentation for it at the same time. This will also help the maintainers see where reference documentation is missing or needs to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BE CONSISTENT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In reference guides, structure, tone, format must all be consistent&lt;/strong&gt; - as consistent as those of an encyclopaedia or dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DO NOTHING BUT DESCRIBE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only job of technical reference is to describe&lt;/strong&gt;, as clearly and completely as possible. Anything else (explanation, discussion, instruction, speculation, opinion) is not only a distraction, but will make it harder to use and maintain. Provide examples to illustrate the description when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the temptation to use reference material to instruct in how to achieve things, beyond the basic scope of using the software, and don’t allow explanations of concepts or discussions of topics to develop. Instead, link to how-to guides, explanation and introductory tutorials as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BE ACCURATE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These descriptions must be accurate&lt;/strong&gt; and kept up-todate. Any discrepancy between the machinery and your description of it will inevitably lead a user astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanation, or discussions, &lt;em&gt;clarify and illuminate a particular topic&lt;/em&gt;. They &lt;em&gt;broaden&lt;/em&gt; the documentation’s coverage of a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;understanding-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations can equally well be described as &lt;em&gt;discussions&lt;/em&gt;. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of documentation is rarely explicitly created, and instead, snippets of explanation are scattered amongst other sections. Sometimes, the section exists, but has a name such as &lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Other notes&lt;/em&gt; and doesn't really do justice to the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions are less easy to create than it might seem - things that are straightforward to explain when you have the starting-point of someone’s question are less easy when you have a blank page and and have to write down something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic isn’t defined by a specific task you want to achieve, like a how-to guide, or what you want the user to learn, like a tutorial. It’s not defined by a piece of the machinery, like reference material. It’s defined by what &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; think is a reasonable area to try to cover at one time, so the division of topics for discussion can sometimes be a little arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to write good explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PROVIDE CONTEXT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanations are the place for background and context&lt;/strong&gt; - for example, an &lt;em&gt;Web forms and how they are handled in Django&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Search and django CMS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can also explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things are so - design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES AND OPINIONS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation can consider alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;, or multiple different approaches to the same question. For example, in an article on Django deployment, it would be appropriate to consider and evaluate different web server options,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt; - for example, whether test modules should be in a package directory, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DON’T INSTRUCT, OR PROVIDE TECHNICAL REFERENCE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical describe. These functions of documentation are already taken care of in other sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why isn't this obvious?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure is clear, and it works, but there is a reason why it's not so obvious, and that is the way the characteristics of each quadrant of the documentation overlap with those of its neighbours in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://divioag2017-live-e9fe0b8244c24280878375-8ae4759.divio-media.net/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/2f/b9/2fb95dd1-94be-4ad6-8180-7162ed6d5ecc/what_nobody_tells_you_about_documentation_extract_3001.png__1920x1080_q90_subsampling-2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tutorials and how-to guides&lt;/em&gt; are similar because they are both concerned with &lt;strong&gt;describing practical steps&lt;/strong&gt;, while what &lt;em&gt;how-to guides&lt;/em&gt; share with &lt;em&gt;technical reference&lt;/em&gt;is that they’re &lt;strong&gt;what we need when we are actually at work, coding&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Reference guides&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; are similar because they’re concerned with &lt;strong&gt;theoretical knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, and finally, what &lt;em&gt;tutorials&lt;/em&gt; have in common with &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; is that they &lt;strong&gt;are most useful when we are studying&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than actually working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Most useful when we’re studying&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Most useful when we’re working&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Practical steps&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tutorials&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How-to guides&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Theoretical knowledge&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explanation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reference&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these overlaps, it's not surprising that the different kinds of documentation become confused and mixed in with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it's rare to find it clear examples of it used fully, a great deal of documentation recognises, in different ways, each of these four functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some projects do adopt it fully, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/#how-the-documentation-is-organized&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/&quot;&gt;this wasn't made explicit in earlier versions&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.django-cms.org/en/release-3.4.x/&quot;&gt;django CMS&lt;/a&gt;. It has proved its worth in both projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About the analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of documentation in this article is based on several years of experience writing and maintaining documentation, and much time spent considering how to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also based on sound principles that come from a variety of disciplines. For example, its conception of tutorials has a pedagogical basis; it posits a tutor and a learner, and considers using software to be a craft in which abstract understanding of general principles follows from concrete steps that deal with particulars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making documentation work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest headaches that documentation maintainers have to deal with is not having a clear picture of what they should be doing. They write and rewrite, but find it hard to make it fit together in satisfactory ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure resolves those questions by making clear distinctions and separations. They make documentation that is easier to write and maintain, that’s easier to use and to find one's way around in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation doesn’t write itself - but it’s now possible to write it without &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt;having to wrestle with poor fit, or unclear scope or doubt about what should be included or what style to adopt. It becomes much clearer &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to write, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to write it, and &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; to put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It serves users better, because for all the different phases in the cycle of their interaction with the software they will find the right kind of documentation, that serves the needs of that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing documentation that explicitly and distinctly addresses each of the four quadrants helps the software attract and keep more users, who will use it more effectively - and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is one of the things the creators of software want most of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About the Divio Expert series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.divio.com/en/company/about/&quot;&gt;Our experts&lt;/a&gt; really do deserve the name. Between them they have decades of Django development experience; the depth and breadth of the expertise we are able able to offer is world-class. They include core developers of Django, django CMS and other notable projects, and the architects of very large systems such as the Divio Cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Divio Expert weblog series aims to share some of this expertise. For updates on new articles, follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/divio&quot;&gt;our Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, or subscribe to our (very low volume) newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Favourite Git Commit</title>
<link>https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I like Git commit messages. Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime. I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commit is from my time at the Government Digital Service, working on GOV.UK. It’s from a developer by the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dancarley&quot;&gt;Dan Carley&lt;/a&gt;, and it has the rather unassuming name of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46&quot;&gt;Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fatbusinessman.com/assets/the-carley-commit.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick aside: one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/&quot;&gt;the benefits of coding in the open&lt;/a&gt;, as practised at GDS, is that it’s possible to share examples like this outside the organisation that produced them. I’m not sure who first introduced that idea to GDS – it was well-established by the time I joined – but I’m forever grateful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-like-this-commit&quot;&gt;Why I like this commit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve shared this as an example of what commit messages can do. It’s fun because of the ratio of commit message to code change, but that’s not why I think it’s worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a different organisation, from a different developer, this entire commit message might have been &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;change whitespace&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fix bug&lt;/code&gt;, or (depending on the team’s culture) some less than flattering opinions about the inventor of the non-breaking space. Instead, Dan took the time to craft a really useful commit message for the benefit of those around him. I’d like to step through a few of the ways I think this is a really good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-explains-the-reason-for-the-change&quot;&gt;It explains the reason for the change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best commit messages I’ve seen don’t just explain &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; they’ve changed: they explain &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;. In this instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;I introduced some tests in a feature branch to match the contents of
`/etc/nginx/router_routes.conf`. They worked fine when run with `bundle exec
rake spec` or `bundle exec rspec modules/router/spec`. But when run as
`bundle exec rake` each should block failed with:

    ArgumentError:
      invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this level of detail, we could hazard a guess that this commit fixed some kind of parsing error in some tool or other. Thanks to the commit message, we know exactly which tool it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of information can be really valuable to document, and is all too easy to lose as people forget the original context behind their work, move on to other teams, and eventually leave the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-searchable&quot;&gt;It’s searchable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things in this commit message is the error message that inspired the change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ArgumentError:
  invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else who comes across this error can search through the codebase, either by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git log --grep &quot;invalid byte sequence&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/search?q=%22invalid+byte+sequence%22&amp;amp;type=Commits&quot;&gt;using GitHub’s commit search&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, from the looks of the search results, multiple people did so, and found out who had found this problem before, when they came across it, and what they did about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-tells-a-story&quot;&gt;It tells a story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commit message goes into a lot of detail about what the problem looked like, what the process of investigating it looked like, and what the process of fixing it looked like. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;I eventually found that removing the `.with_content(//)` matchers made the
errors go away. That there weren't any weird characters in the spec file. And
that it could be reproduced by requiring Puppet in the same interpreter
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the areas commit messages can really shine, because they’re documenting the change itself, rather than documenting a particular file, or function, or line of code. This makes them a great place to document this kind of extra information about the journey the codebase has taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-makes-everyone-a-little-smarter&quot;&gt;It makes everyone a little smarter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Dan did here that I really appreciate was to document the commands he ran at each stage. This can be a great lightweight way to spread knowledge around a team. By reading this commit message, someone can learn quite a few useful tips about the Unix toolset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;they can pass an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-exec&lt;/code&gt; argument into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to run a command against each file found&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that adding a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\+&lt;/code&gt; onto the end of this command does something interesting (it passes many filenames into a single &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; command, rather than running the command once per file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file --mime&lt;/code&gt; can tell them the MIME type of a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who reviews this change can learn these things. Anyone who finds this commit later can learn these things. Over enough time and enough commits, this can become a really powerful multiplier for a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-builds-compassion-and-trust&quot;&gt;It builds compassion and trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Now the tests work! One hour of my life I won't get back..
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last paragraph adds an extra bit of human context. Reading these words, it’s hard not to feel just a little bit of Dan’s frustration at having to spend an hour tracking down a sneaky bug, and satisfaction at fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a similar message attached to a short-term hack, or a piece of prototype code that made its way into production and set down roots (as pieces of prototype code love to do). A commit message like this makes it much easier to remember that every change has a human on the other end of it, making the best decision they could given the information they had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-commits-matter&quot;&gt;Good commits matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit this is an extreme example, and I wouldn’t expect all commits (especially ones of this size) to have this level of detail. Still, I think it’s an excellent example of explaining the context behind a change, of helping others to learn, and of contributing to the team’s collective mental model of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning a bit more about the benefits of good commit messages, and some of the tools that make it easier to structure your changes around them, I can recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>My favourite Git commit</og:title>
<og:description>I like Git commit messages. Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime. I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit.</og:description>

<title>Bazel 1.0</title>
<link>https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/10/bazel-reaches-10-milestone.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/10/bazel-reaches-10-milestone.html</guid>
<description>We're excited to announce the first General Availability release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bazel.build/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; build system designed to support a wide variety of programming languages and platforms.&lt;div&gt;Bazel was born of Google's own needs for highly scalable builds. When we &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/09/building-build-system-bazel-reaches-beta.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open sourced Bazel back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, we hoped that Bazel could fulfill similar needs in the software development industry. A growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/wiki/Bazel-Users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;list of Bazel users&lt;/a&gt; attests to the widespread demand for scalable, reproducible, and multi-lingual builds. Bazel helps Google be more open too: several large Google open source projects, such as Angular and TensorFlow, use Bazel. Users have reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://databricks.com/blog/2019/07/23/fast-parallel-testing-at-databricks-with-bazel.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3x test time reductions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://redfin.engineering/we-switched-from-maven-to-bazel-and-builds-got-10x-faster-b265a7845854&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10x faster&lt;/a&gt; build speeds after switching to Bazel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mTkJ3VugOag/XagxCdh-o3I/AAAAAAAAASs/yterGtOE7KEpHRjU8rkWuEmbf9YTDIWSACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-17%2Bat%2B11.14.29%2BAM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;622&quot; data-original-width=&quot;618&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mTkJ3VugOag/XagxCdh-o3I/AAAAAAAAASs/yterGtOE7KEpHRjU8rkWuEmbf9YTDIWSACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-17%2Bat%2B11.14.29%2BAM.png&quot; width=&quot;317&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With the 1.0 release we’re continuing to implement Bazel's &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-vision.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bazel builds are &lt;strong&gt;fast and correct.&lt;/strong&gt; Every build and test run is incremental, on your developers’ machines and on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CI&lt;/a&gt; test system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bazel supports &lt;strong&gt;multi-language&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;multi-platform&lt;/strong&gt; builds and tests. You can run a single command to build and test your entire source tree, no matter which combination of languages and platforms you target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bazel provides a &lt;strong&gt;uniform extension language&lt;/strong&gt;, Starlark, to define builds for any language or platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bazel works across &lt;strong&gt;all major development platforms&lt;/strong&gt; (Linux, macOS, and Windows).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bazel allows your builds t&lt;strong&gt;o scale&lt;/strong&gt;—it connects to distributed remote execution and caching services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The key features of the 1.0 GA release are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with Bazel 1.0, we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/06/Bazel-Semantic-Versioning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt; for all Bazel releases. For example, all 1.x releases will be backwards-compatible with Bazel 1.0. We will have a window of at least three months between major (breaking) releases. We'll continue to publish minor releases of Bazel every month, cutting from GitHub HEAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Support (LTS) releases give users confidence that the Bazel team has the capacity and the process to quickly and safely deliver fixes for critical bugs, including vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-rounded features for Angular, Android, Java, and C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new features include end-to-end support for remote execution and caching, and support for standard package managers and third-party dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;New to Bazel? Try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bazel.build/versions/1.0.0/getting-started.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for your favorite language to get started.&lt;p&gt;With the 1.0 release we still have many exciting developments ahead of us. Follow our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bazel.build/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bazelbuild&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; for regular updates. Feel free to contact us with questions or feedback on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, submit feature requests (and report bugs) in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, and join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.bazel.build/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, join us at the largest-ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.withgoogle.com/bazelcon-2019/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BazelCon&lt;/a&gt; conference in December 2019 for an opportunity to meet other Bazel users and the Bazel team at Google, see demos and tech talks, and learn more about fast, correct, and large-scale builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we wouldn't have gotten here without the continued trust, support, encouragement, and feedback from the community of Bazel users and contributors. Heartfelt thanks to all of you from the Bazel team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Dmitry Lomov, Bazel Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Gridsome – A Vue.js static site generator</title>
<link>https://gridsome.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gridsome.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;feature__inner&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Easy, local development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build websites with modern tools like&lt;br class=&quot;hide-for-small&quot;/&gt;
Vue.js, GraphQL &amp;amp; all the power of Node.js &amp;amp; the JavaScript ecosystem. Develop locally and get instant &lt;strong&gt;hot-reloading&lt;/strong&gt; for any code change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.93579766537&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;feature__inner&quot; readability=&quot;11.439688715953&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fast by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gridsome builds ultra performance into every page by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gridsome.org/docs/fast-by-default/#the-prpl-pattern&quot;&gt;PRPL pattern&lt;/a&gt;. You get &lt;strong&gt;code splitting, asset optimization, progressive images, and link prefetching&lt;/strong&gt; out of the box. Gridsome sites get almost perfect page speed scores by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;feature__inner&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PWA-ready&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gridsome generates static PWAs. Only critical HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get loaded first. The next pages are then prefetched so users can click around incredibly fast without page reloads, even when offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.183486238532&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;feature__inner&quot; readability=&quot;10.394495412844&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build on the JAMstack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of the web is JavaScript, APIs, and Markup - &lt;a href=&quot;https://gridsome.org/docs/jamstack/&quot;&gt;the JAMstack&lt;/a&gt;. Gridsome uses the power of blazing fast static site generation, JavaScript and APIs to create stunning modern web experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;feature__inner&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple, safe deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No servers. No databases. Only files.&lt;/strong&gt; Deploy your entire site to a CDN and forget about it. A Gridsome site can handle thousands to millions of hits without breaking - and no expensive server costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most dairy cows in America, which are descended from just two bulls, this cow at Pennsylvania State University has a different ancestor: She is the daughter of a bull that lived decades ago, called University of Minnesota Cuthbert. The bull's frozen semen was preserved by the U.S. Agriculture Department. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Dan Charles/NPR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Dan Charles/NPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad Dechow, a geneticist at Pennsylvania State University who studies dairy cows, is explaining how all of America's cows ended up so similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brings up a website on his computer. &quot;This is the company Select Sires,&quot; he says. It's one of just a few companies in the United States that sells semen from bulls for the purpose of artificially inseminating dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechow chooses the lineup of Holstein bulls. This is the breed that dominates the dairy business. They're the black-and-white animals that give a lot of milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dairy farmers can go to this online catalog and pick a bull, and the company will ship doses of semen to impregnate their cows. &quot;There's one bull — we figure he has well over a quarter-million daughters,&quot; Dechow says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies rank their bulls based on how much milk their daughters have produced. Dechow picks one from the top of the list, a bull named Frazzled. &quot;His daughters are predicted to produce 2,150 pounds more milk than daughters of the average bull,&quot; he says, reading from the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers like to buy semen from top-ranked bulls, and the companies keep breeding even better bulls, mating their top performers with the most productive cows. &quot;They keep selecting the same families over and over again,&quot; Dechow says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Dechow and some of his colleagues at Penn State made a discovery that shocked a lot of people. All the Holstein bulls that farmers were using could trace their lineage back to one of just two male ancestors. &quot;Everything goes back to two bulls born in the 1950s and 1960s,&quot; he says. &quot;Their names were Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation and Pawnee Farm Arlinda Chief.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean that the bulls in the catalog are genetically identical. They still had lots of different mothers, as well as grandmothers. But it does show that this system of large-scale artificial insemination, with farmers repeatedly picking top-rated bulls, has made cows more genetically similar. Meanwhile, genetic traits that existed in Holstein cows a generation ago have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've lost genetic variation,&quot; Dechow says. &quot;Now, some of that variation was garbage that we didn't want to begin with. But some of it was valuable stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what might have been lost, Dechow decided to do an experiment. He located some old semen from other bulls that were alive decades ago, with names like University of Minnesota Cuthbert and Zimmerman All-Star Pilot. You might call them heirloom bulls. The U.S. Agriculture Department keeps samples of their semen in deep-freeze storage in Fort Collins, Colo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechow used that semen to impregnate some modern cows. They gave birth, and now it's possible to see some lost pieces of the Holstein family tree come to life in a barn at Penn State — in the form of three cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechow leads the way to the barn. He points toward a cow that eyes us suspiciously. &quot;Here is our old genetic lineage, [cow] number 2869,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye, this cow looks pretty much like all the others. But Dechow sees things that others can't. &quot;If you notice, if you look over her back — see how that cow to her left is a little more bony?&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Dechow points it out, the difference is plain to see. &quot;So she definitely carries more body condition. She's a little bit fatter,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, dairy farmers didn't like cows with extra body fat. They thought the ideal cow was a skinny one, because she was turning all her feed into milk, not fat. So farmers chose bulls that tended to produce that kind of daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've kind of selected for tall, thin, cows,&quot; Dechow says. &quot;And that's a really bad combination. They're infertile, unhealthy. So we need to get away from that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechow thinks the frozen semen from those long-forgotten heirloom bulls can bring back valuable genes that went missing — maybe genes that would allow cows to thrive in warmer temperatures, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, though, farmers actually have to use those bulls, and they'll only do so if they're persuaded that the daughters will also produce lots of milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dechow is carefully monitoring his experimental cows. So far, he says, it's going pretty well. Two of the three cows are producing at least as much milk as the industry average.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>The drive to make more milk has had an unsavory side effect: Cows have become more genetically similar and less fertile. Scientists are trying to recover valuable genetic variation that was lost.</og:description>

<title>I Survived the “Destroying Angel” (2006)</title>
<link>http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/11/22/i-survived-the-destroying-angel/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/11/22/i-survived-the-destroying-angel/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;author-byline&quot;&gt;This memoir of a near-fatal mushroom poisoning was written by our most fortunate guest, Richard Eshelman. Happy Thanksgiving, all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I. That Fateful day – July 18th, 2006&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, July 18th, 2006.&lt;/em&gt; It was a balmy day in Ithaca, New York. I went for a walk after work to sit and meditate at my favorite spot near a waterfall in Upper &lt;a href=&quot;http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=25&quot;&gt;Buttermilk State Park&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really nice to have such a huge backyard cared for by the public like Upper Buttermilk. I feel privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left my private meditation area I did a standing STARS (Somatics Transformation and Restorative Systems) exercise called “Aligning the Three Tan Tiens.” Something inside me made me feel invincible. You know that feeling you have when you are young and feel invincible? Well, as I walked out of the wooded area I was in, I found some young mushrooms. Their caps were hanging down like closed umbrellas. I mistook them for inky caps (&lt;em&gt;Coprinus&lt;/em&gt; spp.) even though I spotted an &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; nearby–its cap was fully open, and not hanging down. Thinking back, I should have been more suspicious as mushrooms do grow in colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/files/2006/11/abisporigerabutton1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; id=&quot;image69&quot; title=&quot;A young destroying angel&quot; alt=&quot;A young destroying angel&quot; name=&quot;image69&quot; /&gt;I took three home with me. I couldn’t find my Mushroom book, was in a hurry, so I trusted my judgment, fried them up in olive oil, and ate them as a side dish. I should have recognized then that they weren’t inky caps, because inky caps exude a black substance when you fry them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They honestly did not taste that good, rather bland in my opinion. I thought to myself, “Gee, I don’t think I’ll ever pick and eat these again.” (Little did I know the truth of my thought at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went dancing afterward, and bragged to my friends that I had picked and eaten some wild mushrooms for dinner. A friend asked me “Were they all white?”&lt;br /&gt;I said “Yes.”&lt;br /&gt;She scolded me, saying, “My mother told me never to eat an all white mushroom.”&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I got concerned. I covered it up by saying, “I’m OK, I know what I’m doing and I don’t feel sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got home. I was hungry, so I ate some nachos and humus and drank some apple juice before going to bed around 11 p.m. I still felt fine, so I wasn’t worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crack of dawn that time of year is early, sometime between 4:30 and 5:00. It’s a really neat time if you’ve never experienced it–the silence is almost unbearable. To most busy people it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; unbearable. There is nothing to drown out the chatter in the head. City folks usually find it uncomfortable in contrast to the noise of the city. I’ve become accustomed to awakening with the light. This morning I woke a little earlier than usual. I couldn’t quite tell whether it was still night or just breaking into the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt queasy. It was the same feeling I had when I had food poisoning. Before I had any more time to assess my state, I realized I needed to get to the bathroom. I barely made it to the royal throne when I started heaving my guts out. The vomiting reflex was strong. The pressure of the strong contractions forced stuff out both ends of the GI tract, uncontrollably. I had a severe case of vomiting and diarrhea. At that point, deep down I knew I had made the big mistake: I HAD EATEN &lt;em&gt;AMANITA VIROSA&lt;/em&gt;, AKA, “THE DESTROYING ANGEL”. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/files/2006/11/amanitarichard1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; id=&quot;image70&quot; title=&quot;The destroying angel Richard brought to the hospital&quot; alt=&quot;The destroying angel Richard brought to the hospital&quot; name=&quot;image70&quot; /&gt;For the next three hours, I was making trips constantly from my bed to the bathroom. I was still in denial. My housemate asked me the first time I was up “Are you OK?” I said “Yes, I was just sick.” By the time 7:30 had rolled around, I had talked to my girlfriend, called in sick to work and still had not mentioned that I thought it was &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; poisoning. Finally, my housemate again asked me what was going on. I responded saying “I think I accidentally poisoned myself with some bad mushrooms last night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said “Maybe you should go get checked out at the local “Convenient Care Center.”&lt;br /&gt;I silently thought to myself, “Yeah, If I go there, I’ll be sitting and waiting and by the time someones sees me, I’ll be dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my mushroom book and looked up the symptoms for Amanita poisoning: vomiting and diarrhea or severe constipation 6-8 hrs after consumption.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Oh, and by the way, it’s now destroying your liver and 50 to 80 percent of the people who ingest &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; DO NOT SURVIVE! At that point, I knew I was in deep, deep doo doo and in for the biggest fight of my life, &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the Poison Control Center – 800-222-1222.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested I go back to the area where I had picked the mushrooms and get one to take with me for identification, then get myself to the local emergency room. I went back to the area and picked the one mushroom I had left because I thought it was &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt;. I also took a piece of stem I had thrown into the garbage the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, as long as I didn’t eat or drink anything I could get around. I had pretty much eliminated everything from my GI tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in my car to drive myself to the emergency room. Three thoughts went through my head as I prepared to leave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should I go back into the house and say goodbye to my cats? My response: “No you idiot, you don’t have time for that!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I didn’t have health insurance, would I go to the emergency room knowing I was just about to wipe out my cash reserve? Luckily I didn’t have to ponder that question as I had insurance and felt very fortunate. But what about someone who didn’t? Would they deny their symptoms and just consider it food poisoning? What would have been the end result? They probably would just start to feel better and then keel over from liver failure. &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; will fool you that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My last thought was “Take one last look around you, because you may never be back here again.” I did, and left without telling anyone where I was going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;II. The Emergency Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, July 19th.&lt;/em&gt; I arrived at the ER of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cayugamed.org/&quot;&gt;Cayuga Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; about 9:15 a.m. I went in and walked straight up to the receptionist. She was on the phone with someone. She obviously was in a discussion with someone about some problem and it wasn’t going to be anytime soon that she could get off the phone. I waited patiently thinking, “I don’t want to make a scene.” Nevertheless, I didn’t understand why she couldn’t put the person on hold while she addressed a new emergency room client.Finally, around 9:30, she got off the phone and asked “What can I do for you?” I explained to her that I felt I had accidentally poisoned myself with some poisonous mushrooms. She asked whether my records were at the hospital. I said “yes.” She checked my name and found I indeed was registered and my insurance information was current. She asked me to be seated and informed me that someone would be with me shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected that someone would be out to see me within a minute or so since I had informed them that I suspected mushroom poisoning. Instead, time dragged on. I kept thinking, just stay calm and collected. Finally, after waiting another 20 minutes, someone came to get me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing to me. Most people when they know they are dying think of what they didn’t do or what they should have done. In this case, all I could do was watch and monitor time like a hawk. My concern was I needed help NOW! ASAP! But, I also knew I needed to stay calm so as not to create a panic situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember much once I was admitted other than them taking vital signs and getting the info they needed regarding the poisoning and making sure that I was the only one involved. They kept me comfortable while someone took the mushroom to Cornell for identification. They started an IV to replenish my fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting, I finally took the time to write down some phone numbers for people to call in case I didn’t make it. I also made a few more trips to the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emergency room staff came back saying a Cornell Mycologist (Kathie Hodge) had identified it. It was definitely &lt;em&gt;Amanita virosa&lt;/em&gt; mushroom poisoning.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing they did was make me drink a milk shake size container of charcoal. Have you ever seen a charcoal drink? It is as black as you can imagine. I often practice the Bates “palming” eye improvement exercise. During this exercise you rub your palms together, then place them over your eyes, and imagine the blackest black you can imagine. This was the blackest black I had ever seen! It was really hard to get past the thought and just drink it. It had a chalky flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a half hour later. The ER staff informed me they had called Bang’s Ambulance and they were present, waiting to transport me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stronghealth.com/&quot;&gt;Strong Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the charcoal drink did not stay down long. It would be at least another half hour before we left because I had to first go to the restroom to honor the vomiting reflex. My body was still reacting to anything put into my stomach and was rejecting the charcoal drink. It’s probably a good thing I made the ambulance crew wait and went to the bathroom when I did or I would have been upchucking in the ambulance all the way to Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, I also made a few phone calls; to work, letting them know what was going on and that I probably wasn’t going to be available to work the weekend, to my housemate, and to my girlfriend Julie. Then I was strapped in a gurney, loaded in the ambulance and on my to Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip to Rochester from Ithaca was uneventful. The attending ambulance technician comforted me all the way. What I do remember the most was watching the clock above the rear doors. We left Ithaca around 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon and arrived at Strong Memorial in Rochester around 5:37 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was being sent to Strong Memorial because they had the only liver transplant unit in upstate New York. The treatment of choice is often liver transplantation. With early diagnosis, another experimental treatment includes massive doses of penicillin to stimulate the liver’s defenses. This was the treatment I would receive with the option to transplant if my liver failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III. Strong Memorial Hospital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon our arrival at the Emergency Room, I was surprised to find they were ready to accept me without any paperwork. All the information about me had already been transmitted to them and I was admitted directly to the Emergency Room.The ER room there is impressive. It has a semicircular console area facing individual double occupancy booths. I was in the first one upon entering the ER room. I called Julie on my cell to let her know what had happened. She wanted to come up then, but, I insisted she wait till the next day. She insisted on letting my family know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having blood drawn every 2 hours to monitor the buildup of toxins in my liver and kidneys. They hooked me up to a transfusion stand and monitors. They were preparing to run me through all the tests they needed in order to prepare me for a transplant in case my liver failed. They were giving me huge dose of penicillin plus fluids to rehydrate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being sick as a dog with constant vomiting and diarrhea is no fun! I had a diaper on. I felt helpless. I felt humbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given a bed in the transplant unit. Taken for x-rays. Back to the room. Given a drink in order to do a CAT scan. It was a liter of pink liquid. I drank it in small amounts and even though they had given me something to shut down the vomiting, it just wasn’t working. Shortly after getting it all down, it came right back up. They gave me another liter. Again, I slowly started sipping an 8 oz glass every 15-20 minutes. Eventually, I almost got it all down and felt I could not drink another glass without vomiting again. They wheeled me down to the CAT scan machine and transferred me onto the bed that slides into the large instrument. As they started to roll me in, I yelled “Back me out, back me out! I’m going to throw up again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pulled me out of the cylinder and got me a bedpan just in time. I’m glad I didn’t ruin their large instrument puking inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the CAT scan, I was taken back to my room in the transplant unit. There was a constant droning sound that I couldn’t figure out and constant announcements over the PA system. It was really difficult sleeping with the noise and being awakened all the time for blood work. (They were drawing blood every 4 hours to monitor my liver and kidneys). It’s not a place conducive to good sleep. I just couldn’t get a decent nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend Julie and my housemate Mark visited the next day. Julie had sent out an email to the dance community informing them of my situation, and had let my family know of my happenstance. Everyone was praying for me. My sister even had a bus load of kids praying for me while on their way to a youth conference in Colorado. All were worried about me. The focus was on me. I felt embarrassed. I had made a critical error in judgment and everyone knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eileen, my friend who had first alerted me to my possible dilemma, saw the email and discussed it with her friends. One of them had just read about an alternative treatment. She went home at lunch and brought it to Eileen, who faxed it to the Doctors in Rochester. The doctors say they never received it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses Lipoic Acid.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; It has also been shown to be useful in the treatment of liver problems such as hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholagitis. The article is from Dr Whitaker’s health newsletter Vol.16, No.7, p6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now the doctors were coming around asking me questions in order to assess my mental capacity. If my liver went into failure, I would not be lucid. Without sleep, I found it hard to remember what day it was as everything seemed to blend into one long event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chess.cornell.edu/&quot;&gt;accelerator&lt;/a&gt; operator in high energy physics and am an avid amateur dancer, a certified massage therapist and Hanna Somatic Educator. When they asked me about this and I told them, they thought I had lost my sanity. They had to ask Julie and Mark if I was telling them the truth. How many people do you know that earn their living as an accelerator operator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point a doctor came in and asked me “What is Pi?” I wasn’t quite sure how to respond as I didn’t know if he was asking about Pi, or pie. My question to him was “Which pi/pie, pi the mathematical term or pie the thing you eat?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response, “Pi the mathematical term.” I proceeded to tell him about its relationship to a circle and its origins. I stumbled a little and thought maybe I really was losing my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, Julie was with me most of the day. I was taken for tests of my cardiovascular system. The stress test. They had to do it chemically as I was unable to do it physically on the treadmill. A friend from my mediation group visited, who ironically worked with the wife of the transplant surgeon, Dr. Peter Abt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday evening they took me into intensive care. Before wheeling me into intensive care, Dr Abt visited me. I had to sign papers giving Julie power of attorney etc. He informed me they were ready to give me a transplant if I needed it. I remember grabbing the cross on my neck chain and praying silently to myself, “Dear Lord, let me keep my liver. I do not want to live with someone else’s liver the rest of my life and have to deal with the medical expenses to keep my body from rejecting it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had put my fate in the hands of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_23&quot;&gt;23rd psalm&lt;/a&gt; was running through my mind as well. The Sunday morning meditation group I attend had just recited it the previous Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought that these guys might be trying to get my liver for someone else did cross my mind. I let it go. Instead, I did a visualization exercise. I imagined my liver. I saw the color black (it should have been green). My kidneys, ocean blue. I smiled to both of them. (For more info on visualization, I recommend you read “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Healing-Light-Mantak-Chia/dp/0935621466&quot;&gt;Awaken the Healing Light of the Tao&lt;/a&gt;” by Mantak and Maneewan Chia.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, in the middle of the night my liver numbers peaked and started coming down. I wasn’t out of the woods yet, but it looked like I was going to recover without a liver transplant. I was wheeled back to my room in the liver transplant unit Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of my family visited that day: Jim, my oldest brother, Tim and his wife Kim, and my baby sister Betty Sue. They brought flowers and balloons wishing me well and a happy birthday balloon as my birthday was coming up. We all held hands and my sister in law, Kim, prayed for my recovery. I was also receiving prayers and get well wishes from the dance community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All along, I had hoped to be out of the hospital by Friday to work my weekend shift. All along, the doctors told me I was going to be there for a while. It was clear I wasn’t getting out Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My liver and kidneys had taken a big insult, as had my gastrointestinal tract. Although my liver numbers were coming down, the kidney numbers still hadn’t peaked. I would be in the hospital another week to make sure I would not need kidney dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took the tube out of my nose going to my stomach on Friday. It had been quite annoying as it gave me the hiccups. I could almost predict when the next one would come along. It was that periodic. Even after removing the tube, the hiccups lingered for another couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday, all the tubes in me had been removed. Julie was there for me as well. She got me out of bed that evening and we took a short walk around the nurses’ station. We did a little salsa together. I was dancing again! The nurses applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still found it hard to sleep. Now, at least, they were only drawing blood every 4 hours. That night another patient was in my room who was there to receive a transplant. He was constantly yelling out for help from the nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday night/Monday morning I finally fell into a deep dream sleep. I saw a white church glistening in white light. A power cord glowing red was feeding power to keep it lit up. I was riding in a black limo and sparks flew from behind the car as we drove over the power cord. The next thing I knew, I was next to my grandfather’s grave. I was wondering why I was there when I was awakened by the nurse for another blood sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask me whether I had any near-death experiences, I usually relay my dream to them. I am here by the grace of God! I feel so lucky and yet fortunate. I found out that of three people admitted in 2006 to Strong Memorial with &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; poisoning, I am the only one to have survived; 66% died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I live and the rest not live?&lt;br /&gt;Was it the amount of toxin?&lt;br /&gt;Was it that I knew what had happened to me and sought care and help quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Was it my meditation/visualization and somatic self care/self help practice?&lt;br /&gt;Was it the prayers of my friends and family and my faith?&lt;br /&gt;Was it the doctors’ care? One of them said it was a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply said, I don’t know that it was any individual thing, but a combination of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday, July 24th was my birthday. I could not have received a better gift than the gift of life. Throughout my life, I have been traumatized. I was born a blue baby, fell out of a silo at the age of 12, etc. I could go on, but the important thing is, I am a survivor. I love cats–maybe I have nine lives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I get in such a mess? In retrospect, I considered the possibility that I had subconsciously poisoned myself. But in reality, the mistake I made was just &lt;strong&gt;not taking the time to positively identify the mushrooms I had picked before ingesting them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot; readability=&quot;60.503427592117&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most victims of life-threatening mushroom poisoning in North America are people from Southeast Asia; Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam. They apparently mistake &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; for edible “Paddy-Straw” (&lt;em&gt;Volvariella volvacea&lt;/em&gt;) mushrooms. The two are similar in several ways; cap color, size, and the white “cup” around the base of the stalk, but different in others (for example, the Paddy-Straw has a pink spore print, the &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt;*, a white spore print; and the &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt;* has a partial veil). The Paddy Straw mushroom occurs in tropical and temperate areas worldwide, and is especially common in Southeast Asia; the &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt;, alas, does not occur in Southeast Asia, so folks from that part of the world are unaware of the lethal “look-alike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of North Americans pick and eat wild mushrooms every year, without as much as a belly ache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they “experts?” Yes! At least, they are experts on the edible wild mushrooms they know. Either their parents or grandparents taught them how to identify morels, or puffballs, or meadow mushrooms, or they have a good field guide and they read it… or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one with a reasonable understanding of the importance of properly identifying mushrooms – with a serious awareness that some species are fatally toxic – falls victim to the Destroying Angel*. The folks who eat Destroying Angel* do not use field guides: they just pick the damned things and eat them. No trip to the library. No reading. No spore prints. No idea what a “partial veil” is or what “gill attachment” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… Is it really dangerous to eat wild mushrooms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How dangerous is it to drive a car? If you’re drunk or careless, it is VERY dangerous; if you’re sensible and pay attention, it is reasonably safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Would you pick and eat an unfamiliar berry simply because it “looked good?” Of course not. Finding, identifying, preparing, and eating wild mushrooms can be a delightful pastime–IF it is done intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it is a terrible “accident” waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;* I took the liberty of changing the name from deathcap to destroying angel or &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; in the text above. It’s worth noting that &lt;em&gt;Amanita phalloides&lt;/em&gt; most closely resembles the paddy-straw mushroom; &lt;em&gt;A. virosa&lt;/em&gt; less so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Excerpted with permission from David Fischer’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanmushrooms.com/deathcap.htm&quot;&gt;American Mushrooms.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another week after leaving of the hospital before I felt comfortable eating and not being close to a bathroom. I was back to work within two weeks of being released from the hospital. A month later, I was pretty much back to full strength. My liver numbers normalized early, pretty much by the time I had left the hospital. It would be another month and a half before my kidney numbers normalized.The liver is a remarkable organ. It is the only organ that can regenerate itself. The kidneys are a different story. There is probably some permanent damage there but not sufficient to require any long term care. People often donate and live with just one kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have some strange thoughts during my recovery at home. I’m assuming they were just lingering effects of the toxins in my system. In general, I’ve made a complete recovery and expect no long term effects. I am grateful to be alive and feel very lucky. I’m also grateful for my training in Hanna Somatic Education. It felt great to get back home and in the routine of practicing my somatic exercises, exploring, and able to be comfortable in my body again. It was like coming home to my body as well. I encourage everyone to get a copy of Thomas Hanna’s book: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Somatics-Reawakening-Control-Movement-Flexibility/dp/0738209570&quot;&gt;Somatics: Reawakening the Mind’s Control of Movement, Flexibility, and Health&lt;/a&gt;” or to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hannasomatics.com&quot;&gt;Hanna Somatics website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ref&quot; readability=&quot;10.406377759608&quot;&gt;A Special Thanks to Kathie Hodge for encouraging me to write this.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editor’s Note: &lt;em&gt;Amanita virosa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amanita bisporigera&lt;/em&gt; are treated as two separate species by most mycologists, but their appearance and effects are quite similar, and the names have sometimes been used interchangeably. The Editor follows the authoritative example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/mainaman.html&quot;&gt;Rod Tulloss and Zhu-liang Yang&lt;/a&gt; in treating northeastern North American destroying angels as &lt;em&gt;Amanita bisporigera&lt;/em&gt;, whereas &lt;em&gt;Amanita virosa&lt;/em&gt; is a strictly European species. There is some satisfaction in this, since &lt;em&gt;A. bisporigera&lt;/em&gt; was described from the Ithaca area exactly 100 years ago by my predecessor at Cornell, George F. Atkinson. This is a centennial poisoning!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editor’s Note: For more on Amanita toxicity and recognition please see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/?p=58&quot;&gt;Destroying Angels&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editor’s Note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid&quot;&gt;Alpha-lipoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, also known as thioctic acid, was advocated for treatment of &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; poisoning in the 1950s and 1960s, but subsequent studies failed to find a therapeutic effect, according to D.R. Benjamin (1995, Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas. W.H. Freeman).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos: K.T. Hodge (young &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt;), and K.E. Loeffler (the mature &lt;em&gt;Amanita&lt;/em&gt; that Richard brought with him to the hospital for identification).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zappos 2012 data breach settlement</title>
<link>http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#a10</link>

<description>&lt;li readability=&quot;11.954887218045&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Case About?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case relates to a hack on defendant Zappos.com LLC’s (formerly known as Zappos.com, Inc.) (“Defendant” or “Zappos”) data security systems in January 2012. The case alleges that Zappos’s data security practices on and prior to January 15, 2012, exposed consumers to a heightened risk of identity theft, fraud or other harm, and further alleges that these risks were not properly disclosed to consumers. The case also alleges that Zappos customers suffered inconvenience, harm and increased risk as a result. Zappos denies all wrongdoing in the matter, denies that any valuable data was stolen, and denies that any consumer was harmed by the hack. Nonetheless, Zappos has agreed to the settlement described here, without admitting any fault in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;10.921241050119&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Class Action?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a class action, one or more people called class representatives (in this case Theresa D. Stevens, Denise Relethford, Emily E. Braxton, Stephanie Preira (also known as Stephanie Huppert), Robert Ree, Patti Hasner, Dahlia Habashy (also known as Dahlia Bonzagni), Katharine Vorhoff and Shari Simon (collectively, “Class Representatives”)) sue on behalf of people who have similar claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.9462365591398&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I a Settlement Class Member?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a Settlement Class Member if, on or before January 15, 2012, you had an online account with Zappos, and Zappos had an email address for your account in its records at that time. Both individuals and legal entities can be Class Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.9739884393064&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is There a Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to a settlement to avoid the uncertainty and cost of litigation, and to provide benefits to Class Members more promptly. The Court did not decide in favor of the Class Representatives or Zappos. Zappos denies any liability or wrongdoing of any kind associated with the claims in this class action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7.7865429234339&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can I Get From the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may use the discount code emailed to you to receive 10% off a single future online purchase on Zappos.com or via the Zappos.com mobile app of goods (exclusive of shipping costs and taxes). Your discount code cannot be used to purchase gift cards or on previous purchases. &lt;span&gt;Your discount code is valid immediately.&lt;/span&gt; You also may transfer this discount code to someone else for individual, non-commercial use. Discount codes expire December 31, 2019, but if the settlement is not approved by the Court, they may expire sooner. If you are unable to use your discount code immediately due to hospitalization or military service, you may request a substitute code by sending an email to &lt;span&gt;2012action@zappos.com&lt;/span&gt;. Discount codes have no cash value, and other terms and conditions of use are explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/media/2391587/settlement_agreement_and_release.pdf&quot;&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;116.21499416569&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Am I Giving Up to Get Settlement Benefits or Stay In the Settlement Class?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you exclude yourself, as described below, you will remain in the Settlement Class and be bound by the terms of the settlement and all of the Court’s orders. This means that you can’t sue or be part of any other lawsuit against Defendant or related parties (including Amazon.com) about the January 2012 data security hack or any other issues in this case. Staying in the Settlement Class also means that you agree to the release of the following claims, including any unknown claims, as set forth in greater detail in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/media/2391587/settlement_agreement_and_release.pdf&quot;&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release of the Settlement Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any and all rights, duties, obligations, claims, actions, causes of action or liabilities, whether known or unknown, including, without limitation, claims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, public disclosure of private facts, violations of Cal. Bus. &amp;amp; Prof. Code § 17200 et seq., Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.29 &amp;amp; 1798.80, Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq., Fla. Stat. Ann. § 501.204(1) et seq., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, M.C.P.L.A. §§ 445.903(1)(c), 445.903(1)(e), 445.903(1)(s) &amp;amp; 445.903(1)(cc), Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 598.0903, 598,0915(5), 598.0915(15) &amp;amp; 598.0923(2), N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 349, 598.0915(5) &amp;amp; 598.0915(7), Tex. Bus. &amp;amp; Com. Code §§ 17.46(a), 17.46(b)(5), 17.46(b)(7) &amp;amp; 17.50(a)(3) and unjust enrichment, whether arising under local, state or federal law, whether by Constitution, statute, contract, rule, regulation, any regulatory promulgation (including, without limitation, any opinion or declaratory ruling), common law or equity, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, foreseen or unforeseen, actual or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, punitive or compensatory concerning the Released Parties’ conduct, policies, or practices, arising from, related to, connected with, or described in the litigation (and all related cases) that were alleged or could have been alleged in the litigation, the Third Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint or any other pleading or other document filed in the litigation, whether the claims are brought directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any Settlement Class Member in an individual or class action, representative action or in any other capacity, with respect to any form of relief, including without limitation damages, restitution, disgorgement, penalties, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “&lt;strong&gt;Released Parties&lt;/strong&gt;” are Zappos, and all of its present, former and future officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys, servants, heirs, administrators, executors, members, member entities, predecessors, successors, subsidiaries (direct and indirect), parents (direct and indirect) (including, but not limited to, Amazon.com, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries), affiliates (controlling, controlled by or under common control with Zappos), representatives, trustees, principals, insurers, vendors and assigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the settlement is &lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; approved by the Court, and if you use or transfer your discount code, Zappos may argue at a later date that you have already been fully compensated by your use or transfer of the discount code, and accordingly that you are not entitled to any other relief; however, you may present any arguments in opposition to Zappos’s arguments if this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;24.943310657596&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I Exclude Myself From the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to receive benefits from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue Defendant on your own and at your own expense about the issues in this case, then you must take steps to exclude yourself from the settlement. This is also called “opting out” of the settlement. To exclude yourself from the settlement (opt out), you must send a letter to the Settlement Administrator at the following address containing: (1) your signature; (2) your full name, address, email address and Zappos.com account number, if any; and (3) a statement that you request to be excluded from the Settlement Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zappos Settlement Administrator - Exclusions&lt;br/&gt;P.O. Box 43434&lt;br/&gt;Providence, RI 02940-3434&lt;br/&gt;info@zapposdatasettlement.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opt out deadline is November 29, 2019 and, to be valid, an opt out request must be postmarked no later than that date. If you request exclusion from the settlement, you will not get any settlement benefits, and you cannot object to the terms of the settlement. You will not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit. &lt;span&gt;If you use or transfer your discount code, you are not permitted to exclude yourself and you will be bound by the terms of the settlement, including the release of claims, if the settlement is approved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12.952955367913&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I Don’t Exclude Myself, Can I Sue Defendant for the Same Thing Later?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Unless you exclude yourself, you &lt;span&gt;give up any right&lt;/span&gt; to sue Defendant and/or any of the Released Parties for the claims that this settlement resolves, if the settlement is approved by the Court. If you have a pending lawsuit covering these same claims, speak to your lawyer in that case immediately. You must exclude yourself from this Settlement Class to continue your own lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if the settlement is not approved by the Court but you have used or transferred your discount code, Zappos may argue that such use or transfer has fully compensated you and Zappos may argue for that reason that you may no longer pursue a claim against Zappos; however, you would be permitted to present arguments in opposition to Zappos’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9.9383983572895&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Have a Lawyer in the Case?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has appointed Ben Barnow (Barnow and Associates, P.C.), Jeremiah Frei-Pearson (Finkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson &amp;amp; Garber, LLP), Mark Godino (Glancy Prongay &amp;amp; Murray, LLP) and Richard Coffman (The Coffman Law Firm) to represent you and other Class Members as Class Counsel. Class Counsel will be paid by Zappos and you will not be charged for this. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;17.747316267547&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Will the Lawyers, the Class Representatives and the Settlement Administrator Be Paid?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zappos will pay the Settlement Administrator for the costs associated with administering the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of up to $1,620,000 in total to Class Counsel (and to additional plaintiff’s counsel who worked on the case) for attorneys’ fees, out-of-pocket costs, and service awards to the Class Representatives. The service award requests will amount to $22,500 of the $1,620,000 total, or $2,500 for each of the nine Class Representatives. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, negotiating the settlement and following through to make sure that its terms are carried out. The service awards reflect Class Representatives’ efforts to pursue the case and to provide information and documents in support of the claims. The Court may award less than the requested amounts. Class Counsel will file with the Court their motion for award of attorneys’ fees and litigation costs and Class Representatives’ service awards no later than November 20, 2019. After that date, you may view the motion under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/case-documents.aspx&quot; title=&quot;Case Documents&quot;&gt;Case Documents&lt;/a&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;21.963993453355&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do I Tell the Court That I Don’t Like the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask the Court to deny approval of the Settlement by making an objection. You can’t ask the Court to order a larger settlement; the Court can only approve or deny the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must object to the proposed settlement in writing. All written objections and supporting papers must include: (1) your full name and postal address, and, if represented by counsel, the name, bar number, address and telephone number of your attorney; (2) a statement that you are a Settlement Class Member; (3) documents establishing, or information sufficient to allow the Parties to confirm, that you are a Settlement Class Member; (4) a statement whether you intend to appear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through counsel; (5) a statement of your specific objections and the grounds supporting the objections; (6) identification and production of copies of any documents that you desire the Court to consider; and (7) your original signature (for individuals) or the original signature of a legally-authorized representative (for entities). Your objection must be filed with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada by November 29, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objections made through counsel must be filed and served electronically through the Court’s CM/ECF system. If you are not represented by counsel and file your objection with the Court in paper format, you must also mail copies of your objection to Class Counsel and Counsel for Zappos postmarked no later than November 29, 2019, at the address below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;11.964035964036&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the Difference Between Objecting to the Settlement and Requesting Exclusion from the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objecting is telling the Court that you do not like something about the settlement. You can object &lt;span&gt;only if&lt;/span&gt; you stay in the Settlement Class. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not want to be part of the Settlement Class or participate in the settlement. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. You cannot both object to and exclude yourself from the settlement. Those who attempt to both object and exclude themselves from the settlement will be deemed to have excluded themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use or transfer your discount code, you may still object to the settlement. However, if you use or transfer your discount code, you are not permitted to exclude yourself and you will be bound by the settlement and release (give up) all claims as described above and in the settlement agreement, if the Court approves the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;15.953307392996&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and Where Will the Court Decide Whether to Approve the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing regarding the settlement on December 20, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 3 of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, located at 400 S. Virginia Street, Reno, Nevada 89501. At that hearing, the Court will consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider them. The Court will listen to people who ask to speak at the hearing that have timely filed an objection and given notice of their intent to appear. The Court also will decide how much to pay to Class Counsel and the Class Representatives. At or after the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the settlement. Class Counsel does not know how long those decisions will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Final Approval Hearing date, time or location may be changed and notice of any change will be provided on this website, so please check back regularly if you plan to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;7.9533073929961&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Have to Come to the Hearing?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Class Counsel will answer questions the Court may have. You are welcome to come at your own expense. If you send an objection, you don’t have to come to Court to talk about it. As long as you submit your written objection on time, the Court will consider it. You may also have your own lawyer attend the hearing at your own expense, but doing so is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot submit an objection or speak at the hearing if you excluded yourself from the Settlement Class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;3.9697732997481&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens if I Do Nothing at All?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do nothing, you will remain in the Settlement Class and will be bound by the terms of the settlement and all of the Court’s orders, including the Release. This also means that you will not receive any settlement benefits and can’t sue or be part of any other lawsuit against Defendant or the other Released Parties about the issues in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
