<title>SpaceX to lay off 10% of Workforce</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-layoffs-20190111-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-layoffs-20190111-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Even with SpaceX’s ramp-up of satellite launches — 21 in 2018, up from 18 the year before, and on Friday the first one of this year — it has occasionally cut its workforce. Last summer, the company fired some senior managers at the company’s Redmond, Wash., office because of disagreements over the pacing of the development and testing of its Starlink satellite program.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Can No Longer Recommend Google Fi</title>
<link>https://onemileatatime.com/google-fi-review/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://onemileatatime.com/google-fi-review/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;boardingpack-content-filter-1&quot; class=&quot;boardingpack-content-filter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;flipboard-remove&quot;&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, One Mile At A Time earns a referral bonus for anyone that’s approved through some of the below links. These are the best publicly available offers that we have found for each card. Opinions expressed here are the author's alone, not those of the bank, credit card issuer, airlines or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities. Please check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/one-mile-time-advertising-policy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my advertiser policy&lt;/a&gt; for further details about our partners, including American Express, Capital One, Chase, and Citi, and thanks for your support!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/best-cell-phone-plan-international-travel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fiercely evangelical about Project Fi since Google launched their cell phone service a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;. The plans have saved me a ton compared to a legacy mobile carrier, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/google-fi-international-pokemon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;un-throttled international coverage has been life-changing&lt;/a&gt;, and I adored the functionality and photo quality of my Pixel 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because I’ve been so enthusiastic about the service, I think it’s important to update y’all about some recent experiences and research, along with why I am withdrawing my endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, 10/10 would not recommend. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a support perspective, Google Fi was not ready to expand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Fi recently rebranded to Google Fi, as part of an expansion that opened the platform to a few dozen more devices, including iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-174288&quot; src=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Google-Fi-Overview-1024x727.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;727&quot; srcset=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Google-Fi-Overview-1024x727.png 1024w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Google-Fi-Overview-700x497.png 700w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Google-Fi-Overview-768x545.png 768w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Google-Fi-Overview.png 1434w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m not sure all the components of that rapid growth were thought through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Pixel 3 is a little defective (or possibly a lemon). There are issues with calls dropping in locations where the Pixel 2 never had issues, the screen isn’t consistently responsive to touch feedback, the fingerprint reader is intermittent, and so forth. It happens, and I don’t feel like this is a failure of Fi — manufacturing just isn’t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, whenever I had issues with my Pixel 2 or prior Fi-enabled devices, the third-party support center was &lt;em&gt;phenomenal.&lt;/em&gt; I’ve had them help me with hardware issues, system issues, a phone that just wouldn’t connect to WiFi, or tethering that didn’t work when it was supposed to — every interaction was great, and resulted in the problem being solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, this has not been the case. My calls and chats to support have gone nowhere, and the once-great support staff have been replaced (or supplemented) by random people using generic scripts. I’m sure the awesome trouble-shooters are still there, but the sampling I’ve seen doesn’t suggest pervasive competency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure everything will eventually get resolved, and I have a lot of redundancy built in to my tech needs, but it’s super frustrating to have a brand-new phone not work as well as the device its replacing, and for tech support to be unhelpful about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Fi doesn’t function independently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know this previously, because honestly — we all have better things to care about than the backend of a merchant’s payment processing systems. My Project Fi payments earned 5x points on my &lt;a title=&quot;Ink Cash [Benefits Only]&quot; href=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/go/ink-cash/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-nojs=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Ink Business Cash℠ Credit Card&lt;/a&gt;, and that was about the extent of my interest level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, &lt;strong&gt;anything run by Google that takes money goes through Google Payments at some point&lt;/strong&gt;, which is fine when things are fine, but horrible when they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Google Payments is broken, your entire Google ecosystem is broken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband has been dealing with this for the past five weeks, and it’s basically a tire fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made a purchase through the Google Store (for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/google-fi-iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pixel 3 during the travel promotion&lt;/a&gt;, but it could just as easily have been an in-app purchase, or premium content on YouTube, or literally anything where Google collects the money). There were some issues with the payment (Chase declined the initial transaction as suspicious due to some other fraud I’d had on the card that same day, but Google still shipped the phone instead of flagging the payment, and &lt;em&gt;obviously that’s not how the exchange of money for goods is supposed to work&lt;/em&gt;), and the process of getting that figured out triggered a “security check” with Google Payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note, however, that &lt;strong&gt;the exact circumstances don’t really matter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve since learned, if a card in your Google Pay is stolen, or someone uses your Payments account fraudulently, or anything happens that leads to a security flag being raised, it can lead to your Google Payments account being frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that can wreak havoc on your Google life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can’t use Google Payments, you can’t pay for Google Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, fundamentally, is why I can’t suggest &lt;em&gt;anyon&lt;/em&gt;e use Project Fi anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband has always paid his Google Fi bill with his Ink Plus, and has nearly three years of on-time (automatic) payments. This is the only card linked to his account, and there’s no indication that the Fi and Payments accounts “talk”. So while we were fixing the issue with the Google Store (which was on a completely different card), we didn’t give any thought to how it might impact other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Fi suspended his service for non-payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his Android/Google Pay stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his ability to make YouTube purchases ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all in-app purchases started failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he could no longer use Hangouts to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting this fixed is actually impossible&lt;/strong&gt;, and I say that as someone who really, truly, loves solving problems and has made a living off &lt;a href=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/long-sell-airline-tickets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;getting phone agents to want to help me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have submitted copies of his ID four times, my ID twice, multiple photos of credit cards, and various credit card statements. We’ve talked to agents and supervisors at Google Payments and Google Fi. No one is empowered to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, and even a well-intentioned agent doesn’t get the same answer from the “security department” twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve since found hundreds of comments and Reddit threads from people having similar experiences, with almost zero positive conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;em&gt;suggestion&lt;/em&gt; of a solution we’ve been given is that he abandon both his email address and phone number of the past twenty years and start fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to escalate, no timeline for resolution, and until that secret department (which consumers aren’t allowed to talk to) finishes their process with Google Payments, you can’t pay your bill. Google Fi won’t restore service or allow your number to be ported out until the bill is paid, so around and around we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-103072&quot; src=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Project-Fi-Review-19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; srcset=&quot;https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Project-Fi-Review-19.jpg 1000w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Project-Fi-Review-19-700x525.jpg 700w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Project-Fi-Review-19-768x576.jpg 768w, https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Project-Fi-Review-19-300x225.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the crux of the issue for me — at the end of the day, no matter how awful AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon are (and we’ve all had some awful experiences), they’ll take your money. You could walk into the store with a bag of coins or a stack of sweaty dollar bills, and they’d take your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the simple fact that Google Fi can’t manage that is a deal-breaker for me. You’re either prepared to run a service business, or you’re not, and these recent experiences have reminded me that when it comes to Google (and other large tech companies) you have very little recourse when the Internet doesn’t “just work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don’t know that I feel comfortable putting an essential communication tool in the hands of a company that is taking this kind of approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’m not trying to get sympathy here — dealing with companies is often annoying, and that’s just part of being an adult. But when we’ve recommended a product or service to readers based on certain experiences, and circumstances change, I think it’s important to address it, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;when I haven’t otherwise had negatives to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly hasn’t been convenient for my husband to not have phone service for weeks, but the realities of our life at this moment of time have meant it’s also not impossible. He telecommutes as well, and we spent most of the holidays together or with family, so he’s been around WiFi or with me (and able to tether off my phone) 95% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were me, &lt;strong&gt;not having a phone would be a non-starter, and I suspect the same is true for many of you&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course if I was abroad I could buy a temporary SIM card and tether with my hotspot, or otherwise would work it out, but that shouldn’t be necessary when you are ready, able, and willing to pay a phone bill and the provider just can’t figure out how to process the payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with the support experiences I’ve had, the deterioration of the service at Google Fi makes the platform feel very uncertain to me, and I just don’t feel comfortable recommending anyone else move over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, &lt;strong&gt;if you’re currently on Google Fi, and aren’t &lt;em&gt;extremely nimble&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to managing your connectivity, you might want to think about moving back to a traditional carrier&lt;/strong&gt;. You may pay a bit more, but unless you can guarantee that you will never have any issue that you might need Fi’s help with and would thus be inconvenienced by, it’s probably a worthwhile tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else had issues with Google Fi recently? Were you able to get them resolved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;qengine is a cross-platform retro game engine. It is aimed at nostalgic game developers that miss simple times and enjoy creating games like it's 1997. The software renderer provides the aesthetic that we all love and the engine limitations exist to make your creativity shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine is a fork of the Quake II codebase that focuses on serving as a base for standalone games. Unlike other ports, it does not aim at being compatible with mods or the base Quake II game. In fact, many features were removed to reduce the complexity of the codebase and make the process of creating new games on top of the engine easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of overly specific gameplay code, such as enemies and weapons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge of modules into a single package. No more DLLs, just a single executable for client and another for server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removal of OpenGL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/klaussilveira/qengine/blob/master/docs/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/klaussilveira/qengine/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;qengine screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free, open source and community-driven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qengine stands on the shoulders of giants from the Quake II community. The code is built upon Yamagi Quake II, which itself contains code from other amazing projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hecatomb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icculus Quake 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KMQuake2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q2Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QuDoS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;r1q2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stereo quake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zeq2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide a clean and maintainable base game engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve stability across different platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance the software renderer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve documentation of asset pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qengine is released under the terms of the GPL version 2. See the LICENSE file for further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compiling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine will look for game data in the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder. You can start from scratch, or use the original Quake II game data if you own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included with the engine there are quite a few useful tools. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mapping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;qbsp3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;qrad3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;qvis3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bspinfo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Textures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pcx2wal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pcx2pal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colormap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16to8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Re-decentralizing the Web, for good this time</title>
<link>https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Originally designed as &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; network, the Web has undergone &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a significant&lt;/span&gt; centralization in recent years. In order to regain freedom and control over the digital aspects of our lives, we should understand how we arrived at this point and how we can get back &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;on track.&lt;/span&gt; This chapter explains the history of decentralization in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Web&lt;/span&gt; context, and details Tim Berners-Lee’s role in the continued battle for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a free&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;open Web.&lt;/span&gt; The challenges and solutions are not purely technical in nature, but rather fit into &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a larger&lt;/span&gt; socio-economic puzzle, to which all of us are invited to contribute. Let us take back the Web &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;for good&lt;/span&gt;, and leverage its full potential as envisioned by &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;its creator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-to-the-people&quot;&gt;Power to the people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-1&quot;&gt;As an inventor, you might envision &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a purpose&lt;/span&gt; and destiny for your creation—&lt;wbr/&gt;yet ultimately, people decide how they put it &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;to use.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;John Pemberton&lt;/span&gt; aimed to cure morphine addicts when he started brewing the potion now known as &lt;em&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Noah McVicker&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Play-Doh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; served as &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a wall&lt;/span&gt;-cleaner before it became &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a children&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;s toy&lt;/span&gt;, and Alfred Nobel declared yearly prizes so he would not be remembered for dynamite’s military purposes. Admirably, Tim Berners-Lee never even intended to control his own invention: his former employer &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CERN&lt;/abbr&gt; released the World Wide Web software openly, and the Web itself is designed in a &lt;em&gt;decentralized&lt;/em&gt; way so that &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;no one&lt;/span&gt; can decide who can say what. This unprecedented openness has led to large-scale &lt;em&gt;permissionless innovation&lt;/em&gt; and unbounded creativity, provides &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a voice&lt;/span&gt; to more than half of the world’s population, and has revolutionized communication, education, and business. However, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a consequence&lt;/span&gt; of this freedom is also that anyone can create things that go against the spirit of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the Web&lt;/span&gt;, such as illegal materials and—&lt;wbr/&gt;ironically—&lt;wbr/&gt;platforms whose primary goal is &lt;em&gt;centralization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-2&quot;&gt;The concept of centralization does not pose &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a problem&lt;/span&gt; in and of itself: there are good reasons for bringing people and things together. The situation becomes problematic when we are robbed of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;our choice&lt;/span&gt;, deceived into thinking there is only one access gate to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a space&lt;/span&gt; that, in reality, we &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;collectively own.&lt;/span&gt; Some &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;time ago&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;it seemed&lt;/span&gt; unimaginable that &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a fundamentally&lt;/span&gt; open platform like the Web would become the foundation for closed spaces, where we pay with our personal data for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a fraction&lt;/span&gt; of the freedoms that are actually &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;already ours.&lt;/span&gt; Yet &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a majority&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web users&lt;/span&gt; today find themselves confined to the boundaries of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a handful&lt;/span&gt; of influential social networks for their daily interactions. Such networks gather opinions from all over the world, only to condense that richness into one space, where they simultaneously act as the director and judge of the resulting stream they present &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;to us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-3&quot;&gt;Because this change happened so suddenly, perhaps we need &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a reminder&lt;/span&gt; that the Web landscape looked quite different not even that long ago. In 2008, Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan was sentenced to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;20 years&lt;/span&gt; of jail, primarily because of blog posts he had written. He and many others were able to state their critical opinions because they had the Web as an open platform, so they did not depend on anyone’s permission to publish their words. Crucially, the Web’s hyperlinking mechanism lets blogs point to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;each other&lt;/span&gt;, again without requiring any form of permission. This allows for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; value network between equals, where readers remain in active and conscious control of their &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;next move.&lt;/span&gt; When Derakhshan was eventually released in 2014, he &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;came back to an entirely different Web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;: critical readers had transformed into passive viewers, as if watching television. While Web technology had &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/span&gt; evolved, its core foundations had not—&lt;wbr/&gt;it was the way people were using the Web that had become unrecognizable &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in a mere 6 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-4&quot;&gt;Of course, social media are not our enemies here: they should be credited with lowering the barrier for the online publication of short texts and photos by anyone. Yet they operate under a &lt;em&gt;winner-&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;takes-all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; strategy, each striving to become the dominant portal instead of mutually interoperating like the rest of the Web. In contrast to blogs, we typically cannot interact with posts in one network from within another: we would need to either move the people or &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the data.&lt;/span&gt; This famous &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/node/10880516&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;walled gardens&lt;/q&gt; problem of social media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; has significantly worsened since 2008, because some gardens have grown huge while their walls remain &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in place.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A major&lt;/span&gt; problem is that access to the dominant networks invariably means giving up control over our personal data: we can enter through the door in the wall if we pay with our digital belongings. That personal data can then be leveraged to unwittingly influence us through excessively personalized advertising for brands, products, and even political agendas. Furthermore, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;once there&lt;/span&gt;, people tend to form small conversational circles within each garden—&lt;wbr/&gt;an effect that is further amplified by the inward focus of social media platforms and their algorithms that favor maximizing engagement &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;over diversity.&lt;/span&gt; The resulting &lt;em&gt;filter bubble&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; isolates us into our own echo chambers, whereas the Web’s purpose—&lt;wbr/&gt;and social media’s claim—&lt;wbr/&gt;has &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;always been to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-5&quot;&gt;Unsurprisingly, these problems are reflected in &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three challenges for the Web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; that Tim Berners-Lee put forward &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in 2017&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;taking back control of our personal data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preventing the spread of misinformation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;realizing transparency for political advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-6&quot;&gt;Clearly, it is undesirable to tackle these challenges through centralized solutions, for instance by appointing an authority for personal data, news, and advertising. This would create yet another single point of failure, which—&lt;wbr/&gt;even assuming the best of intentions—&lt;wbr/&gt;would always be more vulnerable to abuse. The core issue in this situation is ultimately not one with the individual social networks, but with their hyper-centralization of data and people, and therefore power. We want control, but we want to put that control in the hands of every person, as &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a right&lt;/span&gt; they can choose to exercise over the data &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;they create&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-7&quot;&gt;From the above, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; clear that &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our primary obstacles are not technological&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;; hence &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee’s call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;q&gt;assemble the brightest minds from business, technology, government, civil society, the arts, and academia to tackle the threats to the Web’s future&lt;/q&gt;. Yet at the same time, computer scientists and engineers need to deliver the &lt;em&gt;technological burden of proof&lt;/em&gt; that decentralized personal data networks can scale globally and that they can provide people with an experience similar to that of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;centralized platforms&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;power-to-the-people-p-8&quot;&gt;In this chapter, we will therefore start with &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a technological&lt;/span&gt; perspective on decentralization, highlighting Tim Berners-Lee’s role in the continuing fight to keep the Web open and decentralized. After &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a historical&lt;/span&gt; overview of power struggles on the Web, we will zoom in on the changes that decentralization requires, and examine what &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a more&lt;/span&gt; healthy ecosystem would look like. &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;As a concrete&lt;/span&gt; implementation of these principles, we will study the Solid project. We will end with &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/span&gt; of open challenges and an outlook on &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ashort-history-of-de-centralization-and-the-web&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A short&lt;/span&gt; history of (de-)centralization and the Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ashort-history-of-de-centralization-and-the-web-p-1&quot;&gt;The arrows of the decentralization movement have not always been aimed at social media—&lt;wbr/&gt;and they likely will not be anymore at some point in the future. The forces causing centralization have instead been &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a moving&lt;/span&gt; target: every time &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a threat&lt;/span&gt; had been addressed, an even bigger one superseded it. Understanding these threats will provide us with insights into the different facets of decentralization and &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;their importance&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralization-as-the-unspoken-assumption&quot;&gt;Decentralization as the unspoken assumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;decentralization-as-the-unspoken-assumption-p-1&quot;&gt;Decentralized systems, which do not require &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a central&lt;/span&gt; mediator to function, were already around at the time the Web was invented. Most notably, the Internet was increasingly gaining popularity as &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a large&lt;/span&gt;-scale decentralized network. Email was even more decentralized than the traditional postal mail service it mimicked, since different mail servers would directly exchange messages with each other. Long forgotten protocols such as the Network News Transfer Protocol (&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NNTP&lt;/abbr&gt;) allowed for the decentralized exchange of news articles. In short, decentralization was not some crazy new idea, but rather the spirit of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the time&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;decentralization-as-the-unspoken-assumption-p-2&quot;&gt;Therefore, when Tim Berners-Lee set out to design &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a new&lt;/span&gt; hypertext system in 1989, it was presumed to be decentralized, in contrast to documentation systems of the time, but in alignment with &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;many others.&lt;/span&gt; The main selling point of the Web was its &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/0323-yorkshire-tbl/slide5-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;universality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-7&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, its independence of, among others, hardware and software; decentralization was simply the unspoken assumption. This is reflected in the original article introducing the Web &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-8&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;, which emphasizes universal readability across operating systems, but does not mention the term &lt;q&gt;decentralization&lt;/q&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;at all&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;decentralization-as-the-unspoken-assumption-p-3&quot;&gt;The only component with centralized roots in the Web’s architectural design is the Domain Name System (&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/abbr&gt;), which resolves the domain name part of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Web&lt;/span&gt; address (such as &lt;em&gt;example.org&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a physical&lt;/span&gt; machine on the Internet. This was not as much of an issue back in the days when the number of domains was relatively small and domain ownership would be stationary. Nowadays, millions of domain names frequently change hands, thereby breaking existing links in possibly malicious ways. By manipulating &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/abbr&gt;, governments can block or alter access to existing websites. Tim Berners-Lee has indicated that, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in hindsight&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a more&lt;/span&gt; decentralized naming system might have been preferred. Apart from that, the Web contained all ingredients to thrive in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-race-for-our-desktop&quot;&gt;The race for our desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-desktop-p-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A first&lt;/span&gt; wave of centralization resulted as collateral damage from the &lt;em&gt;browser war&lt;/em&gt; of the nineties, in which companies competed to become the sole vendor of the software through which we access the Web. The Web’s design principle of universality demanded readability on any platform, so the emergence of multiple browsers was &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a blessing&lt;/span&gt;—&lt;wbr/&gt;except that they strived for market domination rather than mutually beneficial co-existence. The Netscape browser and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer tried to convert each other’s users through new features, with Internet Explorer reaching over 90% of connected desktops at &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;its peek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-desktop-p-2&quot;&gt;While competition through innovation is fine, these features came at the cost of incompatibility across browsers and therefore directly endangered the Web’s universality. Websites would carry badges such as &lt;q&gt;best viewed in Internet Explorer&lt;/q&gt;, since &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a consistent&lt;/span&gt; experience across platforms could not be guaranteed. Those who did not want to use &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a particular&lt;/span&gt; browser—&lt;wbr/&gt;or who could not install it because no compatible version for their system existed—&lt;wbr/&gt;would be unable to access such websites fully or at all. The resulting de-facto browser monopoly infringed on people’s preference for browser or operating system, centralizing the Web’s decision process in one company that thereby determined the rate &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;of innovation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-desktop-p-3&quot;&gt;The World Wide Web Consortium (&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt;) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee with &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a mission&lt;/span&gt; of compatibility, enabling cross-browser consistency through recommendations that specify the correct workings of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web technologies.&lt;/span&gt; While &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt; standardization is administratively centralized, it incorporates feedback from &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; network of members through &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a consensus&lt;/span&gt;-driven process. &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A problem&lt;/span&gt; by the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;early 2000s&lt;/span&gt; was that Internet Explorer deviated from &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt; recommendations at crucial points, forcing developers to follow either the actual standards or their incorrect implementation in the most &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;popular browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-desktop-p-4&quot;&gt;Fortunately, pressure from Firefox and Safari during &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a second&lt;/span&gt; browser war eventually &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://alistapart.com/article/beyonddoctype&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forced Microsoft onto &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a more&lt;/span&gt; standards-oriented course&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-9&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2010, no single browser has gained more than two thirds of global &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/span&gt; anymore, meaning that standards compatibility is now in the interest of browser vendors and Web developers alike. The balkanization of the Web through centralized browser development has thereby largely &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;been averted&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-race-for-our-searches&quot;&gt;The race for our searches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-searches-p-1&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s short-lived victory after the first browser war quickly turned out to be insignificant, since the centralization battle had gradually shifted to other fields. While each browser was quarreling to become the default application, &lt;em&gt;search engines&lt;/em&gt; were racing to become the main entry point. Soon, it did not matter anymore what software you used for browsing; what mattered was who gave you the directions of where to browse next. After all, no immediate income could be generated from free browser development, whereas companies would gladly pay for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a prime&lt;/span&gt; spot in one of the major search engines’ rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-searches-p-2&quot;&gt;The early search engine landscape featured several competitors, such as AltaVista and Lycos, but it took Google only &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a couple&lt;/span&gt; of years to become by far the most popular. The centralization of search meant that one company gained an overly strong influence on what content people would access, based on the ordering of search results for given terms. Even assuming the best of intentions and ignoring paid advertising, the fact that one algorithm makes decisions for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a large&lt;/span&gt; number of people leads to an information bias, as there clearly exists no single objective way to rank the &lt;q&gt;best&lt;/q&gt; webpages on &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;any topic.&lt;/span&gt; External attempts to manipulate these algorithms started to occur, first through relatively simple interventions such as misleading keywords, later through advanced Search Engine Optimization (&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/abbr&gt;) techniques that aimed to improve website rankings in various (and sometimes dubious) ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-searches-p-3&quot;&gt;The advent of search engines also brought the first online monetization of user-generated data. Our search terms contribute to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a detailed&lt;/span&gt; profile of what we need in our private and professional lives. Search engines might know more about some aspects of our lives than our close friends. This profile determines the ads we receive and the personalization of our search results, encouraging us to visit websites and buy things we otherwise might not have. While personalization has helpful effects for many people, the problem is that we are left without choice or control. We are directed to the large search engines, which, due to their large accumulation of data, provide us with the best search experience. Yet these search engines do not provide us with options for how we want to pay for their services, as most of them only accept our personal data. Furthermore, we are not informed about—&lt;wbr/&gt;let alone given control over—&lt;wbr/&gt;how exactly our data influences our search results. The increasing personalization gave rise to the first filter bubbles &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, wherein we are more likely to see results similar to those we previously &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;clicked on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-race-for-our-personal-data-and-identity&quot;&gt;The race for our personal data and identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-personal-data-and-identity-p-1&quot;&gt;While the hegemony of Google still continues, social media have found an even more powerful way of collecting and marketing our personal data. The social Web revolution of the 2000s encouraged people to be present online, which drove many &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;of us&lt;/span&gt; to various platforms to share blog posts, bookmarks, photos, videos, and more. Some year later, social media companies created centralized platforms to take over many of these features, which until then were spread out across multiple providers. These platforms store our personal data and request far-reaching usage rights in exchange for their services, all of which operate within their own &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;walled garden&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-personal-data-and-identity-p-2&quot;&gt;Like search engines, the main service of social networks consists of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a linear&lt;/span&gt; list of content, ranked by factors and algorithms we can only minimally influence. In contrast to search, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a social&lt;/span&gt; feed is generated without any input terms from our side, like &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a television&lt;/span&gt; that no longer requires &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a remote.&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;ensuing show&lt;/span&gt; is meticulously personalized based on data we consciously left on social network platforms, combined with traces from our browsing history picked up—&lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://berjon.com/advertising-war-on-consent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;without our &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;concious consent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-10&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;—by social trackers on third-party websites. In his 2018 Dertouzos distinguished lecture, Tim Berners-Lee mentioned that &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/utopia-dystopia-29-short-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;political advertising has been banned from television in the &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-11&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; because of concerns about the impact of such &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a direct&lt;/span&gt; medium. Yet by that logic, he continued, we should be much more concerned about the heavily personalized political advertising that current social media platforms enable and allow. Even if we refrain from explicitly sharing certain sensitive traits, seemingly insignificant pieces of other data can be combined into reliable predictors of highly personal information &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-12&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; such as sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religious or political views, which are subsequently used to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;target us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-personal-data-and-identity-p-3&quot;&gt;As in the previous two centralization races, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a subtle&lt;/span&gt; force is exerted upon us: we feel pressured to be part of the large networks, because &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;not joining&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;missing out&lt;/span&gt; on the volatile virtual traces of our friends’ and family members’ lives. Often the easiest way for grandparents to see their grandchildren’s latest pictures is to create &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Facebook&lt;/span&gt; or Instagram account. This is how the digital memory of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a large&lt;/span&gt; part of today’s generation ends up in one space, often beyond control of those that are part of the memories. The centralization of our online activities has become so extreme that &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;http://lirneasia.net/2014/08/more-facebook-users-than-internet-users-in-south-east-asia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some Facebook users have become unaware of their ability to access the Internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;. This paradox has sadly become &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a reality&lt;/span&gt; in many countries, where Facebook’s &lt;em&gt;Internet.org&lt;/em&gt; initiative provides &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a severely&lt;/span&gt; constrained version of the Web that further reduces people’s options, in blatant violation of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Net Neutrality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-race-for-our-personal-data-and-identity-p-4&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, another race is happening in the background, namely the battle to become our &lt;em&gt;identity provider&lt;/em&gt;. An increasing number of websites are gradually replacing their own login systems with authentication tied to large platforms such as Google or Facebook. For people with an existing account, the &lt;q&gt;Log in with Facebook&lt;/q&gt; buttons are &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a convenience.&lt;/span&gt; For those without, they form additional pressure to join. And in both cases, such buttons are yet another way of tracking our online activities. This centralization of identity takes away our freedom to assume the persona we want—&lt;wbr/&gt;be it anonymous, pseudonymous, our just ourselves—&lt;wbr/&gt;without needing to expose data we consider &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;our own&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service&quot;&gt;Data ownership by decoupling storage from service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service-p-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A recurring&lt;/span&gt; theme in the above centralization races is the lack of choice: &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a choice&lt;/span&gt; of browser and operating system, of entry point to the Web, of storage for our personal data. Decentralization is fundamentally about &lt;em&gt;enabling choice&lt;/em&gt;, by breaking up artificially coupled decisions into individual options that can be combined at will. Just as we are free to choose any combination of device, operating system, and browser to access the Web, we should be able to interact with websites and other people without commitment to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a single&lt;/span&gt; social or &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;other platform&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service-p-2&quot;&gt;Taking back control of our personal data, as envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, is realized by &lt;em&gt;decoupling data storage from services&lt;/em&gt;. This means people can store their data wherever they choose, while still enjoying the services they want. We can pick any provider to store our texts, photos, and videos—&lt;wbr/&gt;or simply store them on our own &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web server&lt;/span&gt;—&lt;wbr/&gt;and rely on any third-party service to interact with them, regardless of storage location. The crucial service of &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; can, but does not need to, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;be provided&lt;/span&gt; by the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data storage&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service-p-3&quot;&gt;This mindset gives rise to the concept of a &lt;em&gt;personal data pod&lt;/em&gt;, in which we can store every single piece of information we produce. As shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#social-media-post&quot;&gt;the figure below&lt;/a&gt; this statement can be taken quite literally: even &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a seemingly&lt;/span&gt; trivial piece of data, such as simple &lt;q&gt;like&lt;/q&gt; we gave &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a certain&lt;/span&gt; webpage or thing, can be stored in our &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;own pod.&lt;/span&gt; While such &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a degree&lt;/span&gt; of decentralization might seem extreme, recall that even supposedly trivial likes can reveal much deeper personal information &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-12&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;, so it makes sense to give people control over them. Furthermore, since we do not depend on anyone’s permission to publish data &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in our own pod&lt;/span&gt;, we can place likes, annotations, and comments on anything we want, without fear of them being censored &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;or deleted&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/images/blog/decentralized-facebook.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; On &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; Web, every piece of data can be stored in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a place&lt;/span&gt; chosen by its author.
&lt;p id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service-p-4&quot;&gt;This total data ownership enables highly granular &lt;em&gt;access control&lt;/em&gt;: people can selectively give permission to friends or applications to read or write specific parts of their data pod. For instance, they can decide whether or not they make their profile picture and full name public, who can see which of their likes and comments, and what applications can edit their pictures or posts on their behalf. These permissions can be changed or revoked at any time. People can have multiple data pods for different purposes, for instance, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a pod&lt;/span&gt; for personal and family pictures at home, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a pod&lt;/span&gt; governed by retention policies for professional data at the workplace, and &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a university&lt;/span&gt; pod with study materials and grades. Upon creation, they can decide which data is stored in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;which pod&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;data-ownership-by-decoupling-storage-from-service-p-5&quot;&gt;By choosing the storage location of our own data, we prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. We are no longer obliged to pay with our data in order to access &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a certain&lt;/span&gt; service. Moreover, we can protect the most sensitive parts of our data by keeping them to ourselves, and limit sharing to people and services that really &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;require it&lt;/span&gt;—&lt;wbr/&gt;but only for as long as they &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;need it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;independent-innovation-on-separate-data-and-service-markets&quot;&gt;Independent innovation on separate data and service markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;independent-innovation-on-separate-data-and-service-markets-p-1&quot;&gt;When people store their own data, privacy-unfriendly business models centered around data ownership will not be viable anymore. Such an economic change can be accelerated through legislation, like the &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;’s General Data Protection Regulation (&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/abbr&gt;), as well as growing awareness among the general population about the dangers of centralization, given recent data scandals at companies such as Equifax and Facebook. Consequently, new business models for applications &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;become necessary&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;independent-innovation-on-separate-data-and-service-markets-p-2&quot;&gt;Decentralization requires the nature of applications to evolve from silos to shared views. &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;As shown&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#apps-as-views&quot;&gt;the figure below&lt;/a&gt;, current Web apps combine &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;. Because of this coupling, our LinkedIn contacts cannot comment on our Facebook pictures, and an &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSVP&lt;/abbr&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Facebook&lt;/span&gt; event will not be reflected in our Doodle calendar’s availability. Decentralized applications, on the other hand, act as &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; on top of our data pod and those of others. When granted specific access rights, photos uploaded into our data pod by &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a photo&lt;/span&gt; gallery application can be accessed by &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a social&lt;/span&gt; feed app. Events in my personal calendar that have public visibility can show up in the same feed. Our friends can view the parts of our data to which we grant them access through whatever application they &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;wish to use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/images/blog/apps-as-views.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; Centralized Web applications act as silos that do not share data with each other. Decentralized Web applications act as shared views on top of personal data pods.
&lt;p id=&quot;independent-innovation-on-separate-data-and-service-markets-p-3&quot;&gt;Because the choice of data and service provider becomes decoupled, &lt;em&gt;separate markets&lt;/em&gt; for data and services emerge. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#separate-markets&quot;&gt;The figure below&lt;/a&gt; shows that centralized applications compete in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a single&lt;/span&gt; market based on data ownership, because usage of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a service&lt;/span&gt; is coupled with usage of its storage. As such, people cannot easily switch to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a better&lt;/span&gt; application experience, as migrating their data—&lt;wbr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;if possible&lt;/span&gt;—&lt;wbr/&gt;is technically challenging. Furthermore, new applications that could offer &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a better&lt;/span&gt; experience have trouble joining the market, since they do not own sufficient data yet. With decentralized &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web applications&lt;/span&gt;, people select their storage and service providers separately, which allows an independent competition on the level of storage and on the level of services. On both levels, the competition is solely based on service quality &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;and features&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;versus cost&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;independent-innovation-on-separate-data-and-service-markets-p-4&quot;&gt;This independence means we can freely switch data and service providers, without requiring our friends to choose the same ones. This brings down the walls in between the gardens, because we gain the ability to reuse and move our data, and can interact with anyone in the entire landscape. Data and service providers can evolve without dependency on each other, which enables &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a faster&lt;/span&gt; and more creative innovation cycle. Anyone can enter either market and attract customers by providing &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a better&lt;/span&gt; experience than others, without asking for control of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;our data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/images/blog/data-and-app-markets.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; Centralized applications compete in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a single&lt;/span&gt; market, based on data ownership. &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;On a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; Web, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data and&lt;/span&gt; service providers compete in different markets.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solid-project&quot;&gt;The Solid project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;the-solid-project-p-1&quot;&gt;In order to realize this vision of data ownership and data/&lt;wbr/&gt;service independence, Tim Berners-Lee started the &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://solid.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Solid project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-14&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;. Solid consists of &lt;em&gt;specifications&lt;/em&gt; for interoperability, &lt;em&gt;implementations&lt;/em&gt; of servers, clients, and applications, and a &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; of people who build new things. In the next sections, we will discuss some of Solid’s &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;unique aspects&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;personal-data-linking-and-integration&quot;&gt;Personal data linking and integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;personal-data-linking-and-integration-p-1&quot;&gt;The goal of Solid is empowering people through &lt;em&gt;personal data management&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a counterpart&lt;/span&gt; to enterprise data management. We can consider &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Solid&lt;/span&gt; server or &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data pod&lt;/span&gt; as the equivalent of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a hard disk&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the Web&lt;/span&gt;, on which we can store arbitrary documents. Then Solid apps are like our desktop applications, except that they open documents from Solid servers on the Web. In contrast to actual &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;hard disks&lt;/span&gt;, Solid servers are typically public to the entire world, so detailed access control settings allow us to specify who can view or edit which of our documents. Tim Berners-Lee has been leading by example, by managing his personal and professional life with Solid for several &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;years already&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;personal-data-linking-and-integration-p-2&quot;&gt;In order for such data management to work at Web scale, data in different pods need to link to each other, similar to how hypertext documents allow us to jump from one website to another. Solid uses &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Linked Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-15&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this: every piece of data can link to any other. This is how, for example, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;/span&gt; in your &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data pod&lt;/span&gt; can be attached to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a photo&lt;/span&gt; in someone else’&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;s pod&lt;/span&gt;, while both of you can remain owners of your data. At runtime, Solid applications integrate data from multiple sources and blend them together into &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a single experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;personal-data-linking-and-integration-p-3&quot;&gt;Solid pods can offer people &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; means of identification. People can pick &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a so&lt;/span&gt;-called &lt;em&gt;WebID&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Web&lt;/span&gt; address that identifies them. This Web address leads to their public profile, and people can &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;log on&lt;/span&gt; to any pod with their own WebID, instead of requiring &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a new&lt;/span&gt; login on every website or resorting to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a centralized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;identity provider&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;readwrite-web&quot;&gt;Read–Write Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;readwrite-web-p-1&quot;&gt;One of the crucial aspects of Solid is that it provides &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Read&lt;/span&gt;–Write platform, as was Tim Berners-Lee’s original intention for the Web &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-16&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;. While writing has always been possible, in the sense that anyone could start their own website, the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/span&gt; and social media revolutions should be credited with making writing considerably easier. This explains part of the success of these platforms, as anyone can now be &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a content&lt;/span&gt; producer at any time, especially through their &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;mobile devices&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;readwrite-web-p-2&quot;&gt;Solid should make authoring content similarly easy, the difference being of course that we would always write to our own data pods instead of to the application through which we create. In doing so, we guarantee that everyone can express themselves without risking censorship. To maximize interoperability, our Linked Data should be stored using Semantic Web technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-17&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;, which interweave &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a piece&lt;/span&gt; of data with its meaning. That way, application can make sense of (parts of) each other’s data, without having to agree upfront exactly what our data should look like. When storing data in our own pods, we need &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a mechanism&lt;/span&gt; to inform others when things have been created or modified—&lt;wbr/&gt;especially if these are comments on their data. This is enabled through &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linked Data Notifications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-18&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;, small automated messages similar to email, which different data pods can send to each other. By combining these technologies, Solid aims to realize the Read–Write Linked Data vision &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-16&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;, in order &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;to ensure&lt;/span&gt; that everyone can participate in the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Web of Data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-for-disruption&quot;&gt;Potential for disruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;potential-for-disruption-p-1&quot;&gt;By transforming data ownership and the role of applications in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; ecosystem, Solid is able to disrupt many interactions that happen on the Web. Many processes that currently depend on centralization can be revolutionized in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a decentralized&lt;/span&gt; way, by cutting out the middlemen that control these processes. This can stimulate innovation in areas that are embracing the current &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;status quo&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;resisting change&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;potential-for-disruption-p-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A first&lt;/span&gt; obvious target are social interactions between people. Sharing multimedia with friends, colleagues, and family members without privacy concerns becomes possible through Solid. Other examples include collaborating on various kinds of documents under transparent access control, and organizing meetings and events—&lt;wbr/&gt;again with full &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data ownership&lt;/span&gt;, choice of application and storage, and synchronization between &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;different apps&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;potential-for-disruption-p-3&quot;&gt;Moreover, Solid has the technological potential to disrupt entire industries, such as for instance &lt;em&gt;scholarly publishing&lt;/em&gt;. The current scholarly publication process assumes that an author uploads &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a scientific&lt;/span&gt; manuscript to &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a centralized&lt;/span&gt; platform, where &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a closed&lt;/span&gt; group of reviewers &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;evaluates it.&lt;/span&gt; After acceptance, the manuscript is published as an article and then becomes accessible to the public, possibly at &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a fee.&lt;/span&gt; This process is rather slow, as the wider scientific community can only read the article at the end—&lt;wbr/&gt;if accepted. It is also non-transparent because valuable artefacts of the process, such as reviews and revisions, &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;remain hidden.&lt;/span&gt; Further participation is typically only possible through &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a reply&lt;/span&gt; that has to undergo &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a similar&lt;/span&gt; slow process. &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A decentralized&lt;/span&gt; authoring application such as &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority&quot; href=&quot;http://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;dokieli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-19&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt; instead allows researchers to self-publish their manuscripts online in their own &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;Solid pod.&lt;/span&gt; Their peers can annotate these manuscripts with comments and reviews, which are stored in their own pods, guaranteeing freedom of expression to any researcher who wants to participate. All outcomes of this process are online, and the scientific community can continuously provide feedback, even after publication on &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;A decentralized&lt;/span&gt; Web for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all-p-1&quot;&gt;Re-decentralizing the Web along the lines of the Solid vision can help us tackle &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee’s three challenges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. We can take back control of our personal data by storing data in our own &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data pods.&lt;/span&gt; The spread of misinformation can be halted, because &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a free&lt;/span&gt; choice of applications allows us to influence our news feed—&lt;wbr/&gt;and all information in there can be traced back to its source. Political advertising becomes more transparent, as we can decide which parts of our data we expose to whom; moreover, the separate data and services markets allow us to consider other options that are not based on advertising in the first place. While this does not fully address all aspects of the challenges, data ownership and choice are &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;major factors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all-p-2&quot;&gt;Freedom of course always comes at &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a cost&lt;/span&gt;: what constitutes &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a victory&lt;/span&gt; for personal rights and freedom of speech also facilitates the spread of illegal messages, since decentralized networks make it harder to control what information is exchanged. Legality is of course &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a tricky&lt;/span&gt; matter, as some countries instate laws that prevent their citizens from voicing opinions that would be legal elsewhere. An intriguing case is the &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2017/08/18/mastodon-is-big-in-japan-the-reason-why-is-uncomfortable/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased popularity of the decentralized social network Mastodon in Japan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-20&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt;: as Twitter started removing images that were deemed questionable under &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt; norms&lt;/span&gt;, Japanese users began publishing them on platforms with less censorship. We will have to accept this &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;trade-off&lt;/span&gt; between freedom and control—&lt;wbr/&gt;and in absence of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a globally&lt;/span&gt; accepted set of norms, centralized filtering of questionable or illegal content can never yield an &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;adequate solution&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all-p-3&quot;&gt;This brings us to another aspect of decentralization, which is the tension between freedom and universality. The Paradox of Freedom states that we can only be free if we subject ourselves to certain rules. Simply said, we can take our bike and ride anywhere—&lt;wbr/&gt;if only we stay on the right side of the road (which in several countries is actually left). Without such rules, we would not be able to get anywhere without causing accidents. Given that &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/0323-yorkshire-tbl/slide5-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;universality has always been &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a main&lt;/span&gt; goal of the Web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-7&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, decentralized communities can only flourish if they agree on some basic framework on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to decentralize. As with the universality of browsers, there is &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a major&lt;/span&gt; role for the &lt;abbr class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt; in creating the standards that will allow decentralized &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;data pods&lt;/span&gt; and apps to interoperate. Fortunately, we do not have to agree on everything. Linked Data enables layered agreements, in which &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a few&lt;/span&gt; rules are adopted by many, and sets of additional rules are agreed upon by smaller groups &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;as needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all-p-4&quot;&gt;Importantly, the arrows of decentralization and Solid are not aimed at specific companies such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter. Instead, they point at centralization in general, since many of the problems and challenges faced by these companies are inherent to centralization and the business model of data ownership. We have come to the point where companies possess so much data that they themselves are &lt;a property=&quot;schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence&quot; href=&quot;https://berjon.com/advertising-war-on-consent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unable to predict the long-term effects that such &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a centralization&lt;/span&gt; might have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-10&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use &lt;q&gt;informed consent&lt;/q&gt; as an excuse, since no individual can reasonably understand what &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;giving up&lt;/span&gt; control over small or large pieces of their data will eventually &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;lead to.&lt;/span&gt; Storing our data in &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a trusted&lt;/span&gt; place of our choice, combined with &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a granular&lt;/span&gt; permission model, is therefore the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;only safe bet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adecentralized-web-for-all-p-5&quot;&gt;Note that none of us are dreaming of &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a Web&lt;/span&gt; without large players. Quite the contrary: Tim Berners-Lee insists that the Web should always remain scale-free &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/#ref-21&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;[21]&lt;/a&gt;, with room for the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;very large&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;very small.&lt;/span&gt; The problem is that the very large are currently trying to make the rest obsolete, which endangers the online freedoms we have enjoyed for &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;so many&lt;/span&gt; years. As argued above, decentralization is foremost about choice, so people should be free to join large or small communities. And while there are several technical issues ahead of us for decentralized applications, notably guaranteeing &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;a similar&lt;/span&gt; user experience as centralized platforms in terms of usability and speed, the first technological proof has been delivered with Solid. Now, it is up to all of us to anchor this technological progress in today’s and tomorrow’s socio-economic reality &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;in order&lt;/span&gt; to re-decentralize the Web for good. Only when we succeed in taking back control and choice over our most precious digital assets, we are able to truly say: &lt;em&gt;this &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;is for everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Re-decentralizing the Web, for good this time</og:title>
<og:description>Originally designed as a decentralized network, the Web has undergone a significant centralization in recent years. In order to regain freedom and control over the digital aspects of our lives, we should understand how we arrived at this point and how we can get back on track…</og:description>

<title>EFF Responds to Bird&amp;#039;s Legal Threats to Boing Boing</title>
<link>https://boingboing.net/2019/01/11/flipping-the-bird.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boingboing.net/2019/01/11/flipping-the-bird.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;82.851128326036&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Last month, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2018/12/08/flipping-a-bird.html&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; discussing the mountains of abandoned Bird Scooters piling up in city impound lots, and the rise of $30 Chinese conversion kits that let you buy a scooter at auction, swap out the motherboard, and turn it into a personal scooter, untethered from the Bird company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-694683&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bird sent us a legal threat of such absurdity that &lt;a href=&quot;https://eff.org/document/bird-rides-takedown-boing-boing-dec-20-2018&quot;&gt;we are publishing it in full&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://eff.org/document/happy-mutants-response-bird-takedown-letter-jan-11-2019&quot;&gt;a scorching response from the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, as a kind of celebration of truly world-class legal foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bird's legal threat, they imply that by linking to a forum in which the existence of conversion kits was under discussion, I had violated the anti-trafficking clauses of Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the 1998 law that limits the dissemination of &quot;circumvention tools&quot; that bypass access controls for copyrighted works -- for example, tools that let you extract the video from an encrypted DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, talking about a place where people are talking about circumvention isn't circumvention or illegal “trafficking” in circumvention technology. The US Copyright Office -- which oversees the DMCA -- publishes a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2018/&quot;&gt;every three years&lt;/a&gt; in which they extensively discuss the existence of circumvention methods. It's just not illegal to talk about circumvention technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hits keep on coming: the conversion kits that I wrote about &lt;em&gt;aren't even circumvention devices&lt;/em&gt;. The DMCA prohibits bypassing technological measures that effectively control access to copyrighted works, and prohibits trafficking in those technologies or technologies that bypass technological measures that prevent infringement. The conversion kits don't bypass a locked bootloader to access or alter the firmware on a Bird Scooter. You get the kit, remove some screws, and put in the new logic board. If motherboard swaps were circumvention, then selling someone a screwdriver could be an offense punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. Obviously, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been doing this for decades, and every year, the number of baseless legal threats from corporations that don't like being criticized goes up. Thin-skinned corporations have always been with us, but the media has never been more vulnerable: cash strapped, underinsured, and easy to frighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't back down. We aren't rich and we aren't powerful, but we know our rights (attentive readers will know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/homepage-feature/cory-doctorows-new-project-apollo-1201&quot;&gt;I've pledged myself to killing Section 1201 of the DMCA&lt;/a&gt; -- you'd be hard pressed to find someone harder to bullshit about DMCA 1201). We've got good friends: the Electronic Frontier Foundation has our back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you get a nastygram like this from Bird? Tell us about it. There's strength in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when Sony's fraudulent copyright claims resulted in a 47 second recording of pianist James Rhodes playing Bach, apologists argued that Sony and Youtube's copyright bots couldn't be expected to tell the difference between a highly skilled Bach performance and the ones in their own catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Demanded T-Mobile, Sprint Not Sell Google Fi Customers&amp;#039; Location Data</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3bnyv/google-demanded-tmobile-sprint-to-not-sell-google-fi-customers-location-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3bnyv/google-demanded-tmobile-sprint-to-not-sell-google-fi-customers-location-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepab8/att-stop-selling-location-data-tmobile-sprint-microbilt-zumigo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced it was stopping the sale&lt;/a&gt; of its customers’ real-time location data to all third parties, in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a Motherboard investigation&lt;/a&gt; showing how data from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint trickled down through a complex network of companies until eventually landing in the hands of bounty hunters and people unauthorized to handle it. To verify the existence of this trade, Motherboard paid $300 on the black market to successfully locate a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, whose Google Fi program offers phone, text, and data services that use T-Mobile and Sprint network infrastructure in the United States, told Motherboard that it asked those companies to not share its customers’ location data with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have never sold Fi subscribers' location information,” a Google spokesperson told Motherboard in a statement late on Thursday. “Google Fi is an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) and not a carrier, but as soon as we heard about this practice, we required our network partners to shut it down as soon as possible.” Google did not say when it made this a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MVNO is essentially a company that provides the usual telecommunication services such as calls and texts, but which uses infrastructure from a telco carrier. Launched in 2015, Fi has international coverage in 170 countries and also offers data only SIMs. Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/project-fi/bringing-google-fi-more-people-android-and-ios/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently announced an expansion of Fi’s availability&lt;/a&gt; to more Android devices as well as iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Motherboard’s investigation, the phone we paid to locate was on the T-Mobile network. The data access traveled through a web of different companies, starting with T-Mobile which sold to a so-called location aggregator named Zumigo. Zumigo then sold the access to Microbilt, a firm which offers phone location services to the bounty hunter industries as well as other sectors. A Microbilt customer then offered a phone lookup to a source, and that source provided Motherboard with a Google Maps screenshot showing the location of the phone itself. The location data was accurate to a range of around 500m, enough to, in our case, correctly point to a specific area of Queens, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile had previously said it was cutting its relationships with location aggregators. In tweets &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1083432593012322304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted in response to Motherboard’s story&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile CEO John Legere reiterated that the company is continuing to ramp down all of its location aggregator contracts, and plans to have this completed by March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint has not responded to Motherboard’s request for comment on whether it plans to mirror the actions of T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and shut down all location aggregator access. Google suggested the telco may be taking some action: Google told Motherboard its partners, namely T-Mobile and Sprint, have already stopped the practice or plan to do so in the coming months (Google clarified to Motherboard that the company told T-Mobile and Sprint to shut down the sale of Fi customers’ data, rather than the telcos’ customers more widely.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got a tip? You can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous, more general statement to Motherboard, a Sprint spokesperson said “Protecting our customers’ privacy and security is a top priority, and we are transparent about that in our Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly share personally identifiable geo-location information except with customer consent or in response to a lawful request such as a validated court order from law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time telcos have said they will take action against location aggregators. Last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evk484/securus-law-enforcement-track-phones-senator-wyden-letters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Senator Ron Wyden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that an aggregator called LocationSmart was providing data access that ultimately allowed low level law enforcement to track down phones without a warrant. In response, AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint cut access to Securus, the company that was acting as a middleman between LocationSmart and the end users. Since then, the telcos have continued to provide location data access for other purposes, such as to roadside assistance firms for locating stranded customers for fraud prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/10/phone-companies-are-selling-your-location-data-now-some-lawmakers-want-federal-investigation/?utm_campaign=BYERS%20MARKET%202019.01.11&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_term=.de418413ff6c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it is winding down its own four remaining location aggregator contracts, which are all with roadside assistance companies. After that, customers will have to give Verizon permission to share their location with the firms. Verizon has not responded to Motherboard’s multiple requests for comment over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motherboard’s investigation showed there is still clear room for abuse with location aggregators. These new steps will, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T say, see them cutting off the sale of location data to all third parties. Multiple senators &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5z74d/senators-harris-warner-wyden-fcc-investigate-att-sprint-tmobile-bounty-hunters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the issue on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the second time in six months, carriers are pledging to stop sharing American’s location with middlemen without their knowledge,” Wyden told Motherboard Thursday. “I’ll believe it when I see it. Carriers are always responsible for who ends up with their customers data—it’s not enough to lay the blame for misuse on downstream companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Michael Atiyah has died</title>
<link>https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/31190</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/31190</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are very sorry to hear of the death of Michael Atiyah. Michael was a giant of mathematics. He held many positions including Savilian Professor of Geometry here in Oxford, President of the Royal Society, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, the founding Directorship of the Isaac Newton Institute and Chancellor of the University of Leicester. From 1997, he was an honorary professor in the University of Edinburgh. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael's work spanned many fields. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology which describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His Atiyah–Singer index theorem, proved with Singer in 1963, not only vastly generalised classical results from the 19th century such as the Riemann-Roch theorem and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the work of his teacher Hodge in the 1930s on harmonic integrals, and also Hirzebruch’s work, but also provided an entirely new bridge between analysis and topology which could also act as a mechanism for giving structure to identities in fields as far apart as number theory and group representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics and coincided with the arrival of Roger Penrose in Oxford. The two exchanged ideas and realised how modern ideas in algebraic geometry formed the appropriate framework for Penrose’s approach to the equations of mathematical physics. This activity came to a head, following a visit of Singer in 1977, when a problem posed by the physicists on the Yang-Mills equations was solved by a mixture of Penrose’s techniques and some recent sophisticated pure mathematics in the theory of holomorphic vector bundles. As his ideas developed MIchael, at the urging of Ed Witten began to consider quantum field theory more seriously and ultimately he became one of the founders of what is loosely called “quantum mathematics”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael gave his time generously in the promotion of his subject. In May 2018 he gave a very entertaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMN5t3tzchI&amp;amp;t=10s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Public Lecture&lt;/a&gt; here in Oxford. His title? 'Numbers are serious but they are also fun.'&lt;/p&gt;
