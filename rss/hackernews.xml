<title>I tried to adjust the time on my alarm clock</title>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2019/02/RaymondChen_5in-150x150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;58&quot; height=&quot;58&quot; alt=&quot;Raymond Chen&quot; class=&quot;avatar avatar-58 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-58 alignnone photo&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;entry-meta&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 4th, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, my alarm clock requires that I install an app on my phone. And the app required me to create an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to repeat that: In order to set my alarm clock, I had to &lt;em&gt;create an account&lt;/em&gt; with the clock manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went through the setup process up back when I bought the alarm clock, and promptly forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the United States went from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time this past weekend, which means that my Sunday morning consisted of walking around the house adjusting the times on the clocks in the house. This is normally a chore that takes just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I got to the alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had uninstalled the ‚ÄúSet the time on the alarm clock‚Äù app because, c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs not like I change the time on the alarm clock every day. I set it once and forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I have to go back and re-download the app. And then I try to connect to the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock doesn‚Äôt respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, go download the manual, figure out how to do a factory reset. The clock now reads 12:00AM, like all clocks do when they are reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the clock set-up again. The app‚Äôs UI is confusing. I can‚Äôt figure out how to re-connect to an existing clock or delete an existing clock so I can re-add it. There is a hamburger button ‚ò∞ next to the clock, but tapping it has no effect. I eventually figure out that you are supposed to swipe on the hamburger button, not tap it. That exposes the garbage can icon üóë for deleting the clock from the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I‚Äôve deleted my clock. Going through factory reset process. But when I enter my Wi-Fi password, the app just hangs with a spinning circle. It appears to be unable to connect to the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent an hour resetting the clock, going through the configuration process again, trying different Wi-Fi networks, resetting my phone, resetting my router, resetting my reset button, nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I was left with a clock that reads ‚Äú12:00AM January 1, 2018‚Äù. We have progressed so much as a society in the past fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that a broken clock is correct twice a day. This one can‚Äôt even manage that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unplugged the clock and put it in the closet. Maybe I‚Äôll try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus chatter&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôm thinking maybe of plugging the clock in at exactly midnight. The date will be wrong, but at least the time will be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue&lt;/strong&gt;: I think the problem is that the clock‚Äôs Wi-Fi chip is broken. It successfully adjusted from standard time to daylight time back in the springtime. But it failed to adjust automatically for the fall changeover. The clock said ‚ÄúNo Wi-Fi‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue 2&lt;/strong&gt;: In the instructions, after ‚ÄúStep 2: Set up with the app‚Äù, there is a ‚ÄúStep 3 (optional)‚Äù that talks about making adjustments. It is not obvious, but step 3 is not dependent upon step 2, and you can use it to set the time without an Internet connection. I never made it past step 2 and therefore never noticed step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wi-Fi connectivity is nice when it‚Äôs working (like it was during the springtime) since it means never having to adjust the time after a power outage or time zone change. There are other features unlocked by Wi-Fi, but we never used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it‚Äôs all moot now because I returned the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not obvious from the box that you need an app to set up the clock. The person who bought the clock did so for the ‚Äúproject the time on the ceiling‚Äù feature, which is a pretty awesome feature. Highly recommended. But maybe not with this clock.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Designing the Facebook Company Brand</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A new brand system designed for clarity, inspired by people.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;By Zach Stubenvoll, Sam Halle, Andrew Stirk and Luke Woods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook started as a single app. Now, 15 years later, we offer a suite of products that help people connect to their friends and family, find communities and grow businesses. These apps and technologies have shared infrastructure for years and the teams behind them frequently work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the next step in our effort to be clearer about the products and services from Facebook. The new company branding is designed to help us better represent the diversity of products we build, establish distinction from the Facebook app and communicate our purpose in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a look into the decisions we made to design our company brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;57.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Collaborative Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how our company builds products, we designed a process to learn, prototype and iterate quickly. We began by building a collective understanding of our company, conducting listening tours with employees and the people and businesses who use our products. We then brought together people from across the company to design and work together. We explored three creative territories, uniting around one final concept inspired by the potential of people when they can come together. We refined the brand system by working with designers across the company to ensure it performs in product, hardware, marketing and physical spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Behaviors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the process, three foundational design behaviors that informed our brand system emerged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt;: a brand that simplifies and builds understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;: a system that is respectful of context and environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating Space&lt;/strong&gt;: design that supports people and their stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Wordmark&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, when people hear ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù they think of the Facebook app. This posed a unique design challenge. We needed the wordmark to establish distinction from the Facebook app and allow for a clearer connection to the full family of technologies. The new brand system uses custom typography, rounded corners, open tracking and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--image brand&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Logo Comparison Animation&quot; src=&quot;https://facebook.design/public/companybrand/2.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing an all-caps treatment as a way to create distinction from the app made it more important to craft unique letterforms. We designed the new company wordmark with clarity and openness in mind. It‚Äôs built on a stable structure through the use of consistent stroke width, harmonized capital letters and a horizontal emphasis. The generous spacing and open letterforms allow clarity at small sizes, and the subtle softening of corners and diagonals adds a sense of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wordmark condenses into a ‚ÄúFB‚Äù monogram in small spaces. This monogram builds on existing equity: FB is already associated with Facebook, is the company‚Äôs stock ticker symbol and is used in domains and employee email addresses. To perform in smaller spaces across product and company touch points, the FB monogram has a heavier weight and extended letterforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--image brand&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Condensed wordmark FB monogram animation&quot; src=&quot;https://facebook.design/public/companybrand/4.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An Empathetic Color Palette&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the company owning a single color, we designed the brand to be responsive to its context and environment. This system allows the wordmark to take on the color of our individual brands, creating a clearer relationship between the company and the products we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--image brand&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wordmark brand color animation&quot; src=&quot;https://facebook.design/public/companybrand/5.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted the brand to connect thoughtfully with the world and the people in it. The dynamic color system does this by taking on the color of its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Motion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use motion in our system to create space for people and their stories. The wordmark itself opens up through tracking and fading, aiming to support and never overshadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Art Direction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand comes to life in the context of people, cultures, communities and relationships. The art direction is designed to capture the emotional connections between people and express a sense of potential when they can come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to be inspired by the communities and people who use our products every day. The brand system was born out of a commitment to be clear, empathetic and create space for people‚Äôs stories to shine through. As the company continues to evolve, we hope this brand can help us better communicate the progress we‚Äôre making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>U of Chicago projected to be the first U.S. university to cost $100k per year</title>

Sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/newsletters/&quot;&gt;our weekly newsletters&lt;/a&gt; to get stories like this delivered directly to your inbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-container-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img srcset=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago2-2000x0-c-default.jpg 2000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago2-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago2-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 550px) 40vw, 100vw&quot; src=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago2-800x0-c-default.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;college tuition inflation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-text&quot;&gt;Located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of the city‚Äôs South Side, the University of Chicago could be the first college or university in the nation where total advertised cost for an undergraduate breaks $100,000. &lt;span class=&quot;img-byline&quot;&gt;Pete D'Amato/The Hechinger Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO ‚Äî Butterflies congregated on a bush as Griffin Badalamente walked past the carefully cultivated lawns and flowers on the University of Chicago campus. In addition to its reputation as an international powerhouse in the field of economics and a home to multiple Nobel Laureates, the school has grounds that are designated as an official botanic garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The privilege of attending is costly, at $57,642 for the 2019-20 academic year. It‚Äôs already one of the most expensive colleges in the country. But in less than a decade, by 2025, students like Badalamente could expect to pay more than $100,000 per year, based on projections by The Hechinger Report using annual college cost growth rates from 2008 to 2018. That would likely make the University of Chicago the first college or university in the United States to break the six-figure mark. Three other schools ‚Äî Harvey Mudd College in California, Columbia University in New York and Southern Methodist University in Texas ‚Äî are projected to cost almost as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not surprising,‚Äù Badalamente said, laughing. The third-year student is studying computational neuroscience and receives a small National Merit scholarship, but otherwise his family pays the full price of attendance. ‚ÄúMy parents make enough money luckily for me to pay the full tuition,‚Äù Badalamente said. Paying more than $100,000 for tuition, fees, books, room and board and other expenses is ‚Äúmore money than it should cost, but I guess if it‚Äôs subsidizing people who wouldn‚Äôt have that opportunity, I feel a little bit better about it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students like Badalamente and their families are key to a tuition strategy that began in the offices of small, liberal arts colleges, but which has now conquered the enrollment offices of most private four-year schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/12/11/higher-ed-inflation-notches-28-percent-2018&quot;&gt;rising education costs&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/like-their-students-colleges-are-vastly-increasing-the-amount-they-borrow/&quot;&gt;amenities and luxury housing&lt;/a&gt; have played a role in pressing up the cost of college attendance, a great deal of college tuition inflation has been driven by an enrollment strategy that relies heavily on tuition discounting. With it, schools identify families willing and able to pay their advertised tuition or ‚Äústicker price‚Äù through savings or loans, and use them to balance out the costs of students who would be more likely to enroll at other institutions due to financial concerns or academic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is also known as price-discrimination ‚Äî in which prices change based on who is paying and when ‚Äî and has long been used to sell goods and services. It is why we are told to buy plane tickets three months before we want to take a flight. But unlike airlines, which may increase prices once the plane is nearly full and seats are harder to come by, colleges strategically drop their prices in order to get enough students to show up each fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article-quote new-pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;article-quote-h js-article-quote-h&quot;&gt;‚ÄúStudents ‚Äî low-income, underrepresented minority ‚Äî still look at sticker price. Even though institutions will say, ‚ÄòNo, no, you probably won‚Äôt pay that.‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article-quote-attr&quot;&gt;Ann Gansemer-Topf, associate professor of education at Iowa State University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, tuition discounting can help admissions officers shape undergraduate classes to include more low-income students and students of color. But a study published this year by Luke Behaunek, now dean of students at Simpson College, and Ann Gansemer-Topf, associate professor at Iowa State University, questioned the strategy‚Äôs effectiveness. Looking at data from 2003 and 2012 for 448 small private colleges, it found that higher tuition discounts did not correlate with increased low-income or minority student enrollment. In fact, instead of going to high-tuition, high-discount institutions, low-income and minority students became concentrated in schools with the lowest discount rates. The schools that increased their rates of discounting most over the period studied failed to bring in more low-income or minority students than the other institutions in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúStudents ‚Äî low-income, underrepresented minority ‚Äî still look at sticker price,‚Äù Gansemer-Topf said. ‚ÄúEven though institutions will say, ‚ÄòNo, no, you probably won‚Äôt pay that.‚Äô ‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for colleges to manage the complex financial math behind tuition discounting, many have turned to enrollment management companies that provide software to game out their strategies. Ironically, one such firm, Ruffalo Noel Levitz, found that the tuition discounting strategy its products make possible is creating a barrier to enrollment for many of the students it is supposed to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-container-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img srcset=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago1-2000x0-c-default.jpg 2000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago1-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago1-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 550px) 40vw, 100vw&quot; src=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago1-800x0-c-default.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;college tuition inflation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-text&quot;&gt;The University of Chicago moved its economics department into the former home of the Chicago Theological Seminary. The Saieh Hall for Economics, which also houses the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics, opened in 2014. &lt;span class=&quot;img-byline&quot;&gt;Pete D'Amato/The Hechinger Report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2016 survey of rising seniors and their parents by the firm found that half of respondents said they would never consider a school with high tuition. In fact, higher-performing students were more likely than average students to rule out colleges with a high price tag ‚Äî by 52 percent to 47 percent. Asian students were the most likely to refuse a school with pricier tuition out of hand, at 58 percent, followed by African American students at 53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the University of Chicago, the percentage of first-time freshman undergraduates who receive Pell Grants, federal financial aid for low-income students, fell from 15 percent in the 2010-11 academic year to 10 percent in 2016-17, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, even as students were paying thousands less in tuition as a result of increased tuition discounting. The number of U.S. students of color enrolling as first-time freshmen in the fall did rise slightly, from 39 percent to 41 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/eligible-for-financial-aid-almost-one-third-of-students-never-get-it/&quot;&gt;Eligible for financial aid, nearly a million students never get it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuition discounting not only fails to support loftier goals like diversifying a campus. There are signs that it has put less-competitive institutions in a bind, as not all universities have the demand that schools such as Chicago do. To hit their enrollment targets, many less-competitive schools discount tuition until the advertised price becomes virtually meaningless. In 2006, federal data showed that 91 four-year colleges and universities reported awarding institutional aid to all of their first-year students, meaning that no freshman was paying the advertised tuition at the school. By 2016, there were 316 schools where no incoming freshman paid the sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While need-based aid has existed in the U.S. for nearly as long as there have been universities, in the past, most of those grants came from existing pots of money held by the universities, such as endowment income, or were tied to gifts from individual donors. Kalamazoo College is one of the schools where the practice of tuition discounting began, back in the 1980s. David Breneman was president of the small liberal arts school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAt that time, on the ledger on the revenue side, if a school had a thousand students enrolled they treated that as if they had a thousand full-pay students,‚Äù said Breneman. ‚ÄúThen on the expense side, they had a category for financial aid.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of financial aid would be drawn up when the budgets were set before the beginning of the academic year. But by the next spring, Breneman said, his admissions office would inevitably find a few dozen students at risk of transferring or dropping out over financial concerns. The U.S. was going through a demographic shift similar to the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/college-students-predicted-to-fall-by-more-than-15-after-the-year-2025/&quot;&gt;worrying small colleges today&lt;/a&gt;, as the declining birth rate in the 1960s meant that there were fewer 18-year-olds in the 1980s. Lowered demand made filling seats harder. An economist by training, Breneman calculated that if a couple thousand dollars in financial aid could secure nearly $9,000 in tuition by enrolling a new student or retaining one at risk of leaving, it made financial sense. He found the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;placeholder-caption&quot;&gt;¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThen my business officer, when the books were closed, would beat me up for breaking the financial aid budget,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I would apologize and say, ‚ÄòOh my god, I‚Äôll never do it again.‚Äô And of course we did it again every year.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/new-data-show-some-colleges-are-definitively-unaffordable-for-many/&quot;&gt;New data show some colleges are definitively unaffordable for many&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Breneman was working independently at Kalamazoo, similar schemes were being informally implemented at other private nonprofit colleges. Breneman would go on to write a book entitled ‚ÄúLiberal Arts Colleges: Thriving, Surviving, or Endangered?‚Äù that laid out a model for how colleges could think of these unfunded grants strategically and economically. ‚ÄúIf there was any point to do what I did in my book it was to argue that, for these small colleges ‚Äî well, any college with a shortage of students relative to the demand they want to fill ‚Äî you‚Äôre just discounting,‚Äù Breneman said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kid yourself that you‚Äôre doing anything else.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuition discounting spread through higher education as a way to entice students who might otherwise be reluctant to pay full price. But to be able to afford giving out those deals, colleges and universities had to raise tuition. The complex math behind their soaring prices did not just ruffle the feathers of college financial officers. President George H. W. Bush‚Äôs Department of Justice began an antitrust probe of dozens of colleges in 1989 that compared tuition discounting strategies to anticompetitive price-fixing. Then, in 1997, Congress established a National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education to investigate the reasons for increasingly high tuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article-quote new-pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;article-quote-h js-article-quote-h&quot;&gt;‚ÄúAre you emailing them? Are you visiting them? Colleges are trying to get a sense of, OK, if you‚Äôre really interested they may need to offer you less money.‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article-quote-attr&quot;&gt;Robert Kelchen, author of ‚ÄúHigher Education Accountability‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of institutional aid, according to the commission, had &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED416762.pdf&quot;&gt;increased 178 percent between 1987 and 1996&lt;/a&gt;. The commission took a look at six possible reasons for college tuition inflation, including the increasing availability of federal student loans, and found that ‚Äúthere is slightly stronger evidence that increases in institutional aid have been one of the cost and price drivers‚Äù of tuition. ‚Äú[I]t seems reasonable to conclude that tuitions could have increased slightly less had institutions not been putting these revenues into institutional aid.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of discounting has been aided by new technology. In the past, figuring out which students were ‚Äúlocks‚Äù ‚Äî certain to enroll regardless of price ‚Äî and which needed a sweetener in the form of aid, required scraps of data and some judgment. In his book, Breneman wrote of a clever method that one school used to determine a student‚Äôs commitment to attending the school ‚Äî and thus how much or how little aid was necessary ‚Äî in which the school sent prospective students postcards asking them to rank their top choices for college. If the institution was lower in the rankings, that meant it would need to deliver more aid, or give up on this student altogether. Software now uses the data schools have on applicants to help predict how much aid must be distributed in order to achieve enrollment targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-container-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img srcset=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago4-2000x0-c-default.jpg 2000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago4-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w, https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago4-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 550px) 40vw, 100vw&quot; src=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DamatoChicago4-800x0-c-default.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;college tuition inflation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-text&quot;&gt;The $81 million Joe and Rika Mansueto Library opened in 2011. The Helmut Jahn-designed building was funded in part by a $25 million donation from its namesake donors. &lt;span class=&quot;img-byline&quot;&gt;Pete D'Amato/The Hechinger Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere are some pretty sophisticated algorithms that ‚Äî based on the financial information, academics, how much interest you‚Äôve shown in the college ‚Äî will give you a pretty good idea of what someone is willing to pay,‚Äù said economist Robert Kelchen, author of ‚ÄúHigher Education Accountability.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you emailing them? Are you visiting them? Colleges are trying to get a sense of, OK, if you‚Äôre really interested they may need to offer you less money.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When demand is high enough that families who can afford it will pay virtually any price, discounting schemes can reduce tuition costs for other students to rock-bottom prices even as the school‚Äôs revenue remains robust. That is true for the University of Chicago, which first-year student Ella Cornwell from California chose over less-pricey University of California schools. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an only child, my mom‚Äôs an only child, so her parents have had a college fund for me since the day I was born,‚Äù said Cornwell, who nonetheless received some aid based on her parents‚Äô income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 37 percent of Chicago undergraduates pay the full price by enrolling without some form of institutional grants, federal aid like Pell Grants or outside scholarships that cover all or part of tuition and expenses, according to federal data. But incoming freshmen from families earning less than $75,000 per year paid an average of less than $5,000 in total costs for the 2016-17 academic year. For families making between $75,001 and $110,000, average total expenses were $15,458. For the wealthiest families, those making over $110,000, the average total cost was roughly $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe University of Chicago is one of the few universities that provides truly comprehensive financial support,‚Äù a spokesperson for the university said. ‚ÄúUChicago admits U.S. students without regard to their financial need, meets the full financial need of all students who are admitted, and does not expect students to take out any loans. We have eliminated student loans from need-based financial aid packages, which has dramatically reduced student debt upon graduation.‚Äù*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university is certainly spending the money it‚Äôs brought in. It dedicated a new $81 million library ‚Äî with less than a third of its cost funded by the building‚Äôs namesake donors ‚Äî in 2011, adding its gleaming, postmodern-domed reading room to the campus‚Äô Gothic and Brutalist edifices. It added a new 800-student residence hall and dining commons, to house students for the two years they are required to live on campus. It also manages a staff that receives more than $1 billion in salary, $230 million of which is for its roughly 1,350 instructional staff and faculty, according to federal data for 2017-18. Producing and employing &lt;a href=&quot;https://hechingerreport.org/higher-salaries-for-breaking-bad-in-the-classroom/&quot;&gt;Nobel laureates&lt;/a&gt; does not come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For less-elite schools, discounting can still bring some benefits, according to the paper from Behaunek and Gansemer-Topf. The average net tuition revenue per student at the small private colleges in their study grew by about 1.26 percent per year after adjusting for the increase in costs of instruction. That growth, along with concerns about signaling weakness to prospective students or losing control over enrollments, has kept many schools from scaling back discounting and lowering tuition prices. For Gansemer-Topf, the question is less about whether to use discounting, and more about thinking critically about its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúInstitutions can‚Äôt just increase tuition because ‚ÄòWe have to look good, we have to stay competitive,‚Äô ‚Äù said Gansemer-Topf. ‚ÄúAre those assumptions current?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hechinger Report calculated future sticker prices for four-year institutions by using data on compound annual growth rates in total cost of attendance from 2008 to 2018, obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics, and projecting those numbers to the academic year beginning in fall 2025. The University of Chicago is projected to reach $103,248 by 2025 based on previous growth rates and its current tuition. Three other schools had a projected sticker price of $100,000 or more. Harvey Mudd College in California is projected to reach $102,508, while Columbia University in New York and Southern Methodist University in Texas are projected to reach roughly $100,000. (The Hechinger Report is based at, but editorially independent from, Teachers College at Columbia University.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Algebraic Structures: Things I wish someone had explained about FP</title>
<link>https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/</guid>
<description>&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of a four-part series: &lt;em&gt;Things I wish someone had explained to me about functional programming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algebraic Structures are something I wish I‚Äôd understood better, sooner. I had a hazy idea of what they were, but didn‚Äôt know the correct terminology. That was a massive barrier to finding out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatisanalgebraicstructure&quot;&gt;What is an algebraic structure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an algebraic structure? Well, according to Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an &lt;strong&gt;algebraic structure&lt;/strong&gt; on a set &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; (called &lt;strong&gt;carrier set&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;underlying set&lt;/strong&gt;) is a collection of finitary operations on &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;; the set &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; with this structure is also called an &lt;strong&gt;algebra&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/#fn:1&quot; id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; title=&quot;see footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt help much. Sets? Finitary operations? What does that have to do with writing code? We‚Äôre trying to learn about functional &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt; here. What do algebraic structures have to do with anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let me ask you a question. Have you ever been around more experienced functional programmers? Ever heard them throwing around a bunch of inscrutable jargon? Words like ‚Äòmonoid,‚Äô ‚Äòapplicative,‚Äô 'semiring,‚Äô ‚Äòlattice,‚Äô ‚Äòfunctor,‚Äô or the dreaded ‚Äòmonad‚Äô? Ever wondered what all that was about? The collective term for these concepts is &lt;em&gt;algebraic structures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to figure this out. And even once I did, it didn‚Äôt help as much as I‚Äôd hoped. In IT, there‚Äôs always someone ready to criticise incorrect terminology. They‚Äôre like hyenas waiting to jump on an unguarded kill. And the functional programming community is no exception. Knowing the name ‚Äòalgebraic structure‚Äô helps protect yourself from that. But not much else. If you do a web search for ‚Äòalgebraic structures‚Äô, you won‚Äôt get helpful results back. And qualifying it with ‚ÄòJavaScript algebraic structures‚Äô doesn‚Äôt improve things much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a reason for the paltry search results. But we‚Äôll come back to that in a later article. For now, let‚Äôs try and understand what algebraic structures are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve read this far, perhaps you‚Äôve read some of my earlier articles. To be specific, the ones about &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/marvellously-mysterious-javascript-maybe-monad/&quot;&gt;Maybe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/elegant-error-handling-with-the-js-either-monad/&quot;&gt;Either&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2018/how-to-deal-with-dirty-side-effects-in-your-pure-functional-javascript/&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/a&gt; (also known as ‚ÄòIO‚Äô). We use Maybe, Either, and Effect for different purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; helps us deal with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; values;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;em&gt;Either&lt;/em&gt; to handle errors; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effect&lt;/em&gt; gives us control over side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each one serves a useful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also notice that we often create them using objects. And these objects have methods with names in common. For example, Maybe, Either, and Effect all have a &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method. Each one also has &lt;code&gt;.ap()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.of()&lt;/code&gt; methods. And all three have &lt;code&gt;.chain()&lt;/code&gt; too. This is not a coincidence. They‚Äôre following a pattern‚Äîthree patterns, to be precise. And these patterns are (you guessed it) &lt;em&gt;algebraic structures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they? You may have come across &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern&quot;&gt;design patterns&lt;/a&gt; before. They describe, well, &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt; that we see repeated in code. According to Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Design patterns are] not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software design patterns were popularised by a bunch of smart people. They observed common approaches to programming problems and then wrote books about it. Like design patterns, algebraic structures also represent templates for solving a problem. And they can be used in many different situations. &lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; design patterns though, algebraic structures have their basis is in mathematics. They‚Äôre not based on general observation alone. In practice, this means that they tend to be more formally defined and more general. They also have specific laws they must conform to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter to intuition, the laws don‚Äôt make algebraic structures more restrictive. Instead, they tend to be the kind of thing you look at and think ‚Äúwell, duh‚Äù. But having them there means that we can make deductions and assumptions about how the code works. And that in turn allows us to make optimisations and refactor code safely. Even better, we can write tools that will make the computer do those for us. But we‚Äôll come back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;algebraicstructuresinjavascript&quot;&gt;Algebraic Structures in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a look at algebraic structures in JavaScript. We have a specification for algebraic structures called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Fantasy Land&lt;/a&gt;. It assumes that we‚Äôre going to write our algebraic structures using classes and objects. (Though, that‚Äôs not the only way to do it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each structure, the specification lists methods an object must have to comply. The methods must also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conform to a specific type signature (even though it‚Äôs JavaScript); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obey some laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don‚Äôt recommend going and reading the specification. It‚Äôs written for library authors, not for regular programmers.&lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/#fn:2&quot; id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; title=&quot;see footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The explanations there don‚Äôt explain what the structures are &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;. That is, the specification doesn‚Äôt tell you what problems the structures solve. But it does tell us the laws for each structure, and gives us a consistent naming convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in Fantasy Land, an algebraic structure is an object. But the object has to have some specific methods. Those methods must match a given naming convention and specific type signatures. And each method also has to obey some laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds super abstract, I know. The definition is kind of dry and boring. Bear with me. What we can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with algebraic structures is much more interesting. Let‚Äôs look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thefunctoralgebraicstructure&quot;&gt;The functor algebraic structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòFunctor‚Äô is an algebraic structure‚Äîoften the first one people learn. The functor structure must have a &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method with the following type signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;map :: Functor f =&amp;gt; f a ~&amp;gt; (a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; f b
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve written the signature above in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-style/#hindley-milnertypesignatures&quot;&gt;Hindley‚ÄìMilner notation&lt;/a&gt; Fantasy Land uses. In TypeScript, it might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;interface Functor&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {
    map&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;(f: (a: A) =&amp;gt; B): Functor&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs break that down. Both type signatures say something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method takes a function as an argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That function must take something of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and transforms it into something of type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. The types &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be anything‚Äîeven the same type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And when you call &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; on a functor of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, you‚Äôll get back a functor of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve read about Maybe, Either, and Effect, this will be familiar. This &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method takes an ordinary function and makes it work with functors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs more to the specification though. Functor has two laws, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is a functor, then calling &lt;code&gt;u.map(x =&amp;gt; x)&lt;/code&gt; must be equivalent to &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;. This is the ‚Äòidentity law.‚Äô&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is a functor, and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; are functions, then calling &lt;code&gt;u.map(x =&amp;gt; f(g(x)))&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to calling &lt;code&gt;u.map(g).map(f)&lt;/code&gt;. This is the ‚Äòcomposition law.‚Äô&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our class (or object) satisfies all these criteria, then we can call it a functor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that Array has a &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method. And if you care to check, you‚Äôll find that it obeys the functor laws. Hence it‚Äôs safe to declare Array a functor. But Array is not the only functor. As discussed, Maybe, Either, and Effect are functors too. They each have a &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method and they obey the laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functor isn‚Äôt the only algebraic structure either. There‚Äôs a bunch of them. You can read all the method names, type signatures and laws in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Fantasy Land Specification&lt;/a&gt;. But, as mentioned, I don‚Äôt recommend starting there. Instead, check out Tom Harding‚Äôs excellent series: ‚Äò&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomharding.me/fantasy-land/&quot;&gt;Fantas, Eel, and Specification&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äô It runs through specific examples of how to use algebraic structures in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatsthepointofalgebraicstructures&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the point of algebraic structures?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you made it through all that without nodding off, I commend you. And you may well be wondering, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô Why do we care that someone wrote down a bunch of rules in a specification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs a good question. Because, on their own, these algebraic structures don‚Äôt do much of anything. Sure, they might be interesting to mathematicians. But what good are they to working programmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as we said, algebraic structures don‚Äôt do much of anything on their own. They‚Äôre just abstract descriptions. It‚Äôs not until we create &lt;em&gt;instances&lt;/em&gt; like Maybe, Either or Effect that we can do anything useful. And we don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a specification to make these work. It would be no trouble to call &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; another name. For example, we could rename &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.try()&lt;/code&gt; for Either and Maybe. It might be easier to understand that way. Or change Array‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; method to &lt;code&gt;.select()&lt;/code&gt;. There‚Äôs nothing special about the names. So what does a specification for algebraic structures give us? Why bother conforming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a step back with me and consider something. Notice that we called Maybe, Either, and Effect &lt;em&gt;instances&lt;/em&gt; of algebraic structures. That‚Äôs a bit odd. Maybe, Either, and Effect are classes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/#fn:3&quot; id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; title=&quot;see footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs unusual to talk about classes as instances. It‚Äôs more common to talk about &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; as instances of a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;. Classes are normally the abstraction, and objects are the concrete &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; we use to get stuff done. But we‚Äôve started talking about &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; as an instance of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs think about that. Why do we use classes for anything? Because they abstract common behaviour. That behaviour is shared between a bunch of objects. Algebraic structures, in turn, abstract common patterns shared between a bunch of classes. At least, that‚Äôs one way to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this help us? In two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Algebraic structures help us in the same way all other abstractions help us. They hide some detail so we can think clearly about the bigger picture. Once you learn a handful of instances like Array, Maybe, Effect, etc. then you begin to see the pattern. That makes it easier to learn other instances that share the same pattern. And it gives us a precise way to communicate with other programmers. Clarity of thought and precise communication. There‚Äôs legitimate value here, regardless of how hand-wavy it might sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There‚Äôs more concrete benefits too though. We said earlier that algebraic structures are based in mathematics. We can make that math do work for us. The specifications include laws‚Äîmathematical laws. We can take advantage of those laws to make the computer derive code for us. Compilers can use those laws to optimise our code. And do so with mathematical certainty that we‚Äôll still get the same result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second point is worth exploring further. Let‚Äôs try it out with Functor. One of the functor laws is the composition law. It says that mapping twice is the same as mapping a function composed of two other functions. That is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;// Here, ‚â£ is an operator I‚Äôve made up to signify ‚Äòis equivalent to‚Äô
a.map(g).map(f) ‚â£ a.map(x =&amp;gt; f(g(x)))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an array with millions of elements. Both sides of the equation above will produce a result. But the one on the left will be slower and use a lot more memory. That‚Äôs because most JS engines will create an intermediate array for &lt;code&gt;a.map(g)&lt;/code&gt; before mapping &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. On the right-hand side though, we do all the calculations in a single pass. Let‚Äôs assume we know for certain that &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; are pure functions. In that case, a compiler can swap the left side for the right with complete safety. We get performance improvements ‚Äòfor free‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can have the computer derive functions for us. For example, imagine we‚Äôre working with modern JS. Our Array prototypes have &lt;code&gt;.flatMap()&lt;/code&gt; defined. And &lt;code&gt;.flatMap()&lt;/code&gt; looks eerily similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/blob/master/README.md#chain-method&quot;&gt;Fantasy Land‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;.chain()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Similar enough that we can treat them as equivalent. And because &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt;, the algebraic structures let us derive another function, &lt;code&gt;ap()&lt;/code&gt;, ‚Äòfor free‚Äô. One implementation might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;function ap(m) {
    return m.flatMap(f =&amp;gt; this.map(f));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this implementation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/blob/master/README.md#derivations&quot;&gt;stolen from the Fantasy Land specification&lt;/a&gt;) has a &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; in it. That means we‚Äôre supposed to attach it to the prototype of our class. For an array that would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;Array.prototype.ap = function ap(m) {
    return m.flatMap(f =&amp;gt; this.map(f));
};
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a big no no. Modifying the prototypes of built-in objects is dangerous. It‚Äôs kind of like nuclear weapons. It‚Äôs fine, as long as nobody else uses them. But as soon there‚Äôs a chance of other people using them, then we‚Äôre all in danger. Who knows when someone might blow us all up? Hence we all agree not to muck around with that kind of thing. And that‚Äôs OK, because we can attach &lt;code&gt;.ap()&lt;/code&gt; to any individual array we want. It won‚Äôt bother anybody else (as long as you‚Äôre not using IE6). Or, we can use &lt;code&gt;Function.prototype.call&lt;/code&gt; to tell the computer what &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; should be. That might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;const bases = ['ice cream', 'banana', 'strawberry'];
const toppings = ['nuts', 'chocolate sauce', 'sprinkles'];
const combine = a =&amp;gt; b =&amp;gt; `${a} with ${b}`;
const basesWith = bases.map(combine);
const combos = ap.call(toppings, basesWith);
console.log(combos);
// [&quot;ice cream with nuts&quot;, &quot;ice cream with chocolate sauce&quot;, &quot;ice cream with sprinkles&quot;, &quot;banana with nuts&quot;, &quot;banana with chocolate sauce&quot;, &quot;banana with sprinkles&quot;, &quot;strawberry with nuts&quot;, &quot;strawberry with chocolate sauce&quot;, &quot;strawberry with sprinkles&quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Fantasy Land specification calls this &lt;code&gt;.flatMap()&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;.chain()&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, we lose a little bit of interoperability there. But that‚Äôs OK too. It‚Äôs not hard to adjust the derivation so that it could work with either name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;function chainOrFlatMap(x) {
    return (typeof x.chain === 'function')   ? x.chain.bind(x)   :
           (typeof x.flatMap === 'function') ? x.flatMap.bind(x) :
           () =&amp;gt; {throw new Error('We received an object that doesn‚Äôt have chain or flatMap defined')};
}

function ap(m) {
    return chainOrFlatMap(m)(f =&amp;gt; this.map(f));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the point of this though? We wrote that function ourselves. The computer didn‚Äôt write it for us. That‚Äôs true. But some other languages have better support for algebraic structures. And in those languages the compiler &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; write that code for you. And yet, even though we wrote that code ourselves, it‚Äôs still useful. Notice that there‚Äôs nothing specific to arrays or Maybe or Either or anything else in that code. All it needs is &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.flatMap()&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;.chain()&lt;/code&gt;). This code will work with anything that implements those methods and obeys the laws. &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;. It will work for arrays, Either, Maybe, Effect, Future, and so on. &lt;em&gt;With no change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets better though. Because we can then write our own functions that use &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.ap()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.chain()&lt;/code&gt;. If those methods are all we rely on, our new functions will work anywhere too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write once. Run in a bunch of different scenarios. That‚Äôs the promise of algebraic structures. Need a function to run even if we might have to deal with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;? Stick it in a Maybe. Need a function that works with a value that we don‚Äôt have yet? Perhaps it will come back from an HTTP request some time in the future. No problem, stick it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt;. Need precise control over when side-effects happen? The same code will work in an Effect too. Plus ‚Äòfree‚Äô performance optimisations and other pre-written code. Algebraic structures make all this possible. Hence why they called the algebraic structure specification for JavaScript ‚ÄòFantasy Land‚Äô. It sounds, well, like a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wherearealltheblogposts&quot;&gt;Where are all the blog posts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If algebraic structures are so fantastic though, where are all the blog posts? Why doesn‚Äôt a search for ‚Äòalgebraic structures‚Äô turn up hundreds of articles? Where are all the programmers talking about how wonderful algebraic structures are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lots of blog posts about how wonderful algebraic structures are. But there‚Äôs a couple of reasons why they don‚Äôt show up in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people write about algebraic structures but don‚Äôt call them that. Instead, they‚Äôll use one structure to stand in for all structures. For example, they might write a post or give a talk about why monads are great. Or how wonderful functors are. And that‚Äôs fine. But it means fewer articles about algebraic structures showing up in search engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authors of these posts tend to come from languages like Haskell, PureScript, and Scala. These languages have an alternate way of creating algebraic structures. They don‚Äôt use classes and objects. Instead, they use something called ‚Äòtype classes'. And you‚Äôll find plenty of tutorials on how great type classes are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in the next article, we‚Äôll talk about type classes. Stay tuned‚Ä¶ In the meantime, please do go and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomharding.me/fantasy-land/&quot;&gt;Tom Harding‚Äôs series on Fantasy Land&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enormous thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jethrolarson&quot;&gt;Jethro Larson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joelmccracken&quot;&gt;Joel McCracken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kurtmilam&quot;&gt;Kurt Milam&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing an earlier draft of this entire series. I really appreciate the feedback and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Algebraic Structures are something I wish I‚Äôd understood better, sooner. I had a hazy idea of what they were, but didn‚Äôt know the correct terminology. That was a massive barrier to finding out more. This article is my attempt to stop that happening to others. We'll look at: What are algebraic structures? How do we use them in JavaScript? Why would we bother? What's the big deal?</og:description>

<title>L.A. temporarily suspends Uber‚Äôs permit to rent out electric scooters and bikes</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-04/los-angeles-suspends-uber-jump-scooters-bikes-data-privacy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-04/los-angeles-suspends-uber-jump-scooters-bikes-data-privacy</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Following months of conflict over a &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-scooter-surveillance-privacy-20190315-story.html&quot;&gt;controversial data-sharing policy&lt;/a&gt;, Los Angeles has temporarily suspended Uber‚Äôs permit to rent electric scooters and bicycles on city streets and sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company‚Äôs subsidiary, Jump, must appeal the decision by Friday or leave the city, the Transportation Department told the company in a letter last week. For now, customers can still rent the vivid red scooters and electric bikes through the Jump app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Uber threatened in a letter to sue the city over the ‚Äúpatently unfair and improper‚Äù suspension. The letter also questioned the validity of the ‚Äúeleventh-hour administrative review process‚Äù that the city created last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEvery other company that is permitted in Los Angeles is following the rules,‚Äù said Transportation Department spokeswoman Connie Llanos. ‚ÄúWe look forward to being able to work with Uber on getting them into compliance.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension follows months of tension and failed attempts at compromise between Uber and the city over a data-sharing rule in L.A.'s &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-scooter-vote-20180904-story.html&quot;&gt;one-year pilot permit program&lt;/a&gt;. Companies are required to transmit real-time data on all trips made within the city, including the start point, end point and travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber has resisted the rule for months, arguing, with the backing of several data privacy organizations, that the city‚Äôs policy constitutes government surveillance. With minimal analysis, they say, the information could easily reveal where people live, work, socialize or worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles officials have said the data are necessary to figure out which companies are flouting the permit program‚Äôs rules, including caps on the number of vehicles and bans on riding in certain areas. They have also argued that the companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight companies with permits to operate in L.A. ‚Äî including Uber, Bird, Lime and Lyft ‚Äî manage a fleet of about 32,000 scooters and bikes that see about 1 million trips per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute highlights the lack of trust between cities and transportation companies that have typically moved into new markets without asking permission, working with local officials or sharing details on their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Uber ‚Äúgenerate and collect massive amounts of personal and financial data,‚Äù while the city ‚Äúdoes not collect information specific to individual riders beyond trip information,‚Äù said Marcel Porras, the Transportation Department‚Äôs chief sustainability officer, in a letter to Uber last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data-sharing policies crafted in Los Angeles are now being overseen by a nonprofit organization, the &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Mobility Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Its advocates hope the rules will serve as a framework to standardize data-sharing between governments and transportation companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Transportation Department has &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M269/K191/269191186.PDF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;urged California regulators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to adopt a similar framework for trips made in Uber and Lyft cars, which would reveal vast amounts of information on their operations statewide ‚Äî data &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uber-tax-los-angeles-20190226-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cities badly want to review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, but that the companies have zealously guarded.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Got Access to My Secret Consumer Score</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As consumers, we all have ‚Äúsecret scores‚Äù: hidden ratings that determine how long each of us waits on hold when calling a business, whether we can return items at a store, and what type of service we receive. A low score sends you to the back of the queue; high scores get you elite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every so often, journalists lament these systems‚Äô inaccessibility. They‚Äôre ‚Äúlargely invisible to the public,‚Äù The New York Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/business/electronic-scores-rank-consumers-by-potential-value.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. ‚ÄúMost people have no inkling they even exist,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-hold-for-45-minutes-it-might-be-your-secret-customer-score-1541084656&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Most recently, in April, The Journal‚Äôs Christopher Mims looked at a company called Sift, whose proprietary scoring system tracks 16,000 factors for companies like Airbnb and OkCupid. ‚ÄúSift judges whether or not you can be trusted,‚Äù he &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-trust-scores-companies-use-to-judge-us-all-11554523206&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, ‚Äúyet there‚Äôs no file with your name that it can produce upon request.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As of this summer, though, Sift &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a file on you, which it can produce upon request. I got mine, and I found it shocking: More than 400 pages long, it contained all the messages I‚Äôd ever sent to hosts on Airbnb; years of Yelp delivery orders; a log of every time I‚Äôd opened the Coinbase app on my iPhone. Many entries included detailed information about the device I used to do these things, including my IP address at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sift knew, for example, that I‚Äôd used my iPhone to order chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosas and garlic naan on a Saturday night in April three years ago. It knew I used my Apple laptop to sign into Coinbase in January 2017 to change my password. Sift knew about a nightmare Thanksgiving I had in California‚Äôs wine country, as captured in my messages to the Airbnb host of a rental called ‚ÄúCloud 9.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe heater in the room with the big couch has been running since we got here and we‚Äôre not sure how to turn it off,‚Äù I wrote on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe air in the main house is really musty, like maybe there‚Äôs a mildew or mold issue,‚Äù I wrote on Thursday, then added apologetically, ‚ÄúSorry to be bothering you on Thanksgiving!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe bathroom flooded during the rainstorm. The carpet outside the bathroom is very wet,‚Äù I wrote on Friday. ‚ÄúAnts are coming in from the interior wall of the house.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This may sound somewhat comical, but the companies gathering and paying for this data find it extremely valuable for rooting out fraud and increasing the revenue they can collect from big spenders. Sift has this data because the company has been hired by Airbnb, Yelp, and Coinbase to identify stolen credit cards and help spot identity thieves and abusive behavior. Still, the fact that obscure companies are accumulating information about years of our online and offline behavior is unsettling, and at a minimum it creates the potential for abuse or discrimination ‚Äî particularly when those companies decide we don‚Äôt stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-53006690&quot;&gt;How to get your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There are many companies in the business of scoring consumers. The challenge is to identify them. Once you do, the instructions on getting your data will probably be buried in their privacy policies. Ctrl-F ‚Äúrequest‚Äù is a good way to find it. Most of these companies will also require you to send a photo of your driver‚Äôs license to verify your identity. Here are five that say they‚Äôll share the data they have on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1xx6m9o ez3869y0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-15hwz5e evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sift, which determines consumer trustworthiness, asks you to email &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:privacy@sift.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy@sift.com&lt;/a&gt;. You‚Äôll then have to fill out &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGTJHX9edmQOD8Ez-1NgJP7cbikwLKyAgXl5TYDNAK4mZT9g/viewform&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a Google form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-15hwz5e evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Zeta Global, which identifies people with a lot of money to spend, lets you request your data via &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/bc2d3301-11a5-4de5-b15e-ce796187a352/d0720d0f-d427-4a7d-a773-5d6793229f15.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an online form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-15hwz5e evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Retail Equation, which helps companies such as Best Buy and Sephora decide whether to accept or reject a product return, will send you a report if you email &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:returnactivityreport@theretailequation.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;returnactivityreport@theretailequation.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-15hwz5e evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Riskified, which develops fraud scores, will tell you what data it has gathered on your possible crookedness if you contact &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:privacy@riskified.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy@riskified.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-15hwz5e evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kustomer, a database company that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kustomer.com/platform/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provides&lt;/a&gt; what it calls ‚Äúunprecedented insight into a customer‚Äôs past experiences and current sentiment,‚Äù tells people to email &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:privacy@kustomer.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy@kustomer.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Just because the companies say they‚Äôll provide your data doesn‚Äôt mean they actually will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kustomer, for example, gave me the runaround. When I first contacted the company from my personal email address, a representative wrote back that I would have the report by the end of the week. After a couple of weeks passed, I emailed again and was told the company was ‚Äúinstituting a new process‚Äù and had ‚Äúhit a few snags.‚Äù I never got the report. When I contacted a company spokeswoman, I was told that I would need to get my data instead from the companies that used Kustomer to analyze me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-736832cb&quot;&gt;Thanks, California&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the companies only recently started honoring these requests in response to the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/technology/california-online-privacy-law.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act.&lt;/a&gt; Set to go into effect in 2020, the law will grant Californians the right to see what data a company holds on them. It follows a 2018 European privacy law, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;called General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, that lets Europeans gain access to and delete their online data. Some companies have decided to honor the laws‚Äô transparency requirements even for those of us who are not lucky enough to live in Europe or the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe expect these are the first of many laws,‚Äù said Jason Tan, the chief executive of Sift. The company, founded in 2011, started making files available to ‚Äúall end users‚Äù this June, even where not legally required to do so ‚Äî such as in New York, where I live. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to be more privacy conscious. We want to be good citizens and stewards of the internet. That includes transparency.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I was inspired to chase down my data files by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.representconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019.06.24-FTC-Letter-Surveillance-Scores.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a June report&lt;/a&gt; from the Consumer Education Foundation, which wants the Federal Trade Commission to investigate secret surveillance scores ‚Äúgenerated by a shadowy group of privacy-busting firms that operate in the dark recesses of the American marketplace.‚Äù The report named 11 firms that rate shoppers, potential renters and prospective employees. I pursued data from the firms most likely to have information on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One of the co-authors of the report was Laura Antonini, the policy director at the Consumer Education Foundation. At my suggestion, she sought out her own data. She got a voluminous report from Sift, and like me, had several companies come up empty-handed despite their claims to have information on hundreds of millions of people. Retail Equation, the company that helps decide whether customers should be allowed to make a return, had nothing on me and one entry for Ms. Antonini: a return of three items worth $78 to Victoria‚Äôs Secret in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care that these data analytics companies know I made a return to Victoria‚Äôs Secret in 2009, or that I had chicken kebabs delivered to my apartment, but how is this information being used against me when you generate scores for your clients?‚Äù Ms. Antonini said. ‚ÄúThat is what consumers deserve to know. The lack of the information I received back is the most alarming part of this.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In other words, most of these companies are just showing you the data they used to make decisions about you, not how they analyzed that data or what their decision was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-7fd7b1dc&quot;&gt;‚ÄòIt‚Äôs incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone‚Äô&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;My Sift file didn‚Äôt come with a credit-score-type number at the top, but many of the entries included a percentage rating as to whether the behavior was ‚Äúabuse‚Äù or ‚Äúnot abuse,‚Äù ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúfraud‚Äù or ‚Äúaccount takeover‚Äù versus ‚Äúnot account takeover.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When I told Mr. Tan that I was alarmed to see my Airbnb messages and Yelp orders in the hands of a company I‚Äôd never heard of before, he responded by saying that Sift doesn‚Äôt sell or share any of the data it has with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe are in the business of predicting risks for particular events at particular times, for particular fraud,‚Äù he said. Sift is looking at all my online activity to make sure it‚Äôs me, and not someone trying to impersonate or hack me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúBehind the scenes, we‚Äôre trying to create connections between fraudulent accounts,‚Äù Mr. Tan said. To score risk, the more data Sift has, the better. It‚Äôs able to use what it knows across the accounts of all its clients, so if a certain device has been used to make an order on Yelp with a stolen credit card, Sift can flag that device when it shows up on Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking at the data. It‚Äôs just machines and algorithms doing this work,‚Äù said Mr. Tan. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I asked Mr. Tan how many people had requested their data from Sift since the company introduced the option to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúHonestly, we haven‚Äôt seen much of a response,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A spokeswoman from Zeta Global, which created a portal for data requests in August, told me that 10 people have requested their data so far. ‚ÄúThere was only data on two people,‚Äù she said. (I was one of them; the company had a record of all the comments I had made on a blog a decade ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This may be because most people have no idea Sift, Zeta and the other secret scorers exist. But now you do, and you know how you can get your files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you submit a request to any of these companies and get back something weird, please share your experience with me at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:kashmir.hill@nytimes.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;kashmir.hill@nytimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/energy-environment/oil-supply.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/energy-environment/oil-supply.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;HOUSTON ‚Äî A surge of oil production is coming, whether the world needs it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The flood of crude will arrive even as concerns about climate change are growing and worldwide oil demand is slowing. And it is not coming from the usual producers, but from Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana ‚Äî countries that are either not known for oil or whose production has been lackluster in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This looming new supply may be a key reason Saudi Arabia‚Äôs giant oil producer, Aramco, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/dealbook/aramco-ipo.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;pushed ahead&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday with plans for what could be the world‚Äôs largest initial stock offering ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Together, the four countries stand to add nearly a million barrels a day to the market in 2020 and nearly a million more in 2021, on top of the current world crude output of 80 million barrels a day. That boost in production, along with global efforts to lower emissions, will almost certainly push oil prices down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lower prices could prove damaging for Aramco and many other oil companies, reducing profits and limiting new exploration and drilling, while also reshaping the politics of the nations that rely on oil income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new rise in production is likely to bring economic relief to consumers at the gas pump and to importing nations like China, India and Japan. But cheaper oil may complicate efforts to combat global warming and wean consumers and industries off their dependence on fossil fuels, because lower gasoline prices could, for example, slow the adoption of electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Canada, Norway, Brazil and Guyana are all relatively stable at a time of turbulence for traditional producers like Venezuela and Libya and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Their oil riches should undercut efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to support prices with cuts in production and give American and other Western policymakers an added cushion in case there are renewed attacks on oil tankers or processing facilities in the Persian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Daniel Yergin, the energy historian who wrote ‚ÄúThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Power and Money,‚Äù compared the impact of the new production to the advent of the shale oil boom in Texas and North Dakota a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúSince all four of these countries are largely insulated from traditional geopolitical turmoil, they will add to global energy security,‚Äù Mr. Yergin said. But he also predicted that as with shale, the incremental supply gain, combined with a sluggish world economy, could drive prices lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There is already a glut on the world market, even with exports from Venezuela and Iran sharply curtailed by American sanctions. Should their production come back, that glut would only expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Years of moderate gasoline prices have already increased the popularity of bigger cars and sports utility vehicles in the United States, and the probability of more oil on the market is bound to weigh on prices at the pump over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The oil-supply outlook is a sharp departure from the early 2000s, when prices soared as producers strained to keep up with ballooning demand in China and some analysts warned that the world was running out of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then came the rise of hydraulic fracturing and drilling through tight shale fields, which converted the United States from a needy importer into a powerful exporter. The increase in American production, along with a choppy global economy, shaved oil prices from well over $100 a barrel before the 2007-9 recession to about $56 on Friday for the American benchmark crude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those low prices have forced OPEC and Russia to lower production in recent years, and this year many financially struggling American oil companies have slashed their exploration and production investments to pay down their debts and protect their dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new oil will accelerate those trends, energy experts say, even if only for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThis could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,‚Äù said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics. Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Production of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúLegacy decisions keep going,‚Äù said John Browne, BP‚Äôs former chief executive. ‚ÄúThings happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The added production in Norway comes despite the country‚Äôs embrace of the 2016 Paris climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Equinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, ‚ÄúThe Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Norway‚Äôs rebound from 19 years of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually produce 440,000 barrels a day, increasing the country‚Äôs output from 1.3 million barrels a day to 1.6 million next year and 1.8 million in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year by 300,000 barrels a day, and the country is expected to add as much as 460,000 more barrels a day by the end of 2021. In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much as 15 billion barrels of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Canada, the 1,000-mile Line 3 pipeline that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or about 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will reach 120,000 barrels a day early next year, rising to at least 750,000 barrels by 2025, and more is expected after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Guyana potentially has the most complicated future of the four countries. Its ethnically divided politics are sometimes turbulent, and Venezuela claims a large portion of its territory. But with the oil fields miles offshore, drilling is largely protected. In addition, Venezuela is mired in a political and economic crisis and unlikely to challenge a Chinese state company which has an oil investment in Guyana, along with Exxon Mobil and Hess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Energy experts say the new production from the four nations will more than satisfy all the growth in global demand expected over the next two years, which is well below the growth rates of recent years before economic expansion in China, Europe and Latin America slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the same time, new pipelines in Texas are expected to increase United States exports to 3.3 million barrels a day next year, from the current 2.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That adds up to a vast surplus unless there is a resurgence of global economic growth to stimulate demand, or a prolonged conflict in the Middle East or other disruption to supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúTo support prices, OPEC is going to have to extend and probably deepen their production cuts for a while,‚Äù said David L. Goldwyn, a top State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúGetting the prices up to the point where Aramco can launch its I.P.O. is a big Saudi priority.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new barrels on the world market will also put pressure on companies producing in the United States, where profit margins for shale production are slim at current price levels and stock prices are falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúIf I was in the business I would be scared to death,‚Äù said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. ‚ÄúThe industry is going to face capital starvation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;American oil executives express concern that drilling will fade in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado as oil prices drop to as low as $50 a barrel in the next few years. Small companies are expected to merge, while others go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sngw6j&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;‚ÄòThis Is the Most Lonesome Job‚Äô: Ride With a ‚ÄòHot Shot‚Äô Oilfield Trucker in Texas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;As the United States has become the world‚Äôs largest producer of oil, demand in the fields has soared for pipes or drums in a hurry. That‚Äôs where Mike Wilkinson fits in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of the Texas-based producer Pioneer Natural Resources, said he expected the growth of United States oil production to ease from 1.2 million barrels a day this year to 500,000 barrels next year and perhaps 400,000 barrels in 2021. Those increases are modest compared with the average increase of a million barrels a day every year from 2010 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Sheffield said he was optimistic, in part because new supplies coming to market could be offset by production declines in older fields in Mexico and elsewhere after 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThere are no more big, giant new projects except Guyana,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just have to be patient for a couple of more years.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
