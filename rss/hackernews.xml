<title>Why Do Hospitals Hate Sleep So Much?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/12/why-do-hospitals-hate-sleep-so-much/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;hero is-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;963&quot; height=&quot;557&quot; src=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blog_zuma_yawn.jpg?w=963&amp;amp;is-pending-load=1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-large size-large wp-post-image jetpack-lazy-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Renee C.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Looking for news you can trust?&lt;br/&gt;Subscribe to our free newsletters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;I’ve been hospitalized once in my life, four years ago, and ever since then a very specific question has rattled around my brain, fruitlessly seeking an answer: Why are hospitals designed to allow patients as little sleep as possible?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Is my phrasing a little too aggressive? &lt;em&gt;Designed&lt;/em&gt; to prevent sleep? Maybe that’s going a tiny bit too far. Instead let’s say: Why do the people who design hospitals not give a rat’s ass about patients getting any sleep?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;There. That’s better. And it’s nuts. The whole point of hospitals is to care for sick people, and getting adequate sleep is a critical part of recovery. So why would every part of every hospital be designed without the slightest consideration of sleep? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/upshot/why-hospitals-should-let-you-sleep.html&quot;&gt;I’ll hand the mic over to Austin Frakt for a bit:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Peter Ubel understands the problem as both a physician and patient. When he spent a night in the hospital recovering from surgery in 2013, he was interrupted multiple times by blood draws, vital sign checks, other lab tests, as well as by the beeping of machines. &lt;strong&gt;“Not an hour went by without some kind of disruption,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Dr. Ubel, a physician with Duke University. “It’s a terrible way to start recovery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;….&lt;strong&gt;Solutions aren’t hard to fathom.&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Ubel listed some in 2013. Hospital workers could coordinate so that one disruption serves multiple needs: a blood draw and a vitals check at the same time instead of two hours apart. Or they could allow patients’ needs to guide schedules. If a patient is at low risk and can go six or eight hours without a vitals check, for example, perhaps don’t do that check once every four hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Small changes in hospital routines like these can go a long way. A clinical trial to test them found that they significantly reduced the proportion of patients reporting hospital-related sleep disruptions, and they cut sedative use in half. These small changes can even increase patients’ ratings of hospitals, which are now part of Medicare quality measures. &lt;strong&gt;The key insight seems to be to prioritize patients over tests and other interruptions that can be deferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;As Frakt says, solutions aren’t hard to fathom. In fact, they’re trivially easy to figure out. This is why hospital routines strike me as deliberate negligence: they could only be put in place by administrators who literally don’t care about anything except the convenience of doctors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Is there anything we poor patients can do? It’s hard to say. One time I asked a nurse to turn off the sound on the IV drip, and he actually did try to do it. But apparently he didn’t know how, because it kept beeping all night regardless of whether there was a problem. This does not give me great confidence in the possibility of further noise-reduction measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;FWIW, though, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sometimes possible to get better treatment. After a couple of days during my stay, I made a sort of handshake deal with my nurses to leave me alone between 11 and 7. This mostly worked (and was reasonable in my case since I was only there waiting for the first round of chemo to start). I also refused to allow the night nurse to draw blood at 4 am, and that was that. She never came back, and that was fine: after all, there are lots of cases where they really don’t need your counts on a daily basis. And they &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; don’t need them at 4 am. That’s merely for the convenience of doctors, who want the results back by 8 am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;There’s much more that could be done about this, but I’ll spare you. This is my rant for the day—now backed up by an official column in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. I can’t wait for the letters to pour in offering BS excuses for why none of these solutions is really possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Convert a Bird Scooter to a personal one with $32 kit</title>
<link>https://scootertalk.org/viewtopic.php?p=1643&amp;fbclid=IwAR0-b9xJKny5r5adXwc6gocfXbqZ9scA1fpgX5t8L7f7afbT9RZU33Exqnk#p1643</link>

<description>I also bought a “kit” very similar to yours, I paid the extra dough (about $50 total) to get it from a domestic seller so it would get here quick. I converted a scooter a few weeks ago and it ran fine, though apparently there’s a bug in the board that is a common-ish problem where the headlight shorts out the board. So you can either have a working scooter, or a giant flashlight, but not both at once. Not the worst thing in the world.&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s not like I really care, but I can’t figure out how to connect to the scooter in the app. I chalked it up to the fact that it’s not a consumer M365 and that it was made specifically for bird, so maybe it’s missing the proper hardware, but now I’m curious. As long as I have the same motherboard as you do, I should be able to connect through the app. If you have any tips or can explain what you did, I’d really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Hashicorp Vault v1.0</title>
<link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to announce the public availability of HashiCorp Vault 1.0. Vault is a tool to manage secrets and protect sensitive data for any infrastructure and application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 is focused on renovating Vault's infrastructure to support high performance, scalable workloads. The 1.0 release of Vault includes significant new functionality including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batch Tokens:&lt;/strong&gt; A new type of token optimized for high performance, ephemeral workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Cloud Auto Unseal:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud-based auto unseal is now open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAPI Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Vault now supports the OpenAPI standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Alibaba Cloud Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Expanded support for running Vault on Alibaba Cloud environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated UI:&lt;/strong&gt; Significant updates to the Vault UI for better ease of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCP Cloud KMS Secrets Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Manage GCP CKMS keys from within Vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release also includes additional new features, secure workflow enhancements, general improvements, and bug fixes. The Vault 1.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; provides a full list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 is a major milestone for the Vault team and HashiCorp as a whole. Vault is the fourth HashiCorp project to reach 1.0, and where we are today is the result of nearly four years of hard work between HashiCorp and the broader open source community. We are immensely grateful to the community for their contributions. As always, thank you for all of your pull requests, ideas, bug reports, and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;batch-tokens&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;batch-tokens&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#batch-tokens&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Batch Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch tokens are a new type of token that support ephemeral, high performance workloads. These tokens do not write to disk, significantly reducing the performance cost of any operation within Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trade off, batch tokens are not persistent and should not be used for any kind of long-lived or ongoing operation or any operation that requires resiliency of that token in the face of the failure or downtime of the Vault cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ephemeral nature of batch tokens makes them well suited for large batches of single-purpose operations such as use of the transit secret engine, but ill suited for operations such as persistent access for secrets within a K/V engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Open Source Cloud Auto Unseal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vault 1.0, we are open sourcing Cloud Auto Unseal, allowing for all users of Vault to leverage cloud services such as AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and GCP CKMS to manage the unseal process for Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to open source Cloud Auto Unseal to simplify the process of storing and reassembling Shamir's keys for all users. While we originally thought cloud auto-unseal was just an enterprise compliance need, we've realized in working with the community that auto-unseal is more for ease of use than compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that HSM-based Auto Unseal (via the PKCS#11 standard) and Seal-Wrap will continue to remain features within Vault Enterprise. Both of these features are typically deployed to conform with government and regulatory compliance requirements, and thus are aligned with enterprise use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openapi&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;openapi&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#openapi&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; OpenAPI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 now supports the Open API Initiative's OpenAPI standard, joining a host of other major open source projects in providing a vendor-neutral description format for its API calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;/sys/internal/specs/openapi&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, Vault can generate an OpenAPI v3 document that describes mounted backends and endpoint capabilities for a given token's permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-ui&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;updated-ui&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#updated-ui&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Updated UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The releases leading up to 1.0 have seen significant updates to the Vault UI. These include wizards to help introduce new users to common Vault workflows for configuring Vault and storing secrets, updated screens for how users mount auth methods and secret engines, support for managing key versioning within the K/V v2 secrets engine, and a host of other updates to help ensure that Vault can almost completely be deployed, initialized, and managed from within the Vault UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0 is the culmination of a very significant amount of work from the Vault UI team over the last few major releases. We will publish a deep dive highlighting the UI team's work, and Vault's ability to be configured and manage workflows graphically, in an upcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Expanded Alibaba Cloud Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 expands on features for operating Vault with and within Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba Cloud KMS is now supported as a Seal-Wrap and Auto Unseal target, and the Alibaba Cloud Auth Method is now a supported interface for Auto Auth within Vault Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; GCP CKMS Secret Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 sees the release of a new secrets engine for managing cryptographic operations within Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Key Management System. This interface allows for transit-like decrypt/encrypt operations, key creation, and key management within external GCP CKMS systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;other-features&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#other-features&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Other Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new features in Vault 1.0 that have been developed over the course of the 0.11.x releases. We have summarized a few of the larger features below, and as always consult the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for full details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Secret Engine Root Credential Rotation:&lt;/strong&gt; The credential used by the AWS secret engine can now be rotated, to ensure that only Vault knows the credentials it is using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Backend Migrator:&lt;/strong&gt; A new operator migrate command allows offline migration of data between two storage backends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit Key Trimming:&lt;/strong&gt; Keys in transit secret engine can now be trimmed to remove older unused key versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication Speed Improvements (Vault Enterprise):&lt;/strong&gt; Vault's replication system has been overhauled to dramatically improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrade-details&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;upgrade-details&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#upgrade-details&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 introduces significant new functionality. As such, we provide both general upgrade instructions and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/upgrading/upgrade-to-1.0.html&quot;&gt;Vault 1.0-specific upgrade page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues&quot;&gt;Vault GitHub issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; or post to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vault-tool&quot;&gt;Vault mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault&quot;&gt;https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault&lt;/a&gt;. Users can download the open source version of Vault at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaultproject.io/&quot;&gt;https://www.vaultproject.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy Vault 1.0!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112402&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-300x169.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-768x432.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Samsung was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-busted-tweeting-stock-photos-to-promote-galaxy-a8-camera/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;busted for using stock photos&lt;/a&gt; to show off capabilities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0794JC2K5/diy0c-20&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Galaxy A8&lt;/a&gt;’s camera. And now they did it again – they used a stock image taken with a DSLR to fake the camera’s portrait mode. How do I know this, you may wonder? Well, it’s because Samsung used MY photo to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I found out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, while I was trying to find a suitable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/still-using-flickr-struggling-leave/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;alternative for Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, I ended up creating a profile on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eyeem.com/u/dunja0712&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;EyeEm&lt;/a&gt;. Since they’re partnered with Getty, some of my images were selected to be sold through Getty’s collection. I totally forgot about it, until a few weeks ago when I got an email from EyeEm: &lt;em&gt;Congratulations, you sold a photo!&lt;/em&gt;  Awwww, I made my first sale on EyeEm! For some reason, someone bought this portrait of me goofing around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112399&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-745x493.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-745x493.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-300x199.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-768x509.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious as I am, I performed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/four-ways-find-stolen-photos-online/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;reverse image search&lt;/a&gt; a few days later, just for fun. I thought that, even if I get to see the image online, it could be included in a blog post about outdoor activities, nature, autumn… Maybe even makeup. But to my surprise, there was only a bunch of search results related with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07F3RNKZL/diy0c-20&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Galaxy A8 Star&lt;/a&gt;. I clicked on the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/my/smartphones/galaxy-a8star-g885/SM-G885FZKDXME/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, scrolled down, and saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112401&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-745x445.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-745x445.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-300x179.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-768x459.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1.jpg.optimal.jpg 1150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was to burst out into laughter. Just look at the Photoshop job they did on my face and hair! I’ve always liked my natural hair color (even though it’s turning &lt;span&gt;gray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/dunja0712/43026058702/in/dateposted/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;black and white&lt;/a&gt;), but I guess the creator of this franken-image prefers reddish tones. Except in the eyes though, where they removed &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever created this image, they also cut me out of the original background and pasted me onto a random photo of a park. I mean, the original photo was taken at f/2.0 if I remember well, and they needed the “before” and “after” – a photo with a sharp background, and another one where the almighty “portrait mode” blurred it out. So Samsung’s Photoshop master resolved it by using a different background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twentytwenty-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/my-feature-focus-where-needed-109007145-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/my-feature-focus-where-needed-109007137-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’d made my first sale on EyeEm and saw the image on Samsung Malaysia’s website right after that, I didn’t even assume that they’d stolen the image. I mean, why would they? It’s not expensive for a huge company like that to buy one stock photo. Although, to be honest, I think that they should have paid more for a better retoucher. But just to make sure, I got in touch with EyeEm, asking whether Samsung bought the image from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful lady from customer support told me that the sale wasn’t registered on EyeEm yet. However, she explained that sometimes buyers have subscriptions with Getty Images, meaning that they will be billed later for their photos. “Photos can be used months before we get sales data for the photo,” she added, and promised to keep me updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I contacted Getty to check whether the sale was made through their website. I never got a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried getting in touch with Samsung too, but it’s impossible to do it via its website unless you have a problem with some of the company’s devices. I sent a message to Samsung Global via Facebook, explaining my problem. All I got was a bunch of generic messages teaching me how to use Samsung smartphones. Thanks, Samsung, but I use Huawei. At least they do a better job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/huawei-passes-off-dslr-photos-as-smartphone-camera-photos-again/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;faking smartphone images&lt;/a&gt; with photos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/huawei-p9-leica-camera-sample-image-actually-shot-4500-canon-kit/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;shot on a DSLR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it’s nothing new that smartphone companies use DSLR photos to fake phone camera’s capabilities. Samsung did it before, so did Huawei. And I believe many more brands do it, we just haven’t found out about it yet. I’m pretty sure that Samsung at least bought my photo legally, even though I haven’t received the confirmation of it. But regardless, this is false advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that smartphone cameras are getting better (and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/lg-patents-a-phone-with-16-lenses/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;more and more lenses&lt;/a&gt; with every new phone). But, we definitely shouldn’t trust the ads showing off their capabilities, or at least take them with a grain of salt. Although, to be honest – I doubt anyone would believe an ad with a Photoshop job this terrible anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Samsung used my DSLR photo to fake their phone’s “portrait mode” - DIY Photography</og:title>
<og:description>Earlier this year, Samsung was busted for using stock photos to show off capabilities of Galaxy A8’s camera. And now they did it again – they used a stock image taken with a DSLR to fake the camera’s portrait mode. How do I know this, you may wonder? Well, it’s because Samsung used MY photo …</og:description>

<title>Google&amp;#039;s cross-platform Flutter UI toolkit goes 1.0</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/googles-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit-hits-version-1-0/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/googles-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit-hits-version-1-0/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s UI toolkit for building mobile Android and iOS applications, hit its version 1.0 release today. In addition, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also today announced a set of new third-party integrations with the likes of Square and others, as well as a couple of new features that make it easier to integrate Flutter with existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-source &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/flutter-io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;flutter-io&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt; project made its debut at Google’s 2017 I/O developer conference. Since then, it’s quickly grown in popularity, and companies like Groupon, Philips Hue, Tencent, Alibaba, Capital One and others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/showcase&quot;&gt;already built applications&lt;/a&gt; with it, despite the fact that it had not hit version 1.0 yet and that developers have to write their apps in the Dart language, which is an additional barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, Google says, developers have already published “thousands” of Flutter apps to the Apple and Google app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754464&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;266&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flutter is our portable UI toolkit for creating a beautiful native experience for iOS and Android out of just a single code base,” Tim Sneath, Google’s group product manager for Dart, explained. “The problem we’re solving is the problem that most mobile developers face today. As a developer, you’re kind of forced to choose. Either you build apps natively using the platform SDK, whether you’re building an iOS app or an Android app. And then you’ve got to build them twice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneath was also part of the Silverlight team at Microsoft before he joined Google in 2017, so he’s got a bit of experience in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://adtmag.com/articles/2017/11/27/sneath-joins-flutter.aspx&quot;&gt;what doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; in this space of cross-platform development. It’s no secret, though, that Facebook is trying to solve a very similar problem with React Native, which is also quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754461&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pasted-image-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, React Native is obviously a technology that’s proven quite popular,” Sneath said. “One of the challenges that React Native developers face, or have reported in the past — one challenge is that native React Native code is written in JavaScript, which means that it’s run using the browser’s JavaScript engine, which immediately kind of move this a little bit away from the native model of the platform. The bit that they are very native in is that they use the operating system’s own controls. And while on the surface, that seems like a good thing in practice, that had quite a few challenges for developers around compatibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, obviously believes that its ability to compile to native code — and the speed gains that come with that — set its platform apart from the competition. In part, it does this by using a hardware-accelerated 2D engine and, of course, by compiling the Dart code to native ARM code for iOS and Android. The company also stresses that developers get full control over every pixel on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/REJDzio_h7o?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With today’s launch, Google is also announcing new third-party integrations to Flutter. The first is with Square, which announced two new Flutter SDKs for building payments flows, both for in-app experience and in-person terminals using a Square reader. Others are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.2dimensions.com/&quot;&gt;2Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, for building vector animations and embedding them right into Flutter, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nevercode.io/&quot;&gt;Nevercode&lt;/a&gt;, which announced a tool for automating the build and packaging process for Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for new Flutter features, Google today announced “Add to App,” a new feature that makes it easier for developers to slowly add Flutter code to existing apps. In its early days, Flutter’s focus was squarely on building new apps from scratch, but as it has grown in popularity, developers now want to use it for parts of their existing applications as they modernize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other new feature is “Platform Views,” which is essentially the opposite of “Add to App” in that it allows developers to embed Android and iOS controls in their Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754462&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Flare.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;580&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft and Docker team up to make packaging cloud-native applications easier</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/microsoft-and-docker-team-up-to-make-packaging-and-running-cloud-native-applications-easier/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and Docker today announced a new joint open-source project, the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB), that aims to make the lifecycle management of cloud-native applications easier. At its core, the CNAB is nothing but a specification that allows developers to declare how an application should be packaged and run. With this, developers can define their resources and then deploy the application to anything from their local workstation to public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification was born inside Microsoft, but as the team talked to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/docker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;Docker,&lt;/a&gt; it turns out that the engineers there were working on a similar project. The two decided to combine forces and launch the result as a single open-source project. “About a year ago, we realized we’re both working on the same thing,” Microsoft’s Gabe Monroy told me. “We decided to combine forces and bring it together as an industry standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, Microsoft is launching its own reference implementation of a CNAB client today. Duffle, as it’s called, allows users to perform all the usual lifecycle steps (install, upgrade, uninstall), create new CNAB bundles and sign them cryptographically. Docker is working on integrating CNAB into its own tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also today launched Visual Studio extension for building and hosting these bundles, as well as an example implementation of a bundle repository server and an Electron installer that lets you install a bundle with the help of a GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s worth noting that we’re talking about a specification and reference implementations here. There is obviously a huge ecosystem of lifecycle management tools on the market today that all have their own strengths and weaknesses. “We’re not going to be able to unify that tooling,” said Monroy. “I don’t think that’s a feasible goal. But what we can do is we can unify the model around it, specifically the lifecycle management experience as well as the packaging and distribution experience. That’s effectively what Docker has been able to do with the single-workload case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Microsoft and Docker would like for the specification to end up in a vendor-neutral foundation. Which one remains to be seen, though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencontainers.org/&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; seems like the natural home for a project like this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing Open Source of WPF, Windows Forms, and WinUI</title>
<link>https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/12/04/announcing-open-source-of-wpf-windows-forms-and-winui-at-microsoft-connect-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/12/04/announcing-open-source-of-wpf-windows-forms-and-winui-at-microsoft-connect-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Build 2018, I outlined our approach to helping you be more productive when developing apps, including the introduction of .NET Core 3.0. We also started decoupling many parts of the Windows development platform, so you can adopt technologies incrementally. Today at Microsoft Connect(); 2018 Conference we shared the next steps – specifically to support innovations in UI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 adds support for building client apps using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, and XAML Islands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPF, Windows Forms, and Windows UI XAML Library (WinUI) are now open source, so you can create experiences with the freedom you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Scott Guthrie announced today, the first preview of .NET Core 3.0 is available. This version of .NET adds support for building Windows desktop apps using WPF and Windows Forms. You will now be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run multiple instances of .NET Core 3.0 side-by-side on the same computer so you can update WPF and Windows Forms apps to a new version of .NET without updating the entire OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use modern controls and Fluent styling from the WinUI XAML Library via XAML Islands from .NET Core 3.0 apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://aka.ms/netcore3preview1&quot;&gt;.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1&lt;/a&gt;, try out the preview, and give us feedback. The next version of the .NET Framework, .NET Framework 4.8, will include new controls that use the latest browser and media players in Windows 10, support the latest standards, and WPF and Windows Forms apps will have access to WinUI via XAML Islands for modern look and touch support. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/10/04/update-on-net-core-3-0-and-net-framework-4-8/&quot;&gt;The .NET Team blog&lt;/a&gt; details the differences and compatibility between .NET Core and .NET Framework moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey is our continued commitment to creating the development platform with you, through open source. Our three, popular Windows UX frameworks are ready for your contributions on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/wpf&quot;&gt;WPF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/winforms&quot;&gt;Windows Forms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml&quot;&gt;WinUI&lt;/a&gt;. Open sourcing these technologies provides transparency between the product team and the community, helps democratize Windows development, and enables the community to engage and contribute to these repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to your contributions. You can get started with Windows Forms and WinUI now. WPF is starting with System.Xaml, with more to come over the following months.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google personalizes search results even when you’re logged out, new study finds</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;NAeTEU&quot;&gt;The amount of personalization inherent in any one of Google’s many massive software products runs deep, based on everything from your search history to your location to every single search link you might have clicked. And avoiding that personalization seems to have become more difficult over the years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/p/a68069bc-b85f-4d13-8e11-2b1d454c11e9/&quot;&gt;According to a new study conducted by Google competitor DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, it does not seem possible to avoid personalization when using Google search, even by logging out of your Google account and using the private browsing “incognito” mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TkV0VK&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo conducted the study in June of this year, at the height of the US midterm election season. It did so with the ostensible goal of confirming whether Google’s search results exacerbate ideological bubbles by feeding you only information you’ve signaled you want to consume via past behavior and the data collected about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Y9d2ET&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The study found that Google search results varied significantly, even in private mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q2KmAb&quot;&gt;It’s not clear whether that question can be reliably answered with these findings, and it’s also obvious DuckDuckGo is a biased source with something to gain by pointing out how flawed Google’s approach may be. But the study’s findings are nonetheless interesting because they highlight just how much variance there are in Google search results, even when controlling for factors like location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Sv7Oh2&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo found that a majority of participants in its study saw different results when searching three divisive terms: “gun control,” “immigration,” and “vaccinations.” According to the company, “these discrepancies could not be explained by changes in location, time, by being logged in to Google, or by Google testing algorithm changes to a small subset of users.” DuckDuckGo says it controlled for location by treating local results that varied across regions as though they were identical. “Interestingly, this adjustment didn’t affect overall variation significantly,” the study reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;r6Np0f&quot;&gt;For the study, DuckDuckGo compiled 87 result sets (76 on desktop and 11 on mobile), and it conducted the searches consecutively and simultaneously starting at 9PM ET on June 24th, 2018. It did one private, logged-out test and then a logged-in test immediately after, so as not to influence the private test with prior results. What DuckDuckGo found was that using private browsing and logging out of Google had almost no effect on the variation in search results: users saw a roughly equitable amount of variation across all three searches and when searching privately and while logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JsOz7Z&quot;&gt;Some key elements to the variation included changes in news sources and the placement of sometimes identical links in different positions, which has a drastic impact on the likelihood that they get clicked. The study also found variations in how news articles and videos were laid out among standard text links, and as many as 22 different domains showing up in the first page of results for “vaccinations,” with a standard search result page typically containing 10 organic links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;IhMdBy&quot;&gt;Perhaps most importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any way to get a single, objective search result from Google that can be easily replicable across users or locations. To further drive home the point that private and logged-out searches are still equally variable, DuckDuckGo calculated the difference between text results for private, logged-out users and compared them to both the results of other anonymous users and the standard, logged-in search results for those initial users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nkDhab&quot;&gt;“We saw that when randomly comparing people’s private modes to each other, there was more than double the variation than when comparing someone’s private mode to their normal mode,” the study reads. The data indicates that between standard, logged-in search results and private, logged-out ones, there was typically a difference of only one or two domains, while the variation between anonymous users was from three (for gun control) to five (for vaccinations) domain changes. That indicates that there is some heavy personalization going on for people using private browsing when logged out, and it’s not clear why that is or what effect it’s having on user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;M5ct6F&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the study seems to prove that there’s no easy way to use Google search without the software seemingly trying to determine who you are and whether it can better serve your needs. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; technology companies all over the world built businesses around being smarter, faster, better automated, and more personal. (And by giving away really useful, ad-supported products for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M60rM0&quot;&gt;A majority of internet users wouldn’t use Google search if it wasn’t constantly a best-in-class search engine, with a number of tangential benefits, like the Chrome browser tie-ins, that make it a lot easier and more convenient than, say, DuckDuckGo. But it’s still unsettling to know that there’s so much unseen, algorithmic tinkering going on when you perform a basic action, like searching one or two-word terms on Google. And that there’s really nothing we can do to get a neutral result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;kUiHQ8&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says incognito mode doesn’t base results on signed-in search histories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N6Z6CO&quot;&gt;Google could not comment on a study it did not have access to, but the company says that search results can change by the minute and sometimes even by the second, especially for news topics. Google also says that personalization is done on only a small fraction of the total number of queries entered into search, and relying on recent queries is often to determine the context for a search, like when a word may apply to a sports team and a city simultaneously. The company did confirm that it does not personalize results for incognito searches using signed-in search history, and it also confirmed that it does not personalize results for the Top Stories row or the News tab in search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a1vulN&quot;&gt;Following the study’s publication this morning, Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it found the methodology flawed and the findings misleading. “This study’s methodology and conclusions are flawed since they are based on the assumption that any difference in search results are based on personalization. That is simply not true,” a Google spokesperson said. “In fact, there are a number of factors that can lead to slight differences, including time and location, which this study doesn’t appear to have controlled for effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jXF95i&quot;&gt;In a separate series of statements, Danny Sullivan, who ran the influential Search Engine Land blog and now works as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@searchliaison&quot;&gt;Google’s public liaison for search&lt;/a&gt;, echoed similar sentiments on Twitter about the nature of personalization in Google Search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cZHKEu&quot; readability=&quot;8.1&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.5294117647059&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Over the years, a myth has developed that Google Search personalizes so much that for the same query, different people might get significantly different results from each other. This isn’t the case. Results can differ, but usually for non-personalized reasons. Let’s explore…&lt;/p&gt;
— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1070027261376491520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nwO8FE&quot;&gt;It’s important to note that any kind of personalization, even based on just location, isn’t a new feature or something Google has been doing behind the scenes without anyone’s knowledge. The company began personalizing search results for every user, even those without a Google account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-now-personalizes-everyones-search-results-31195&quot;&gt;way back in 2009&lt;/a&gt; using an anonymous cookie that would take into account information like your location, language, search history, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DeC4E2&quot;&gt;More recently, the company says it’s moved away from personalizing search results, even as it increasingly uses personalization for products like Google Assistant and Gmail because it didn’t seem to really improve the search experience. “A query a user comes with usually has so much context that the opportunity for personalization is just very limited,” Pandu Nayak, the head of ranking at Google search, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/google-tests-changes-to-its-search-algorithm-how-search-works.html&quot;&gt;told CNBC in September&lt;/a&gt;. Google says it still personalizes for location and “immediate context from a prior search.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4u2s3f&quot;&gt;Regardless, Google has come under fire in the last couple of years for engaging in practices that, while not exactly clandestine, were certainly not widely known and likely kept out of the limelight to avoid too much public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JXEuck&quot;&gt;One notable example, surfaced by an investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, was how app developers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550830/congress-google-apple-third-party-app-republicans&quot;&gt;often able to read your personal Gmail messages&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted concern from some users and a congressional inquiry. Google also felt the need to stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15862492/google-gmail-advertising-targeting-privacy-cloud-business&quot;&gt;scanning Gmail messages to target advertisements last year&lt;/a&gt; because it was worried that the practice, when it came to light in contract negotiations, might scare away enterprise companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;rhKcdN&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has come under fire for not being transparent about how its products work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;llHg1j&quot;&gt;Google also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951914/google-plus-data-breach-exposed-user-profile-information-privacy-not-disclosed&quot;&gt;failed to disclose a flaw in a Google+ API&lt;/a&gt; that could have exposed hundreds of thousands of users’ personal information for roughly six months, an action that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17964134/google-plus-congress-privacy-data-vulnerability&quot;&gt;might result in a Federal Trade Commission investigation&lt;/a&gt;. And in September, Google was forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17904762/google-chrome-sign-in-changes-feedback&quot;&gt;reverse a controversial Chrome login feature&lt;/a&gt; that would help it better target ads by automatically logging users into the browser without their express permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1OXU1T&quot;&gt;The common thread here is that Google’s products, while often free to use and usually quite well-designed, only make money by using a vast trove of personal information to sell targeted online advertisements. And to improve how much money it makes from each ad sale, and the total quantity of ads it sells, Google often resorts to tactics its users have little insight into or deep understanding about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1n9cQo&quot;&gt;Personalized search results aren’t necessarily nefarious on their own. But the ways Google’s algorithms function — especially those that are now aided by complex and often unexplainable artificial intelligence software — are and always will be outside the understanding of the common user. By definition, that means most people have no idea how they work, including lawmakers and members of privacy watchdogs and advocacy groups.
