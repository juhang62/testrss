<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand the concern over Timnit Gebru’s resignation from Google.  She’s done a great deal to move the field forward with her research.  I wanted to share the email I sent to Google Research and some thoughts on our research process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s the email I sent to the Google Research team on Dec. 3, 2020:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers).  We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission).  Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why.  It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues.  We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback.  Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date.  We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing.  I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please don’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I know we all genuinely share Timnit’s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive.  No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she’ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Jeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve also received questions about our research and review process, so I wanted to share more here.  I'm going to be talking with our research teams, especially those on the Ethical AI team and our many other teams focused on responsible AI, so they know that we strongly support these important streams of research.  And to be clear, we are deeply committed to continuing our research on topics that are of particular importance to individual and intellectual diversity  -- from unfair social and technical bias in ML models, to the paucity of representative training data, to involving social context in AI systems.  That work is critical and I want our research programs to deliver more work on these topics -- not less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my email above, I detailed some of what happened with this particular paper.  But let me give a better sense of the overall research review process.  It’s more than just a single approver or immediate research peers; it’s a process where we engage a wide range of researchers, social scientists, ethicists, policy &amp;amp; privacy advisors, and human rights specialists from across Research and Google overall.  These reviewers ensure that, for example, the research we publish paints a full enough picture and takes into account the latest relevant research we’re aware of, and of course that it adheres to our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ai.google/principles&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1607133682463000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3gCPWXkKKuO3nx1sIqC6XS&quot;&gt;AI Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those research review processes have helped improve many of our publications and research applications. While more than 1,000 projects each year turn into published papers, there are also many that don’t end up in a publication.  That’s okay, and we can still carry forward constructive parts of a project to inform future work.  There are many ways we share our research; e.g. publishing a paper, open-sourcing code or models or data or colabs, creating demos, working directly on products, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This paper surveyed valid concerns with large language models, and in fact many teams at Google are actively working on these issues. We’re engaging the authors to ensure their input informs the work we’re doing, and I’m confident it will have a positive impact on many of our research and product efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the paper itself had some important gaps that prevented us from being comfortable putting Google affiliation on it.  For example, it didn’t include important findings on how models can be made more efficient and actually reduce overall environmental impact, and it didn’t take into account some recent work at Google and elsewhere on mitigating bias in language models.   Highlighting risks without pointing out methods for researchers and developers to understand and mitigate those risks misses the mark on helping with these problems.  As always, feedback on paper drafts generally makes them stronger when they ultimately appear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a strong track record of publishing work that challenges the status quo -- for example, we’ve had more than 200 publications focused on responsible AI development in the last year alone.  Just a few examples of research we’re engaged in that tackles challenging issues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m proud of the way Google Research provides the flexibility and resources to explore many avenues of research.  Sometimes those avenues run perpendicular to one another.  This is by design.  The exchange of diverse perspectives, even contradictory ones, is good for science and good for society.  It’s also good for Google.  That exchange has enabled us not only to tackle ambitious problems, but to do so responsibly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our aim is to rival peer-reviewed journals in terms of the rigor and thoughtfulness in how we review research before publication.  To give a sense of that rigor, this blog post captures some of the detail in one facet of review, which is when a research topic has broad societal implications and requires particular AI Principles review -- though it isn’t the full story of how we evaluate all of our research, it gives a sense of the detail involved:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/technology/ai/update-work-ai-responsible-innovation/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1607133682466000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08X2ji2wMZxQVDEJl1slDJ&quot;&gt;https://blog.google/technology/ai/update-work-ai-responsible-innovation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re actively working on improving our paper review processes, because we know that too many checks and balances can become cumbersome.  We will always prioritize ensuring our research is responsible and high-quality, but we’re working to make the process as streamlined as we can so it’s more of a pleasure doing research here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A final, important note -- we evaluate the substance of research separately from who’s doing it.  But to ensure our research reflects a fuller breadth of global experiences and perspectives in the first place, we’re also committed to making sure Google Research is a place where every Googler can do their best work.  We’re pushing hard on our efforts to improve representation and inclusiveness across Google Research, because we know this will lead to better research and a better experience for everyone here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No, DeepMind has not solved protein folding</title>
<link>http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This week DeepMind has &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that, using artificial intelligence (AI), it has solved the 50-year old problem of ‘protein folding’. The announcement was made as the results were &lt;a href=&quot;https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/CASP14_press_release.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; from the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and latest competition on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14). The competition pits teams of computational scientists against one another to see whose method is the best at predicting the structures of protein molecules – and DeepMind’s solution, ‘AlphaFold 2’,  emerged as the clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;201202-DeepMind-blog&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sc63/50671036703/in/dateposted/&quot; data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50671036703_45086fcbcc_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;201202-DeepMind-blog&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;305&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Don’t believe everything you read in the media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There followed much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55133972&quot;&gt;breathless reporting&lt;/a&gt; in the media that AI can now be used to accurately predict the structures of proteins – the molecular machinery of every living thing. Previously the laborious experimental work of solving protein structures was the domain of protein crystallographers, NMR spectroscopists and cryo-electron microscopists, who worked for months and sometimes years to work out each new structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the experimentalist now all quit the lab and leave the field to Deep Mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they shouldn’t, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is no doubt that DeepMind have made a big step forward. Of all the teams competing against one another they are so far ahead of the pack that the other computational modellers may be thinking about giving up. But we are not yet at the point where we can say that protein folding is ‘solved’. For one thing, only two-thirds of DeepMind’s solutions were comparable to the experimentally determined structure of the protein. This is impressive but you have to bear in mind that they didn’t know which two-thirds of their predictions were correct until the comparison with experimental solutions was made. Would you buy a satnav that was only 67% accurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a dose of realism is required. It is also difficult to see right now, despite DeepMind’s impressive performance, that this will immediately transform biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;201202-DeepMind-molecules&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sc63/50671038798/in/photostream/&quot; data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50671038798_35dc0281ae_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;201202-DeepMind-molecules&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;428&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Impressive predictions – but how do you know they’re correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphafold 2 will certainly help to &lt;em&gt;advance&lt;/em&gt; biology. For example, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4&quot;&gt;already reported&lt;/a&gt;, it can generate folded structure predictions that can then be used to solve experimental structures by crystallography (and probably other techniques). So this will help the science of structure determination go a bit faster in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite some of the claims being made, we are not at the point where this AI tool can be used for drug discovery. For DeepMind’s structure predictions (111 in all), the average or root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) in atomic positions between the prediction and the actual structure is 1.6 Å (0.16 nm). That’s about the size of a bond-length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty good but it’s not clear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;DeepMind’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; how that number is calculated. It &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be calculated only by comparing the positions of the alpha-Carbon atoms in the protein backbone – a reasonable way to estimate the accuracy of the overall fold of the protein. Or, it might be calculated over all the atomic positions, a much more rigorous test. If it is the latter, then an RMSD of 1.6 Å is an even more impressive result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still not nearly good enough for delivering reliable insights into protein chemistry or drug design. To do that, we want to be confident of atomic positions to within a margin of around 0.3Å. AlphaFold 2’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/results.cgi?view=tb_results&quot;&gt;best prediction&lt;/a&gt; has an RMSD for all atoms of 0.9 Å. Many of the predictions contributing to their average of 1.6 Å will have deviations in atomic positions even greater than that. So, despite the claims, we’re not yet ready to use Alphafold 2 to create new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other reasons not to believe that the protein folding problem is ‘solved’. AI methods rely on learning the rules of protein folding from existing protein structures. This means that it may find it more difficult to predict the structures of proteins with folds that are not well represented in the database of solved structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4&quot;&gt;as reported in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the method cannot yet reliably tackle predictions of proteins that are components of multi-protein complexes. These are among the most interesting biological entities in living things (e.g. ribosomes, ion channels, polymerases). So there is quite a large territory remaining were AlphaFold 2 cannot take us. The experimentalists, who have been successful in mapping out the structures of complexes of growing complexity, have still a lot of valuable work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all of the above is supposed to sound a note of caution to counter some of the more hyperbolic claims that have been heard in the media in recent days, I still want to emphasise my admiration for the achievements of the AlphaFold team. They have clearly made a very significant advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That advance will be much clearer once their peer-reviewed paper is published (we should not judge science by press releases), and once the tool is openly available to the academic community – or indeed anyone who wants to study protein structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (02 Dec, 18:43):&lt;/strong&gt; This post was updated to provide a clearer explanation of the RMSD measures used to compare predicted and experimentally determined protein structures. I am very grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ist.ac.at/en/research/sazanov-group/&quot;&gt;Prof Leonid Sazanov&lt;/a&gt; who pointed out some necessary corrections and additions &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sazanovl/status/1334135331956928521?s=21&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Billionaires Build</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/ace.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/ace.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/billionaires-build-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Billionaires Build&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;December 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find that two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There has been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been meaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is about something politicians sometimes say — that the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people — and why this is mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict which people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say that I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to becoming a billionaire — the defining feature of billionaires — was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout, would surely realize this and look for people who would be good at it, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks for at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince Y Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make what they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto: &quot;Make something people want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on unwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and for the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they don't already have. That's the great thing about market economies. If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be, and there would be no room for your startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the need existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a real need, and whether you'll be able satisfy it. That's what they are, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers. They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell you them all, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones, because these can't be faked; the only way to &quot;hack&quot; them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people want. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now. The product and the market will both evolve, and will influence each other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something with a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to figure out: is there a path to a huge market? &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ace.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://boomsupersonic.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Boom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manages to ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy it. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market is by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that it's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small but growable markets a &quot;larval market.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when they were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their own computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every 10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a &quot;phone&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal combination is the group of founders who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;living in the future&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they themselves want. Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people would want these things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers, that's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional, for example. You build something to serve one location, and then expand to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. But these techniques all require some initial seed group of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into during your interview. Who are your first users going to be, and how do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question, it would be &quot;How do you know people want this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most convincing answer is &quot;Because we and our friends want it.&quot; It's even better when this is followed by the news that you've already built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your friends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you can say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from default no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's some other disqualifying flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had made something they themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it must be too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that you have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And the Airbnbs did have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated hosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because they'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about as users. We were able to say to ourselves &quot;They seem to know what they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing yet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.&quot; Which they did, about three weeks into the batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're not ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea to someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time to do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't lying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the founders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential access. They need random access. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ace.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview is that you should take control of the interview and make sure to deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview into a pitch. &amp;amp;langle;elaborate expletive&amp;amp;rangle;. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do in a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all about the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but they explained enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter. And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell you that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you don't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them the answer to some related question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible answer is &quot;nothing.&quot; Instead of convincing them that your idea is bullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar. Far better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when you ask what could go wrong. The partners know that your idea is risky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses. But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying to make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or clueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did spectacularly well in this department. The story of how they'd funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast cereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund them. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them an irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of their qualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined, and could work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole interview showed that they cared. They weren't doing this just for the money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were working so hard on this company was because it was their project. They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all, not just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/genius.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;genuinely interested&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in what you're building. This is what really drives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires from starting companies. The company is their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them could have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or found someone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who become really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makes them keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the same thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who become billionaires from starting companies. So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like they're doing it &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to make money or &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big scale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the first sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are doing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are much less painful ways of seeming cool. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ace.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people. YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad people made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral dilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders. This exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large scale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one, because they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC itself as a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which is disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation of the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also disastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this kind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it. But that kind of acquisition is never very big. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ace.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is not the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this is the defining quality of billionaires?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person could have so much more money than another. It's understandable where that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA of other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad when one person had so much more money than other people, who would disagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good. The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people are much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no legitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're getting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things. But there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don't make that much from it. There is no correlation — in fact, probably an inverse correlation — between how badly you behave and how much money you make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends policy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imagine a better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids that the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the rich kids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how it's really done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your own kids the truth. It's all about users. The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/growth.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;grows fast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even get rolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies take their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, and eventually someone else will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires now. What do users want? What new things could you build for them? Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about that topic. That's how they became billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot; id=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] The YC partners have so much practice doing this that they sometimes see paths that the founders themselves haven't seen yet. The partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions often do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel their job is to convince the partners of the potential of their idea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders leave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot; id=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] In practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your mind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot; id=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] I myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer in my first startup, so I don't blame founders for doing this. There's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You need to make money somehow, and for some people startups are the most efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the startups that get really big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot; id=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] Not these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the Internet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>EU pushes for &amp;#039;right to disconnect&amp;#039; from work at home</title>
<link>https://m.dw.com/en/eu-pushes-for-right-to-disconnect-from-work-at-home/a-55803776</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://m.dw.com/en/eu-pushes-for-right-to-disconnect-from-work-at-home/a-55803776</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has not only upended social life across Europe but dramatically changed the way people work. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germany-to-draft-new-law-amid-rise-in-working-from-home/a-54905730&quot;&gt;ever more people working from home&lt;/a&gt;  — roughly a third of all employees within the bloc according to the Associated Press (AP) — and needing to be constantly reachable, the boundaries between work and private life have become increasingly hazy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, EU lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution arguing that individuals have a fundamental &quot;right to disconnect.&quot; The European Parliament Employment Committee voted 31-to-6, with 18 abstentions, in favor of allowing people to take time off and urged the European Commission to create rules that &quot;catch up with the new reality&quot; of work, according to Alex Agius Saliba, the Maltese Socialist politician who spearheaded the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;After months of teleworking, many workers are now suffering from negative side effects such as isolation, fatigue, depression, burnout, muscular or eye illnesses,&quot; said Saliba, adding: &quot;The pressure to always be reachable, always available, is mounting, resulting in unpaid overtime and burnout.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee measure must now be approved by the full chamber before it can be submitted to the Commission and EU member state governments for a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in favor of the resolution say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/virtual-communication-staying-connected-when-working-from-home/a-53134890&quot;&gt;the need for employees to be available via smartphone or e-mail around the clock&lt;/a&gt; is detrimental to mental health and well-being and that workers should be allowed to be offline without suffering employer retribution as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr size=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) -- Netscape Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUNW), today announced JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object scripting language for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks and the Internet. The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun's industry-leading object-oriented, cross-platform programming language. The initial version of JavaScript is available now as part of the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which is currently available for downloading from Netscape's web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including America Online, Inc., Apple Computer, Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&amp;amp;T;, Borland International, Brio Technology, Inc., Computer Associates, Inc., Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Iconovex Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies, Inc., Informix Software, Inc., Intuit, Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks, Inc., Novell, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Paper Software, Inc., Precept Software, Inc., RAD Technologies, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., Silicon Graphics, Inc., Spider Technologies, Sybase, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Verity, Inc., and Vermeer Technologies, Inc., have endorsed JavaScript as an open standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in future products. The draft specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft specification of Java, is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standards bodies for industry review and comment this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for creating live online applications that link together objects and resources on both clients and servers. While Java is used by programmers to create new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for use by HTML page authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the behavior of objects running on either the client or the server. JavaScript is analogous to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications. JavaScript's design represents the next generation of software designed specifically for the Internet and is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;designed for creating network-centric applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complementary to and integrated with Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complementary to and integrated with HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open and cross-platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java, developed by Sun, is an object-oriented programming language that operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor. Java programs called applets can be transmitted over a network and run on any client, providing the multimedia richness of a CD-ROM over corporate networks and the Internet. Java has been widely hailed by programmers because it eliminates the need to port applications, and by managers of information systems for its potential to lower the costs of distributing and maintaining applications across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With JavaScript, an HTML page might contain an intelligent form that performs loan payment or currency exchange calculations right on the client in response to user input. A multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region. A server-side JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format it in HTML on the fly. A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server. On the server, the scripts might dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited. Netscape will support Java and JavaScript in client and server products as well as programming tools and applications to make this vision a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it was designed from the ground up for the Internet. JavaScript is a natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide use,&quot; said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun. &quot;JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netscape's authoring and application development tools -- Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire and Netscape LiveWire Pro -- are designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications. Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers, both within the enterprise and across the Internet. Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for JavaScript connectivity to high-performance relational databases from Illustra, Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase. Java and JavaScript support are being built into all Netscape products to provide a unified, front-to-back, client/server/tool environment for building and deploying live online applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java is available to developers free of charge. The Java Compiler and Java Developer's Kit as well as the HotJava browser and related documentation are available from Sun's web site at http://java.sun.com. In addition, the Java source code can be licensed for a fee. Details on licensing are also available via the java.sun.com web page. To date, Sun has licensed Java to a number of leading technology companies, including Borland, Macromedia, Mitsubishi, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, and Toshiba. Sun's Workshop for Java toolkit is scheduled for release in Spring 1996. Sun's NEO product family, the first complete development, operating and management environment for object-oriented networked applications, will also use Java-enabled browsers as front-ends to the NEO environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet scripting language standard. JavaScript will be an open, freely licensed proposed standard available to the entire Internet community. Existing Sun Java licensees will receive a license to JavaScript. In addition, Sun and Netscape intend to make a source code reference implementation of JavaScript available for royalty-free licensing, further encouraging its adoption as a standard in a wide variety of products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Self-host your fonts for better performance</title>
<link>https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;November 30, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/goodbye-google-fonts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Fonts&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It’s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That’s also why it’s currently still used on over &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Font-API&quot;&gt;42M websites&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convenience has its price: Performance. Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance#disadvantages-of-web-fonts&quot;&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/self-hosted-fonts-vs-google-fonts-api/&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you’re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already since years. Even Google themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=24m58s&quot;&gt;advised others to self-host fonts&lt;/a&gt; in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts&quot;&gt;Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sia wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d&quot;&gt;a great post&lt;/a&gt; where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/with-google-fonts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network flow with Google Fonts&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimised Google Fonts loading with preconnect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/without-google-fonts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network flow with self-hosting fonts&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimised self-hosting fonts with preload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-old-performance-argument&quot;&gt;The old performance argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.6666666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/about&quot;&gt;https://fonts.google.com/about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;invalidating-the-old-performance-argument&quot;&gt;Invalidating the old performance argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning&quot;&gt;this Google post&lt;/a&gt; they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers&quot;&gt;Cache partitioning in other browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack since years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;: since v86 (October 2020)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt;: since 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚫 &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;: planning to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚫 &lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;: most likely soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚫 &lt;strong&gt;Opera&lt;/strong&gt;: most likely soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚫 &lt;strong&gt;Brave&lt;/strong&gt;: most likely soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚫 &lt;strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/strong&gt;: most likely soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking this post out!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Web Scraping Is Vital to Democracy</title>
<link>https://themarkup.org/news/2020/12/03/why-web-scraping-is-vital-to-democracy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://themarkup.org/news/2020/12/03/why-web-scraping-is-vital-to-democracy</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The fruits of web scraping—using code to harvest data and information from websites—are all around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People build scrapers that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/tree/master/locations/spiders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;find every Applebee’s on the planet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/unitedstates/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collect congressional legislation and votes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.watchpatrol.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;track fancy watches for sale&lt;/a&gt; on fan websites. Businesses use scrapers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://service.octoparse.com/inventory-web-scraping-blind-rivet-supply&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manage their online retail inventory&lt;/a&gt; and monitor &lt;a href=&quot;https://datahut.co/solutions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;competitors’ prices&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of well-known sites use scrapers to do things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyscanner.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;track airline ticket prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.careerbuilder.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;job listings&lt;/a&gt;. Google is essentially a giant, crawling web scraper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrapers are also the tools of watchdogs and journalists, which is why The Markup filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-783/147271/20200708180752488_19-783%20-%20the%20markup%20amicus%20brief%20for%20e-filing%207-8-2020.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court this week that threatens to make scraping illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case itself—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-783.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Van Buren v. United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—is not about scraping but rather a legal question regarding the prosecution of a Georgia police officer, Nathan Van Buren, who was bribed to look up confidential information in a law enforcement database. Van Buren was prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which prohibits unauthorized access to a computer network such as computer hacking, where someone breaks into a system to steal information (or, as dramatized in the 1980s classic movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WarGames&lt;/a&gt;,” potentially start World War III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Van Buren’s case, since he was allowed to access the database for work, the question is whether the court will broadly define his troubling activities as “exceeding authorized access” to extract data, which is what would make it a crime under the CFAA. And it’s that definition that could affect journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as Justice Neil Gorsuch put it during Monday’s oral arguments, lead in the direction of “perhaps making a federal criminal of us all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigative journalists and other watchdogs often use scrapers to illuminate issues big and small, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://manolo.rocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tracking the influence of lobbyists in Peru&lt;/a&gt; by harvesting the digital visitor logs for government buildings to &lt;a href=&quot;https://adobservatory.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monitoring and collecting&lt;/a&gt; political ads on Facebook. In both of those instances, the pages and data scraped are publicly available on the internet—no hacking necessary—but sites involved could easily change the fine print on their terms of service to label the aggregation of that information “unauthorized.” And the U.S. Supreme Court, depending on how it rules, could decide that violating those terms of service is a crime under the CFAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A statute that allows powerful forces like the government or wealthy corporate actors to unilaterally criminalize newsgathering activities by blocking these efforts through the terms of service for their websites would violate the First Amendment,” The Markup wrote in our brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of work is at risk? Here’s a roundup of some recent journalism made possible by web scraping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;list__item&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://covidtracking.com&quot;&gt;COVID tracking project&lt;/a&gt;, from The Atlantic, collects and aggregates data from around the country on a daily basis, serving as a means of monitoring where testing is happening, where the pandemic is growing, and the racial disparities in who’s contracting and dying from the virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;list__item&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://revealnews.org/topic/to-protect-and-slur/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, from Reveal, scraped extremist Facebook groups and compared their membership rolls to those of law enforcement groups on Facebook—and found a lot of overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;list__item&quot;&gt;The Markup’s recent investigation into Google’s search results found that it consistently &lt;a href=&quot;https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors&quot;&gt;favors its own products&lt;/a&gt;, leaving some websites from which the web giant itself scrapes information struggling for visitors and, therefore, ad revenue. The U.S. Department of Justice &lt;a href=&quot;https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/10/20/google-antitrust-lawsuit-markup-investigations&quot;&gt;cited the issue&lt;/a&gt; in an antitrust lawsuit against the company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;list__item&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/asbestos-sharia-law-model-bills-lobbyists-special-interests-influence-state-laws/&quot;&gt;Copy, Paste, Legislate&lt;/a&gt;, USA Today found a pattern of cookie-cutter laws, pushed by special interest groups, circulating in legislatures around the country.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>“I&amp;#039;ve had to relearn coding to get through the new interviews”</title>
<link>https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/3004947/coding-interviews-hackerrank-nightmare</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/3004947/coding-interviews-hackerrank-nightmare</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not a graduate looking for a first job. I've spent 15 years working as a developer and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/316937/strats-jobs-investment-banks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;strategist&lt;/a&gt; at leading investment banks and I'm looking for a new role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, companies hiring developers have espoused all manner of testing processes as way of covering their backs before making recruitment decisions. It's not enough that someone has a proven track record: they also need to complete a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/287595/hackerrank-tests-banking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hackerrank test&lt;/a&gt; or something similar. This has become common in banking, but tech firms are at it too: Facebook has a 45-minute on the spot technical video interview instead of an actual coding test for their potential hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've therefore spent the past few months revising how to code in Python, &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C++, and SQL. I've learned C#/dot net from scratch and I've revisited college mathematics. My technical skills were already very strong. Now they are considerably stronger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this, however, takes time and I'm not convinced that it's time well spent. All I have done is to learn how to solve a certain set of problems (if you stay on Hackerrank for long enough, the same ones keep coming up). With luck this will get me a job, but if I am hired on this basis I feel it will be for the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, when I was interviewing myself, I would come across large numbers of really smart candidates all the time. Once in a while, though, I'd find someone exceptional who could approach problems differently, and those people would always turn out to be the best hires. They would have been filtered out by these systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My technical skills have definitely sharpened up by practicing Hackerrank-style questions, but I believe the companies using these tests are creating a bias in favor of candidates who a) have time to practice and b) who've recently graduated and are familiar with the format. It's very hard to prepare for these tests if you're working full time and have a young family.  It's also an opportunity to excuse ageism. In an assessment the other day I was asked to code something that I hadn't covered for 30 years. If I'd had the opportunity to read-up on it, I would have been fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young people aren't benefiting from these tests either. To succeed in the testing process, you need to code defensively against edge-case problems. First you have to figure out how to solve the problem and then you need to get a working solution, but to get the very best result your solution needs to execute efficiently and to produce the right answer in all edge cases (eg. &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;empty parameters, repeated or negative numbers, massive sets of data); they generally have hidden tests that they will run to check this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The tests are therefore all about excluding candidates rather than identifying brilliant young mavericks with potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if the tests were scrapped. This is unlikely to happen. For the moment, then, experience seems to count for nothing: it's all about how much time you can spend on Leetcode. &lt;/p&gt;
