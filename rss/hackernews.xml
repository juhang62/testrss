&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A box of manuscripts and three notebooks. That's all that's left of the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician who lived his remarkable but short life around the beginning of the twentieth century. Yet, that small stash of mathematical legacy still yields surprises. Two mathematicians of Emory University, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ono/&quot;&gt;Ken Ono&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~strebat/&quot;&gt;Sarah Trebat-Leder&lt;/a&gt;, have recently made a fascinating discovery within its yellowed pages. It shows that Ramanujan was further ahead of his time than anyone had expected, and provides a beautiful link between several milestones in the history of mathematics. And it all goes back to the innocuous-looking number 1729.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramanujan's story is as inspiring as it is tragic. Born in 1887 in a small village around 400 km from Madras (now Chennai), Ramanujan developed a passion for mathematics at a young age, but had to pursue it mostly alone and in poverty. Until, in 1913, he decided to write a letter to the famous Cambridge number theorist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Hardy.html&quot;&gt;G.H. Hardy&lt;/a&gt;. Accustomed to this early form of spam, Hardy might have been forgiven for dispatching the highly unorthodox letter straight to the bin. But he didn't. Recognising the author's genius, Hardy invited Ramanujan to Cambridge, where he arrived in 1914. Over the following years, Ramanujan more than repaid Hardy's faith in his talent, but suffered ill health due, in part, to the grizzly English climate and food. Ramanujan returned to India in 1919, still feeble, and died the following year, aged only 32. Hardy later described his collaboration with Ramanujan as &quot;the one romantic incident in my life&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The taxi-cab number&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The romanticism rubbed off on the number 1729, which plays a central role in the Hardy-Ramanujan story. &quot;I remember once going to see [Ramanujan] when he was ill at Putney,&quot; Hardy wrote later. &quot;I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No', he replied, 'it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'&quot; What Ramanujan meant is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000002&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/d70b4f4ab9ba06d4318d3f6cde04af56/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3. \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anecdote gained the number 1729 fame in mathematical circles, but until recently people believed its curious property was just another random fact Ramanujan carried about in his brain — much like a train spotter remembers train arrival times. What Ono and Trebat-Leder's discovery shows, however, is that it was just the tip of an ice berg. In reality Ramanujan had been busy developing a theory that was several decades ahead of its time and yields results that are interesting to mathematicians even today. He just didn't live long enough to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery came when Ono and fellow mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/&quot;&gt;Andrew Granville&lt;/a&gt; were leafing through Ramanujan's manuscripts, kept at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/library/wren&quot;&gt;Wren Library&lt;/a&gt; at Trinity College, Cambridge. &quot;We were sitting right next to the librarian's desk, flipping page by page through the Ramanujan box,&quot; recalls Ono. &quot;We came across this one page which had on it the two representations of 1729 [as the sum of cubes]. We started laughing immediately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fermat's last theorem and near misses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1637 the French mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermat.html&quot;&gt;Pierre de Fermat&lt;/a&gt; confidently asserted that the answer is no. If &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/857970255153b89161bed5ae13ee8218/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;$n$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; is a whole number greater than &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/857970255153b89161bed5ae13ee8218/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$2,$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; then there are no positive whole number triples &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/857970255153b89161bed5ae13ee8218/images/img-0003.png&quot; alt=&quot;$x,$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/857970255153b89161bed5ae13ee8218/images/img-0004.png&quot; alt=&quot;$y$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/857970255153b89161bed5ae13ee8218/images/img-0005.png&quot; alt=&quot;$z,$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; such that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000002&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/f2fd4e3443a5a93b52753170b4aa6af1/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ x^ n+y^ n=z^ n. \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermat scribbled in the margin of a page in a book that he had &quot;discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain&quot;. Naturally, this assertion was like catnip to mathematicians, who subsequently drove themselves crazy, for over 350 years, trying to find this &quot;truly marvellous proof&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the equation in Ramanujan’s manuscript illustrates is that Ramanujan had found a whole family (in fact an infinite family) of positive whole number triples &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;$x,$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$y$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0003.png&quot; alt=&quot;$z$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; that very nearly, but not quite, satisfy Fermat’s famous equation for &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0004.png&quot; alt=&quot;$n=3.$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; They are off only by plus or minus one, that is, either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000002&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0005.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ x^3+y^3=z^3 + 1 \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000003&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/c1ab304593b59ad425536f971e8ea937/images/img-0006.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ x^3+y^3=z^3 - 1. \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since any positive whole number triple satisfying the equation would render Fermat’s assertion (that there are no such triples) false, Ramanujan had pinned down an infinite family of near-misses of what would be &lt;em&gt;counter-examples&lt;/em&gt; to Fermat’s last theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;None of us had any idea that Ramanujan was thinking about anything [remotely] related to Fermat's last theorem,&quot; says Ono. &quot;But here on a page, staring us in the face, were infinitely many near counter-examples to it, two of which happen to be related to 1729. We were floored.&quot; Even today, nearly 400 years after Fermat's claim and 20 years after its resolution, only a handful of mathematicians even know about the family Ramanujan had come up with. &quot;I'm a Ramanujan scholar and I wasn't aware of it,&quot; says Ono. &quot;Basically, nobody knew.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elliptic curves and climbing K3.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't all. When Ono and his graduate student Sarah Trebat-Leder decided to investigate further, looking at other pages in Ramanujan's work, they found he had developed a sophisticated mathematical theory that went beyond anything people had suspected. &quot;Sarah and I spent time thinking more deeply about what Ramanujan had really done, and it turns out that he anticipated [an area of] mathematic 30 or 40 years before anyone knew this field would exist. That's what we are excited about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that from looking at equations of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000002&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/635e90ec7afe885f2b66131f5d05033c/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ x^3 + y^3 = z^3 \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;it’s not too large a mathematical step to considering equations of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000003&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/635e90ec7afe885f2b66131f5d05033c/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax +b, \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;$a$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$b$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0003.png&quot; alt=&quot;$c$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; are constants. If you plot the points &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0004.png&quot; alt=&quot;$(x,y)$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; that satisfy such an equation (for given values of &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;$a$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/58cb7ae4c22ca71cc935b4df24f74097/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$b$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;) in a coordinate system, you get a shape called an &lt;em&gt;elliptic curve&lt;/em&gt; (the precise definition is slightly more involved, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Elliptic curves played an important role in the eventual proof of Fermat's last theorem, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/very-old-problem-turns-20&quot;&gt;delivered in the 1990s&lt;/a&gt; by the mathematician Andrew Wiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ono and Trebat-Leder found that Ramanujan had also delved into the theory of elliptic curves. He did not anticipate the path taken by Wiles, but instead discovered an object that is more complicated than elliptic curves. When objects of this kind were rediscovered around forty years later they were adorned with the name of &lt;em&gt;K3 surfaces&lt;/em&gt; — in honour of the mathematicians &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kummer.html&quot;&gt;Ernst Kummer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kahler.html&quot;&gt;Erich Kähler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Kodaira.html&quot;&gt;Kunihiko Kodaira&lt;/a&gt;, and the mountain K2, which is as difficult to climb as K3 surfaces are difficult to handle mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Ramanujan should have discovered and understood an exceedingly complicated K3 surface is in itself remarkable. But his work on the surface also provided an unexpected gift to Ono and Trebat-Leder, which links back to elliptic curves. Like all equations, any elliptic curve equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;a0000000002&quot; class=&quot;equation&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/2ea5b5298214161926f63c9c4fa5c2a5/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax +b, \]&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;eqnnum&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;naturally cries out for solutions: pairs of numbers &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/2ea5b5298214161926f63c9c4fa5c2a5/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$(x,y)$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; that satisfy the equation. In the spirit of Fermat, you might look for whole number solutions, but number theorists usually give themselves a little more leeway. They look for solutions that are &lt;em&gt;rational numbers&lt;/em&gt;, that is, numbers that can be written as fractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rightimage&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/news/2015/ramanujan/curves-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Elliptic curves&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;338&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elliptic curves corresponding to whole number values of a between -2 and 1 and whole number values of values of b between -1 and 2. Only the curve for a = b = 0 doesn't qualify as an elliptic curve because it has a sharp corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, in 2014, the mathematician Manjul Bhargava won the Fields Medal, one of the highest honours in mathematics, for major progress in this context. Bhargava showed that most elliptic curves fall into one of two particularly simple classes. Either there are only finitely many rational number solutions; or there are infinitely many, but there is a recipe that produces all of them from just a single rational number solution. (You can read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/conversation-manjul-bhargava&quot;&gt;interview with Bhargava&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/very-old-question-very-latest-maths-fields-medal-lecture-manjul-bhargava&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; exploring some of his work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sift through all elliptic curves in a systematic way, for example by ordering them according to the size of the constants &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/78a49bf8977774f6233d25693a291d82/images/img-0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;$a$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/MI/78a49bf8977774f6233d25693a291d82/images/img-0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;$b$&quot; class=&quot;math gen&quot;/&gt; that appear in their formulas, then you are most likely only ever going to come across these &quot;simple&quot; elliptic curves. The probability of finding a more complicated one, which requires two or three solutions to generate them all, is zero. Searching for such elliptic curves systematically is like searching a haystack for a needle in a way that guarantees the needle will always slip through the net. To get at those more complicated elliptic curves, you need another method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly what Ramanujan came up with. His work on the K3 surface he discovered provided Ono and Trebat-Leder with a method to produce, not just one, but infinitely many elliptic curves requiring two or three solutions to generate all other solutions. It's not the first method that has been found, but it required no effort. &quot;We tied the world record on the problem [of finding such elliptic curves], but we didn't have to do any heavy lifting,&quot; says Ono. &quot;We did next to nothing, expcet recognise what Ramanujan did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physics and extra dimensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another interesting twist to this story. While Ramanujan was working in the abstract realms of number theory, physicists studying real-world phenomena began developing the theory of quantum mechanics. Although a triumph in its own right, it soon became clear that the resulting quantum physics clashed with existing physical theories in an unredeemable way. The rift still hasn't been healed and presents the biggest problem of twenty-first century physics (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/physics-minute-whats-problem-quantum-gravity&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find out more). One attempt at rescuing the situation was the development, started in the 1960s, of &lt;em&gt;string theory&lt;/em&gt;, a prime candidate for a &quot;theory of everything&quot; uniting the disparate strands of modern physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;leftimage&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/news/2015/ramanujan/hardy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hardy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;354&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;G.H. Hardy (1877 - 1947).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A curious prediction of string theory is that the world we live in consists of more than the three spatial dimensions we can see. The extra dimensions, the ones we can't see, are rolled up tightly in tiny little spaces too small for us to perceive. The theory dictates that those tiny little spaces have a particular geometric structure. There's a class of geometric objects, called &lt;em&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds&lt;/em&gt;, which fits the bill (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.maths.org/content/hidden-dimensions&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; to find out more). And one of the simplest classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds comes from, wait for it, K3 surfaces, which Ramanujan was the first to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramanujan could never have dreamt of this development, of course. &quot;He was a whiz with formulas and I think [his aim was] to construct those near counter-examples to Fermat's last theorem.&quot; says Ono. &quot;So he developed a theory to find these near misses, without recognising that the machine he was building, those formulas that he was writing down, would be useful for anyone, ever, in the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ono doesn't rule out that Ramanujan's manuscripts contain further hidden treasures. &quot;I've known about 1729 for thirty years. It's a lovely, romantic number. Ramanujan was a genius and we are still learning about the extent to which his creativity led him to his formulas. His work amounts to one box, kept at Trinity College, and three notebooks, kept at the University of Madras. That's not a lot. It's crazy that we are still figuring out what he had in mind. When is it going to end?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>South Korea switching their 3.3M PCs to Linux</title>
<link>https://www.fosslinux.com/29117/south-korea-switching-their-3-3-million-pcs-to-linux.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fosslinux.com/29117/south-korea-switching-their-3-3-million-pcs-to-linux.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;outh Korean government has announced that it will switch the computers used in its central, local, and public institutions to Linux-based operating systems starting this year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes just one month after the end of “free” support for Microsoft Windows 7, the most prevalent operating system used by the South Korean government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the switch is two-fold.  South Korea was looking to reduce its reliance on Microsoft and Windows and cut down on software licensing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;td_quote_box td_box_center&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will resolve our dependency on a single company while reducing the budget by introducing an open-source operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…said Choi Jang-hyuk, South Korea’s head of Ministry of Strategy and Finance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most Linux distros are free, South Korean officials estimate that migrating their current fleet of approximately 3.3 million PCs from Windows 7 to Linux will cost about 780 billion won (approximately $655 million).  The price tag will cover the implementation, transition, and purchase of new PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministry first plans to test the waters with a pilot test to explore and expose any potential compatibility and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many of South Korea’s government websites, network devices, and software are designed for compatibility with Windows-based operating systems, this is a wise move by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the South Korean’s pilot Linux prove successful, with no major issues encountered, expect a broader roll-out to follow?  If successful, South Korea’s foray into the Linux world could incite and seduce other governments to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean officials have not yet indicated what Linux distro(s) they plan to switch to or if they plan to create their own like their communist cousins to the north, North Korea who use the Red Star OS.  However, the Ministry of National Defense and National Police Agency is using the Ubuntu-based Harmonica OS 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Korean Postal Service is migrating to TMaxOS, a Korean-based OS that uses its Chromium-based web browser, ToGate, and has its unique desktop interface.  Both the South Korean Defense and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security are also entering the Linux fray.  Each of these departments is now using the Debian-based GooRoom Cloud OS.  However, GooRoom Cloud is much like Chrome OS than it is with traditional Linux desktops because it’s cloud-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean government also plans to implement a Desktop as a Service (DaaS) that uses a virtual PC environment that runs on a cloud by the second half of 2020.  The South Korean ministry expects a 72% savings in cost with the DaaS move.  Security standards and DaaS models are currently in development, and pilot tests are scheduled to start in October of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Linux-enthusiast, the news from South Korea is exciting.  I, and many FOSS Linux readers, have long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fosslinux.com/25323/top-reasons-to-switch-from-windows-to-linux-right-now.htm&quot;&gt;advised Linux as a better OS&lt;/a&gt; when compared to Microsoft Windows.  Serious consideration by a government as a viable alternative to Windows validates the trust and faith we have in Linux.  Let’s hope they are successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSS Linux will stay abreast of any new or significant developments and relay to our readers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don’t use the word ‘did’ or dumb anti-piracy company will delete you from Google</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;article__category&quot;&gt;Opinion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__excerpt&quot;&gt;In 2018, the owner of Two-Bit History, a site dedicated to computer history, wrote a successful article about mathematician Ada Lovelace, who some credit as being the first computer programmer. Sadly, if you search Google for that article today you won't find it. Some idiotic anti-piracy company had it deleted because it dared to use the word 'did'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;160.16212871287&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/destroy-delete-remove.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/destroy-delete-remove.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-141816&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every hour of every day of every week of every year, anti-piracy companies send out DMCA notices to remove supposedly infringing content from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these are legitimate takedown requests, targeting everything from movies and TV shows, to music, games, software and anything else that can be digitally reproduced. For copyright holders it’s a herculean task and as a result, mistakes can happen. The scale is such that it’s almost inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, some ‘mistakes’ are so ridiculous as to be unforgivable, especially when they target completely innocent individuals hoping to make a difference with the positive spread of knowledge and information. Case in point: Sinclair Target, the owner of computing history blog, Two-Bit History.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Target wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/18/ada-lovelace-note-g.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron who some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/scholar/ada-lovelace&quot;&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt; as being the world’s first computer programmer, despite being born in 1815. Unfortunately, however, those who search for that article today using Google won’t find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the image below shows, the original Tweet announcing the article is still present in Google’s indexes but the article itself has been removed, thanks to a copyright infringement complaint that also claimed several other victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/twobitdelete-e1581677059867.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/twobitdelete-e1581677059867.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-183030&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there could be dozens of reasons the article infringed someone’s copyrights, the facts are so absurd as to be almost unbelievable. Sinclair’s article was deleted because an anti-piracy company working on behalf of a TV company decided that since its title (What Did Ada Lovelace’s Program Actually Do?) contained the word ‘DID’, it must be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This monumental screw-up was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwoBitHistory/status/1227432312960409602&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter by Sinclair himself, who complained that “Computers are stupid folks. Too bad Google has decided they are in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At risk of running counter to Sinclair’s claim, in this case – as Lovelace herself would’ve hopefully agreed – it is people who are stupid, not computers. The proof for that can be found in the DMCA complaint sent to Google by RightsHero, an anti-piracy company working on behalf of Zee TV, an Indian pay-TV channel that airs Dance India Dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in its seventh season, Dance India Dance is a dance competition reality show that is often referred to as DID. And now, of course, you can see where this is going. Because Target and at least 11 other sites dared to use the word in its original context, RightsHero flagged the pages as infringing and asked Google to deindex them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things only get worse from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up the word ‘did’ in any dictionary and you will never find the definition listed as an acronym for Dance India Dance. Instead, you’ll find the explanation as “past of do” or something broadly along those lines. However, if the complaint sent to Google had achieved its intended effect, finding out that would’ve been more difficult too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/notices/20063681?access_token=LgXDsboHfEShuoNQOg7NXQ&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt; in its full glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/did-notice-dmca-e1581678320198.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/did-notice-dmca-e1581678320198.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-183031&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the notice not only claims Target’s article is infringing the copyrights of Dance India Dance (sorry, DID), but also no less than four online dictionaries explaining what the word ‘did’ actually means. (Spoiler: None say ‘Dance India Dance’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps worse still, some of the other allegedly-infringing articles were published by some pretty serious information resources including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-USGS Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey &lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Did&lt;/strong&gt; You Feel It? (DYFI) collects information from people who felt an earthquake and creates maps that show what people experienced and the extent of damage)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The US Department of Education &lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Did&lt;/strong&gt; (or will) you file a Schedule 1 with your 2018 tax return?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Nature.com &lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Did&lt;/strong&gt; pangolins spread the China coronavirus to people?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the scale of the problem here, we tried to contact RightsHero for comment. However, the only anti-piracy company bearing that name has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightshero.com/en&quot;&gt;next-to-useless website&lt;/a&gt; that provides no information on where the company is, who owns it, who runs it, or how those people can be contacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any action by RightsHero, Sinclair Target was left with a single option – issue a counterclaim to Google in the hope of having his page restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve submitted a counter-claim, which seemed to be the only thing I could do,” Target told TorrentFreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Got a cheery confirmation email from Google saying, ‘Thanks for contacting us!’ and that it might be a while until the issue is resolved. I assume that’s because this is the point where finally a decision has to be made by a human being. It is annoying indeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s interesting to take a line from Target’s analysis of Lovelace’s program. “She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 DELETE “DID”&lt;br/&gt;20 PROFIT?&lt;br/&gt;30 GOTO 10&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Learned French in 12 Months</title>
<link>http://www.runwes.com/2020/02/11/howilearnedfrench.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.runwes.com/2020/02/11/howilearnedfrench.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Also posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@wesleyrunnels/how-i-learned-french-in-12-months-7274bf516b&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-a0-to-b2-in-a-year&quot;&gt;From A0 to B2 in a year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit over a year ago, I was a completely monolingual English speaker with zero experience with the French language. Twelve months later, I very comfortably passed the internationally recognized DELF B2 exam. If you don’t know what “B2” means, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels&quot;&gt;CEFR scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;all of my progress was the result of study and practice at home.&lt;/strong&gt; My learning was entirely self-directed, without any formal programs or immersion. This was only possible through the many amazing resources available online, many of which are free. Furthermore, I succeeded in part because I prioritized receiving quality input and producing output, particularly by spending lots of time talking with fluent French speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say my learning pace was somewhat &lt;em&gt;aggressive&lt;/em&gt;, in that I devoted a lot of time towards learning French over the past year, but it was nowhere near full-time study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t call myself completely “fluent”, but to give you an idea of my level, here are some things I can do without much trouble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fluid conversations completely in French for multiple hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand multiple forms of French media (e.g. news broadcasts, YouTube videos)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read articles intended for native French speakers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dream in French&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; far from native-level proficiency. I definitely have weak points and I can’t express myself in French nearly as well as I can in English. Nevertheless, I’m pretty happy with my level of French and I think many French learners would be too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-im-writing-this-article&quot;&gt;Why I’m writing this article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many people want to learn a foreign language, but the task is definitely quite daunting. There are an enormous number of resources, tools, websites, methods, books, apps, classes, and programs out there, some free and others expensive, and it’s hard to figure out which ones to use and when. I definitely spent a lot of time reading about different programs and figuring out whether they would work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve reached my goal with learning French, I’m writing this article to show other language learners how I achieved it. Much of what I did should be applicable to those learning other languages too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing I say will be revolutionary – I don’t have some “secret trick” or “foolproof method” – but I think that my experiences over the last year will be useful to someone starting to learn a language. I especially hope that this article helps those who are starting in the same place as I did: monolingual, no prior experience with their target language, no immersion, not studying full-time, and not knowing speakers of their target language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, many people advocate for many different methods to learning a language. I don’t think mine was the absolute best way, but it certainly worked well enough and I think seeing it can provide some valuable insight. Later on I’ll mention some things I’d change if I were to repeat the process, as well as other resources I’ve heard good things about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want to get an idea of what I did in this year of study, I’ll first give a timeline of my French learning journey below. Afterwards, I will discuss many topics in more detail, including what resources I used, what order I recommend using them in, and how to accomplish things as cheaply as possible. I’ll also describe in more detail what I can and cannot do, so that you can get as accurate an idea as possible of what it means to be at a solid B2 level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important things, in my opinion, are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;. Approximate milestones are &lt;em&gt;italicized&lt;/em&gt;. Some dates are approximate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11/18: Complete beginner (A0) excluding basics like “hello, do you speak English?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11/18: Started going through the French Duolingo tree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12/18: Started listening to French music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/19: Signed up for the Lingoda half-marathon (now sprint) challenge, starting at A1.2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/19: Started occasionally watching Peppa Pig in French (yes, really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/19: Changed my phone language to French&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/19: Started lessons on Italki, roughly once a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/19: Started (inconsistently) going through the 5000 most common French words deck on Anki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/19: Quit Lingoda after A2.1, but kept all lesson materials from A1-C2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/19: Reached the end of the Duolingo tree (level 1 in all skills, but most were level 3+)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5/19: Reached a solid conversational level, maybe low B1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/19: Started consistently covering 50 new words a day on Anki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/19-9/19: Listened to all episodes of the InnerFrench Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/19-10/19:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Went through all A1-B1 saved material from Lingoda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8/19: Finished maxing out the Duolingo tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/19: Finished the Anki deck, continued to review afterwards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/19-10/19: Went through the “Build a Strong Core” program from the maker of the InnerFrench podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10/19: I probably reached B2 around here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/19: Completed the Italki Challenge for October, taking 20 hours of speaking lessons in October&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10/19-11/19: Started writing texts on Italki Notebooks and getting them corrected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/19-12/19: Took 4 lessons with a professional tutor on Italki who specialized in test prep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12/19: Took the DELF B2 exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12/19: Learned that I passed the DELF B2 with a score of 86/100!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, I learned a tiny bit of French in the fall of 2018 to prep for a trip to Europe, but only a handful of words and touristy phrases. I started seriously studying French in mid-November 2018 and took the DELF a little under 13 months later, but given that I passed it quite comfortably, I think I actually hit the B2 level around 10-11 months in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to expand a bit on what exactly my capabilities and limitations are in French, to give you a more realistic picture of what is achievable in a year of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already mentioned some things I can do pretty easily, like have long and fluid conversations and consume French media. Here are some things I &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; really do that well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand strongly accented speech. For example, one of my online tutors recently sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrPj8mKcf6I&amp;amp;t=2s&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; about speaking Quebecois French. I understand essentially all the “standard” French without subtitles, but very little of the Quebecois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand very slang-heavy speech. I know a good chunk of &lt;em&gt;argot&lt;/em&gt; but there are still plenty of informal vocab words and expressions I don’t know. Especially that damn &lt;em&gt;verlan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write error free text. I can get the message across pretty well without relying on a dictionary, but I often phrase things a bit unnaturally and make minor grammatical errors. For example, here is a screenshot of a correction of part of a text I wrote while prepping for my exam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/learningfrench/image1.png 2w&quot; sizes=&quot;1px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.runwes.com/images/learningfrench/image1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly use less common verb tenses. While I know how to construct the past conditional and future perfect, I still can’t use them very fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize all the weird literary tenses. Imperfect subjunctive? Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand everything native speakers say when talking quickly and casually. I can definitely converse with people, but French people are &lt;em&gt;notorious&lt;/em&gt; for blending and trimming words when they can. Some things can go over my head in rapid, informal speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand complex, technical topics. While I can’t always do this in English either, my lack of specialized French vocabulary prevents me from conversing about topics like economics, philosophy, mathematics, and science at more than a basic-to-intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more limitation: I struggle a bit with French in more “everyday” situations. I’ve spent very little time speaking French &lt;em&gt;in person&lt;/em&gt; with people. If you’re fully immersed, you get to cover all the little things: tying your shoes, pointing out a stain on someone’s shirt, passing the ball to someone in a basketball game. I mean, I know all the basics and can convey my intentions in such situations, but my phrasing might be unnatural and I might not know a word here and there. On the other hand, since I spent so many hours just casually talking with people, I got pretty good at having generic conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, let’s discuss the B2 exam a bit. Here’s my score distribution for the B2 exam (note passing is 50/100 with 5/25 minimum in each section):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/learningfrench/image2.png 2w&quot; sizes=&quot;1px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.runwes.com/images/learningfrench/image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, speaking (oral production) was my strongest score with a near perfect score. This makes sense, as I devoted a large amount of time to speaking practice, spending around 100 hours in the last year talking with native speakers. During the exam, I was nervous but very fluid while speaking, being able to express my arguments very easily and understanding essentially everything they asked of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and reading were also quite good with around 90% scores for each. I didn’t really have any problems with either; I fully understood the texts I was given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening was definitely my worst section, both in score and general impression. I “understood” all the words from the recordings they played, but having to concentrate for minutes at a time while answering questions simultaneously was something I had very little experience doing. In particular, on the shorter recording (2-3 minutes) where we only got 1 listen, I had only answered 1 question out of 7 when the recording ended, not realizing that the answers to all the questions had already been said. I definitely got some lucky points from guessing on some questions and wouldn’t have been too surprised to have received a score of 10 here. However, I will say that much of the difficulty was format-based, instead of comprehension-based. With a bit more practice with the listening format, I likely would have had an easier time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into details about my exact method for learning French and what I recommend, I want to share some general thoughts I have about my experience and language learning in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-perfect-or-easy-method-including-mine&quot;&gt;There is no “perfect” or “easy”, method, including mine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people learn better using different methods. In this article I will explain what I did and why I think it worked out for me. However, at the end of the day I’m just some random guy who learned French, one of the easier languages for an English speaker to learn, to an upper intermediate level. I’m very, very far from being an “expert polyglot savant” and all of my advice may not be ideal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a good chunk of time reading advice online on how to learn French, and while I’ll discuss a lot of useful resources in this article, you should do your own research on what will work for you personally. Of course, don’t spend &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much time planning when you could be spending that time actually learning your target language! Contrary to popular belief, watching polyglot videos on YouTube isn’t going to make you fluent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-languages-in-school-is-very-inefficient&quot;&gt;Learning languages in school is very inefficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incredible number of people have spent many years “learning” languages in school, only to emerge unable to have a basic conversation. How is it possible that I was capable of having full conversations in French within 6 months of learning it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that learning languages in school, especially in the United States, is generally extremely inefficient. If you struggled learning a language in school, don’t let that affect your confidence with learning a new language now. If you practice intelligently, you can learn much more effectively on your own. You get to avoid doing redundant work that isn’t helping you, and you can spend much more time getting 1-on-1 speaking time with teachers who put all their focus lessons on you. Instead of the language learning process being tailored to a standard government curriculum in a classroom of 20+ students, your language learning journey is completely tailored to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-dont-have-to-know-that-much&quot;&gt;You don’t have to know &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as massive of a task as learning a language seems, take solace in the fact that there are really only a certain number of things you have to learn. You only need to know a couple thousand words and a not-too-large number of grammar rules before you have everything you need to become comfortably conversational. Of course, you need to put in the time to practice what you learn, but once you start picking things up it becomes very enjoyable to see yourself progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For languages like French, you already have a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; advantage if you’re already fluent in English. There are an enormous number of cognates between French and English, and this means that you can already recognize &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of French words even if you’ve never spoken a word of French in your life! Furthermore, much of French grammar is similar to English, although of course some things will feel quite weird when you encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-a-matter-of-time-not-ability&quot;&gt;It’s a matter of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, not ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the language learning process can feel overwhelming. To keep myself motivated, I told myself to &lt;em&gt;believe in the process&lt;/em&gt;, and that if I put enough time into things, eventually I’d reach my goal. It turns out I was right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in the previous section, once you know a certain number of words and grammar rules, with some effective practice you will be able to have a solid conversation. If you consistently work on picking up new words and push yourself to address your weaknesses, whatever they may be, &lt;em&gt;you will get there.&lt;/em&gt; It’s not a matter of ability; &lt;em&gt;it’s a matter of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all practice time is equal. Make sure your practice is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; practice, and that you’re not just spending all your time watching French movies and calling it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-languages-is-frustrating&quot;&gt;Learning languages is &lt;em&gt;frustrating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of the difficulty in language learning is getting over the endless feeling of frustration you encounter. If you’re not feeling frustrated sometimes, you probably aren’t learning much. Watching subtitled movies is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;, but you’re probably not challenging yourself and forcing yourself to learn. Struggling to express an idea in your foreign language is &lt;em&gt;frustrating&lt;/em&gt;. Seeing yourself make a grammar mistake you’ve already made 100 times is &lt;em&gt;frustrating.&lt;/em&gt; Frustrate yourself enough and you’ll push your boundaries enough to get to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you shouldn’t frustrate yourself for no good reason, but effective practice often is frustrating! If you truly want to learn, get used to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(P.S.: When I started off, I sometimes watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gno6Uzuo8&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to re-motivate myself after I got frustrated. Once I reached that level (around 6 months in!), it wasn’t so hard anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few months of language learning are really fun because you learn extremely quickly. I remember starting to take some lessons on Duolingo and within a month I could start to understand a good chunk of YouTube comments on French music videos, which really motivated me further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, you learn all the big stuff – past tense, pronouns, base vocab – and you don’t get to see yourself progress as quickly. In this stage, I couldn’t always tell if I was actually making progress. When this happens, remember, &lt;em&gt;trust the process&lt;/em&gt;. The new words you learn will not be as frequent and the grammar rules you learn will be a little more obscure, but as long as you’re learning new things, you’ll gradually notice you make fewer mistakes and things that used to trip you up become second nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-5-most-important-things-to-succeed-in-my-opinion&quot;&gt;The 5 most important things to succeed (in my opinion)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning a language is obviously not easy. I can’t be completely certain why I succeeded, but I think some mixture of the traits below were necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenacity&lt;/strong&gt;: You absolutely need to be tenacious to succeed. As I said, language learning can be very frustrating! If you can overcome your frustration, you’ll be well on your way to achieving your goals. Accept it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: You need to practice consistently. This doesn’t necessarily mean &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt;, but you can’t expect to make much progress if you don’t have some sort of consistency with your learning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honesty&lt;/strong&gt;: You need to be honest with yourself (and your tutors and teachers) about your weaknesses. Do you best to identify what your weaknesses are, and force yourself to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;: So much of what I learned was from trying to figure out something that didn’t make sense to me. Maybe I found an expression that turned out to be an idiom, or a verb was conjugated differently than I expected. In these cases, I either searched online or asked my online tutors until I found a satisfactory answer. If you don’t address your weak points, they will always remain weak points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independence&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re self-studying your target language, you’ll need to take charge of the process. I didn’t have anyone to tell me what to do everyday, and in the end I designed my own language learning process. Do your research, and with enough tips and advice (like with this article, hopefully) you’ll find out roughly what you need to do. Then, execute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll go into more detail about the various resources I used and how I recommend using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;duolingo&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is a popular platform that teaches a lot of basics for various languages. Most people use the Duolingo mobile app, but there is also a desktop version. Duolingo was the primary tool I used to learn the basics of French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-i-recommend-duolingo&quot;&gt;Why I recommend Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can’t speak to the effectiveness of other popular platforms for beginners, I found Duolingo really useful for getting a firm grasp of the basics. If you are using a well-established course, Duolingo can get you a long way towards reaching a lower intermediate level, at least in reading and writing. Duolingo gets a lot of criticism as a language-learning platform, and I actually agree with much of this criticism &lt;em&gt;if you use Duolingo ineffectively.&lt;/em&gt; As much as Duolingo likes to tell you this, 5 minutes a day of fumbling around with the mobile app isn’t going to make you fluent. If you use Duolingo as I explain below, it can serve as a very effective and useful resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-duolingo-effectively&quot;&gt;Using Duolingo effectively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few key points I want to give about using Duolingo effectively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the desktop version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn off the word bank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure the course you’re using has good reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the tips included with each lesson, if available&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read sentence discussions for tricky sentences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-desktop-version-of-duolingo&quot;&gt;Use the Desktop Version of Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with using the Duolingo mobile app, but quickly permanently switched to the desktop version. While Duolingo is mostly known for it’s mobile app, the desktop version of Duolingo is superior to the mobile version, for multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No heart system. You can do as much as you want without getting blocked by your errors. This is essential to getting sufficient practice in to make rapid progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete access to additional resources, like the forum. You can see individual sentence discussions on the app, but not the entire forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better text input. I find it more convenient to enter my text input on my computer than on my phone. Plus, you get to more easily type in accents if you configure your keyboard settings (I use the US International Keyboard with dead keys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better exercise formats. I personally found certain mobile exercises to be less effective than those available on the desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to use the mobile app, make sure you turn off the word bank and view sentence discussions, as I explain below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;turn-off-the-word-bank&quot;&gt;Turn off the Word Bank&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think turning off the word bank is absolutely crucial for learning effectively. By turning off the word bank, you are forced to type out the sentences exactly and really get good practice in. You are no longer practicing &lt;em&gt;recognition&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;recall&lt;/em&gt;. It’s so much easier to forget and confuse words and spellings if you don’t have to type in the words yourself &lt;em&gt;and actually remember them exactly&lt;/em&gt;. Without the word bank, your spelling will be vastly superior, you will internalize grammar better, and your vocab retention will be much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word bank is for people who want to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they’re learning without actually putting up with the frustration that producing your own output gives you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ensure-the-course-youre-using-has-good-reviews&quot;&gt;Ensure the course you’re using has good reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, Duolingo courses are mostly created from the efforts of volunteers, and thus tend to have significant differences in several aspects: audio quality, amount of grammar notes available, forum participation, depth of content, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain Duolingo courses have really good reviews. From my experience with the French and Spanish for English Speakers courses, they are both pretty well executed. I’ve also heard good things about a few others, like German, Esperanto and Norwegian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also heard that some courses are pretty low quality, like Japanese and Mandarin (although things might have changed recently.) Some courses, like Italian, are pretty short and so you can’t reach as high of a level using Duolingo. Other courses don’t have any tips or notes at all, so you’re doomed to fumbling around aimlessly! If you’re picking up a language on Duolingo, make sure you read reviews of those courses online before investing a lot of time in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-the-tips-included-with-each-lesson-if-available&quot;&gt;Read the tips included with each lesson, if available&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many courses, Duolingo provides grammar tips for some or all lessons. I found the tips tremendously helpful for preparing for a lesson and being able to quickly understand why certain sentences are said in certain ways. However, be aware that the tips don’t contain &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that you need to know, and so to address that, you should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-sentence-discussions-for-tricky-sentences&quot;&gt;Read sentence discussions for tricky sentences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Duolingo forum can sometimes be a useful resource. However, the most useful parts of the forum are the individual sentence discussions, where you can find an enormous number of helpful explanations for many sentences. In particular, for the French course, I often found detailed explanations of tricky concepts and idioms found in the sentence discussions, especially by the wonderful course contributor Sitesurf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-suggestions-for-using-duolingo&quot;&gt;Other suggestions for using Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;duolingo-quirks&quot;&gt;Duolingo Quirks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duolingo definitely has its quirks, even within the most well-developed courses, which can sometimes be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, sometimes you’ll submit a correct translation which isn’t accepted. This is occasionally frustrating, but ultimately it’s impossible for Duolingo to recognize all possible correct sentences, so in these cases you’ll have to adjust your answers into the “Duolingo style”. They accept more translations over time; I get occasional e-mails saying they now accept a translation I reported as correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people also complain that some sentences are nonsensical (e.g. “I found a dinosaur eating a carrot in my bathtub.”) Ultimately I don’t mind this sort of thing, because the point is to teach you vocabulary and grammar, while possibly adding a little humor in the mix. You shouldn’t focus on the individual sentences and how “plausible” they are but instead on making sure you understand the underlying foundation behind how the sentences are constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-through-the-duolingo-tree&quot;&gt;Getting through the Duolingo Tree&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through the entire French tree, taking each skill to level 5. I actually did this when the format was a bit different than it is today, so level 5 meant doing the same skill more than 5 times. However, I think that was excessive, and now I think 5 or so times per skill is a reasonable amount. You could maybe trim this down to 3 times per skill, but I’m not convinced that’s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the old level format this took me many months of consistent effort, around 9 months. However, I think I spent too much time on redoing lessons on Duolingo, so I probably should have finished several months earlier than that. Keep in mind that I was &lt;em&gt;grinding&lt;/em&gt; Duolingo so you should not expect to finish in such a time frame unless you are willing to dedicate significant and consistent effort towards completing the tree. Despite Duolingo’s motivational messages, 10 minutes a day is really not very much. I very roughly estimate that getting through the current French or Spanish trees will take somewhere around 150 hours of solid effort to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;laddering-skills&quot;&gt;“Laddering” skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laddering” might be the wrong term here, as it also refers to using one foreign language to learn another, but we’ll stick with it here. The method I use on Duolingo, which I’ve seen recommended by others too, is not to grind out one skill at a time to the max, but to gradually go through lessons roughly one level at a time. This allows you to cover lessons over a longer time span instead of cramming them all at once. If that isn’t clear, refer to this picture for an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/learningfrench/image3.png 2w&quot; sizes=&quot;1px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.runwes.com/images/learningfrench/image3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;italki&quot;&gt;Italki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italki is a platform that connects language learners to professional tutors and conversation partners. It is the primary tool I used to improve my conversation and speaking skills. There are also other useful functions, like Notebooks, where you can post texts for others to correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, Italki is pretty much universally loved by the language learning community, and I completely echo this sentiment. Taking a lot of Italki lessons was largely responsible for the progress I made with my conversation skills. You absolutely &lt;strong&gt;NEED&lt;/strong&gt; to spend a lot of time talking with people, particularly advanced or native speakers of your language, in order to make significant progress understanding native speakers and speaking yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking 1-on-1 lessons on Italki about 3 months in, once I had a solid enough beginner vocabulary and could form some basic sentences. I think this was a pretty good timeline for me, but you can certainly start earlier if you want. I think it’s inefficient to, for example, learn basic vocabulary and grammar through Italki, but you can use it as an early way to practice good pronunciation, get access to useful resources, and get advice on the language learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-teachers-on-italki&quot;&gt;Finding Teachers on Italki&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds on teachers on Italki for all of the major languages, so it can be difficult to figure out how to choose one. My experience is that most teachers are easy to talk to and so ultimately I think it isn’t all that important in the end. Don’t do what I did and stick with one teacher for months (even though she was great) – try different teachers and see which ones you click best with! Using multiple teachers also means you don’t get too accustomed to one person’s way of speaking. Also, teacher ratings are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; inflated, so 5.0 stars means almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially preferred native French speakers, but after taking lessons with non-native speakers, I found that I couldn’t really tell the difference between natives and non-natives. If you’re a beginner, I think this essentially doesn’t matter at all unless you really want to speak with someone who grew up completely immersed in the language and culture, because every teacher on Italki has a very high level in their language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also heavily filtered by price for my lessons. I don’t have any experience with more expensive casual teachers, but I found that the less expensive teachers were perfectly adequate for me. If you’re a beginner, I think finding cheaper teachers is likely perfectly fine. More expensive tutors could likely point you to more resources or are more likely to be professionals, but in my opinion all you need to do is spend a lot of time talking unless you’re an advanced student or have very specific goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re prepping for a proficiency test like the DELF, you can spend some more money on a professional teacher who specializes in test prep. I only did this for four lessons in the weeks before my DELF exam, but I was &lt;em&gt;blown away&lt;/em&gt; by my teacher’s preparedness and the sheer amount of help she gave me in specifically prepping for my exam. If you’re studying on your own, such a teacher can really inform you about how to prepare for the test and remove any surprises you might encounter otherwise. If you’re not studying for an exam, then this probably isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-italki-effectively&quot;&gt;Using Italki effectively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section won’t be very interesting, because I think it’s really easy to use Italki effectively: just talk, a lot! Because of my general lack of desire towards specifically working on grammar or exercises with teachers, I spent the vast majority of my time just talking about random topics with my teachers. Sometimes I felt bad that I didn’t really iron out my “weak points” like using certain verb tenses, but in the end, just talking normally for dozens of hours was entirely sufficient to get my speaking to a very solid level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can always ask your Italki tutors for specific help, as I did occasionally, but if you do what I did and just say you want to just talk casually for an hour, you’ll probably do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;italki-notebooks&quot;&gt;Italki Notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also highly recommend using Italki Notebooks! I should have started earlier, but I only started writing texts on Italki Notebooks pretty close to the end of my learning process. Writing a small text occasionally and getting it corrected will do a lot for correcting small grammatical and structural errors that can plague your writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I started posting notebook entries and for some reason, &lt;em&gt;random people started correcting them without me asking!&lt;/em&gt; It was awesome to receive such detailed feedback, and for some texts that weren’t corrected, I went over them with a teacher during a few Italki lessons. I hadn’t realized that I was making so many mistakes while writing, but after getting my texts corrected I was able to eliminate many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see examples of notebook entries and what notebook corrections look like, you can see my notebook entries on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.italki.com/user/5970842&quot;&gt;my Italki profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;shameless-plugs&quot;&gt;Shameless plugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.italki.com/i/EbAbHa?hl=en-us&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a referral link if you want to get started with Italki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to include profile links to some of my favorite teachers that helped me learn French on Italki. I took multiple lessons with all of them and they were all very friendly and easy to have conversations with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;anki&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki is an application that uses a technique called &lt;em&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/em&gt; to maximize effectiveness when learning a set of words or concepts, such as vocabulary. You can think of it as an improved flash card system. Anki is extremely effective for internalizing large quantities of information, and for this reason it is popular in the language learning community and unsurprisingly among medical students as well. The interface is a little weird but you get used to it pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting a solid start through the beginner stage, I started to use Anki to boost my vocabulary. I wasn’t consistent until around 7 months in, but after a few months, I had solidified thousands of French words into my head and greatly improved both my comprehension and production skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people advocate for making your own Anki deck, but I was too lazy to do this and instead went through the 5000 most common French words deck. Similar decks are available for several other languages. The French deck is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/893324022&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My routine was 50 new words a day, while reviewing all previous words. I almost exclusively used the French to English deck, although the English to French deck is probably also very useful. After a few months of consistent practice I was able to get through the entire deck. This was a pretty aggressive pace, as towards the end I had to go through maybe 200-300 cards a day in total, but I found it worked well enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;innerfrench-podcast&quot;&gt;InnerFrench Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The InnerFrench podcast is a podcast aimed at improving the listening comprehension of intermediate learners. Instead of covering grammar or “boring” topics, Hugo Cotton, the podcast host, talks about a wide range of interesting subjects like “The misfortunes of lottery winners”, “Can we trust our brains?” and “Living on Mars”. The podcast is completely in French. As of early 2020, there are roughly 75 episodes available, with episodes generally ranging from 30 to 40 minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This podcast was very highly recommended online, so I decided to check it out once I reached a lower intermediate level, around 6 or 7 months in. I finished it within a few months, and by the end, I felt that my listening comprehension had improved immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One really nice thing about this podcast is that Hugo speaks somewhat slowly and simply in the earlier episodes as he eases you into listening to French for long periods of time. In later episodes, he speaks more quickly and incorporates more advanced vocabulary and expressions in his speech. This sort of fully French but intermediate level content is exactly the kind of material that helps you bridge the gap from intermediate to advanced listening comprehension, when cartoons are too easy but news broadcasts leave you bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to be aware of is that Hugo talks about a wide variety of topics, some of which are rather political or moral in content (e.g. immigration in France or veganism). I didn’t personally mind this, but Hugo definitely argues for his specific viewpoint, which could rub some people the wrong way. Of course, I hear French people tend to be rather &lt;em&gt;opinionated,&lt;/em&gt; so you could just consider this a way of getting used to French culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lingoda&quot;&gt;Lingoda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lingoda is a platform for taking group or private lessons with professional teachers using the Lingoda language curriculum. Each class lasts 1 hour, has an associated level (e.g. A1.1 or B1.3) and covers a certain topic, like “Mastering the future tense” or “Writing a letter”. A PDF with explanations and exercises is available and used during each class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 months in, I started using &lt;strong&gt;Lingoda&lt;/strong&gt; by signing up for their “Half Marathon” (now “Sprint”) promotion, where you get 50% of the cost refunded if you take 45 lessons in 90 days (with some additional restrictions). I didn’t complete the challenge, but made it about halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Lingoda is a really good platform for learning one of their available languages. I made reasonably rapid progress with it and had no issues with the content or structure of the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I ended up stopping lessons on Lingoda and canceling my subscription. This was for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like having to book lessons 7 days in advance, which seemed to be required starting in the middle of my half-marathon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t particularly like going to classes in general, instead preferring to study on my own or talk casually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to commit to taking a certain number of lessons every month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italki seemed to be an adequate substitute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; going to class or want to improve really fast, doing a bunch of Lingoda lessons, especially if they’re private lessons, is probably one of the most effective and efficient ways out there. If you’re curious, you can sign up for a free trial and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lingoda-class-notes&quot;&gt;Lingoda Class Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the Lingoda class notes pretty useful, so I downloaded all notes from A1.1-C2. I didn’t know how to do this automatically so I manually downloaded all of them, which took around an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, after around 6 or 7 months of learning, I started going through all the class notes from A1 through B1 to fill in any gaps I had. This meant skimming a lot of things and not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doing the exercises like you would in class, and also not having a teacher to guide me through things. Still, I found this to be a pretty effective resource and reference for various grammar concepts. There were also many units on various specific topics, so I got some exposure to a diverse set of vocabulary this way too. Also note that to reach B2, I ended up not reading (or needing) the B2-C2 notes at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can substitute a good grammar textbook for the Lingoda materials if you’re looking for a grammar resource, but I personally found the PDFs effective enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-websites&quot;&gt;Reference Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some websites I visited very regularly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wordreferencecom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordreference.com&quot;&gt;wordreference.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful resource for looking up word definitions and example sentences. If I was ever confused about a word or expression, I searched for it here to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Google Chrome (and maybe other browsers too) you can set up a search engine shortcut to make looking up a word really easy. As an example, if I want to look up the meaning of “attendre”, I can just type “fren attendre” into my address bar to get to the wordreference page for “attendre”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conjugatorreversonet&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-french.html&quot;&gt;conjugator.reverso.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the tool I used to look up verb conjugations. Like with wordreference, you can set up a search engine shortcut to make things fast. For example, I type “rfr attendre” in my address bar to view the conjugation of “attendre”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thoughtcocom-lawlessfrenchcom-and-frenchkwiziqcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtco.com/french-4133079&quot;&gt;thoughtco.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawlessfrench.com&quot;&gt;lawlessfrench.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://french.kwiziq.com&quot;&gt;french.kwiziq.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself on these three sites in particular when I was looking up certain concepts, especially for grammar. They have many excellent articles among them. For example, I often visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/subjunctive/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to review the French subjunctive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;french-music&quot;&gt;French Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to music in your target language is an excellent way to get exposed to native pronunciation, learn vocabulary, and motivate yourself to come to understand the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have fond memories of finding some French songs and gradually, as I learned new words and my listening comprehension improved, slowly understanding more and more of a song. Sometimes, when I couldn’t help myself, I’d look up the lyrics to a song and find out some interesting vocab, especially weird slang words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a vast discography of French music artists out there, so it’s very likely you can find something you enjoy listening to. If you want some recommendations for good artists who make French music, I recommend &lt;strong&gt;Lomepal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Stromae&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Eddy de Pretto&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Angèle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Roméo Elvis&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;L’Impératrice&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be discouraged if you find yourself unable to understand song lyrics very well. At my level, I still struggle with many songs, particularly those that are heavy on slang. However, when I think about it, half of the time I don’t understand what people are singing &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt;, so take comfort in the fact that sometimes, music is just hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want something fun to do once you reach an intermediate level, you can try a listening test where you listen to a song and try to write down as much of the lyrics as you can. I tried this for a couple songs and I thought it was a cool exercise! If you want to check it out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.italki.com/notebook/5970842/entry/1025200&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.italki.com/notebook/5970842/entry/1025201&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are my results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-a-strong-core&quot;&gt;Build a Strong Core&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a Strong Core is a 30-day program offered by Hugo Cotton, the creator of the InnerFrench podcast. It aims to help intermediate-level French speakers fix common grammatical errors and better understand native French speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering how awesome the InnerFrench podcast was, after some deliberation I figured I’d spend the 99 euros and enroll in this course too. A new lesson was released every day, generally including a short video about some France-related topic (e.g. the greater Francophone world) and a short video on some grammar topic (e.g. how French speakers don’t say “ne” orally). There was also an active Facebook group, although I never used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did the program I was already close to a B2 level, so I didn’t get as much out of it than if I were at, say, an A2 level. For example, the speech in the videos was too slow for my taste, so I routinely sped them up to get to a more appropriate speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I got to that level without this program, I personally don’t think this program is necessary, but I still think it is well constructed and possibly worth doing if you’re at the appropriate level. In particular, it excels in getting you used to the speech of native French speakers, with all the syllable-dropping and word-blending they tend to do. While I was able to achieve that using other means, this program would have definitely accelerated that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I watched some &lt;strong&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/strong&gt; in French on YouTube when I was a beginner. This was somewhat helpful, and consuming media at an appropriate level is definitely a good way of improving your listening comprehension, &lt;em&gt;if you’re actively listening and not just reading subtitles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally watched French &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; videos to practice listening comprehension and “immerse” myself a bit in French culture. You can find a ton of recommendations online for interesting French YouTubers. There’s also the InnerFrench channel for intermediate-level speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;“Le Petit Prince”&lt;/strong&gt; around 9 months in, which was pretty good reading practice. This is the only book I read in French, and I don’t think it was explicitly necessary, but it definitely wasn’t a waste of time. It’s not the easiest book, but I would recommend it to an intermediate learner. Familiarize yourself a bit with the &lt;em&gt;passé simple&lt;/em&gt; beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;changed my phone language to French&lt;/strong&gt; as well, which not only taught me some new words (e.g. stopwatch, settings, unlock) but also put my browser home page in French, which exposed me to a lot of articles in French. Reading these on occasion was good reading practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the &lt;strong&gt;News in French&lt;/strong&gt; e-mail newsletter and read a decent number of the e-mails. I didn’t read anywhere near all of them, but the ones I did read were definitely useful reading practice and taught me many new vocabulary words. The writing is at a relatively advanced level, so I wouldn’t worry much about this until you reach an intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;strong&gt;Learn French with Jessica&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;podcast&lt;/strong&gt; a fair amount as a beginner as well. This podcast is in English, but will help explain some concepts that can be tricky to understand as a beginner (e.g. the weird French counting system, “c’est” vs. “il est”, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more advanced learners, try the &lt;strong&gt;French Voices podcast&lt;/strong&gt;, hosted by the same Jessica mentioned above. This podcast features full-length interviews in French with many interesting Francophones (e.g. movie directors, scientists, etc.) I didn’t listen to this podcast too much, but not for lack of quality – for an advanced student, this podcast will be excellent listening practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally visited the &lt;strong&gt;/r/languagelearning, /r/French, and /r/learnfrench&lt;/strong&gt; subreddits, more so when I was a beginner. Through these subreddits I discovered many of the resources I discussed above, and also learned a decent amount from some of the French-specific posts. In particular, I came back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/a58us6/jai_r%C3%A9ussi_le_defl_b1/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; a few times for inspiration. Once I reached a solid intermediate level, I sometimes visited the &lt;strong&gt;/r/France&lt;/strong&gt; subreddit, which served as interesting reading and taught me some useful vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of other highly recommended resources out there, most of which I never used. At the end of the day, you can mix-and-match whatever resources you want as long as you hit all the major areas: learning vocab, having conversations, covering grammar bases, etc. Here are some other resources that might be worth checking out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimsleur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glossika&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assimil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee Break French podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HelloTalk/Tandem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies or TV shows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books (Harry Potter seems to be a very popular choice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note on movies and shows: this can be a good way to learn things, but I never did this aside from a handful of cartoon episodes early on. However, you must ensure you’re &lt;em&gt;actively learning&lt;/em&gt; and not just being lazy and convincing yourself you’re “studying”. In particular, you should try to avoid subtitles in your native language. Subtitles in your target language are better, but if you can get away with it, not using subtitles is probably the way to go if the content isn’t too much higher than your level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have discussed the resources I recommend, this is a rough outline of what I would recommend for a language learner &lt;em&gt;based on my experience&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, you can find 1000 other people out there with 1000 other learning methods, so feel free to pick and choose. This “study plan” is roughly what I would do if I had to relearn French this year. This is also approximately what I will do for learning Spanish in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, particularly if you are in need of motivation, you can &lt;strong&gt;start looking for French media&lt;/strong&gt; to consume to motivate you to learn the language. For me, this was music, but for others, TV shows or books could also work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I recommend &lt;strong&gt;going through the Duolingo tree&lt;/strong&gt; for getting through the A1 and A2 levels. Completing the French tree should teach you all the major grammatical concepts and you’ll have a very solid basis for moving onto more advanced material. Of course, ensure you’re using Duolingo as I described earlier in this article to get maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting through a good portion (maybe half or so) of the Duolingo tree, &lt;strong&gt;start going through the 5000 most common words Anki deck&lt;/strong&gt;. Do something like 20 new words a day, reviewing words as they come up. If you start Anki late and already know a bunch of words, then you can bump this up to something like 50 words a day, though that’s pretty intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, before finishing Duolingo, &lt;strong&gt;you can start taking Lingoda lessons if you wish&lt;/strong&gt;, probably around the A2 level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you do Lingoda or not, &lt;strong&gt;start Italki lessons&lt;/strong&gt;. If this is your only source of conversation practice, try to take more lessons than otherwise. Once or twice a week is a solid enough rate, but if you’re ambitious you certainly can do more. Having casual conversation is perfectly adequate, as long as you get a bit of variety in conversation topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are near the end of the Duolingo tree, you can &lt;strong&gt;start looking for resources targeted at intermediate users&lt;/strong&gt;. In French, the &lt;strong&gt;InnerFrench podcast&lt;/strong&gt; and YouTube channel are really good for this. You can also start shifting your efforts towards taking more Italki or Lingoda lessons and get more practice speaking and listening, rather than reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, you will almost certainly notice that you struggle with some aspects of grammar. Consult a reputable grammar resource, but don’t bother spending too much time doing grammar exercises. Instead, try to generally understand the concepts and get practice with them through speaking or writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also recommend &lt;strong&gt;writing on Italki Notebooks&lt;/strong&gt; periodically, getting your texts reviewed with Italki tutors if necessary. This should help improve your writing ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermediate phase can be tricky, but I think with enough media consumption at an appropriate level, speaking practice, vocabulary work, and patience, you should be able to push through it. Media consumption includes audio-visual media like listening to music and watching movies, but also activities like &lt;strong&gt;reading books and articles.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to write well, continue writing texts and getting them corrected. Otherwise, be curious and explore what’s out there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rinse and repeat the last step until B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m only at a B2 level, I imagine getting to C1 (and eventually C2) is the result of continually accumulating more knowledge and resolving weaknesses. For example, you need to learn more technical vocabulary and internalize certain rare grammatical features, things which, at my level, I have not done. Continue to practice speaking and listening skills, and consume a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of native content in order to know all the little idioms and expressions that feature prominently in true fluency. Immersion likely becomes increasingly helpful to reach these levels, although I suspect you can reach at least a solid C1 at home without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your budget is tight, here are some tips to minimize your spending while learning your language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is free and unlimited on the desktop version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italki offers a “Language Exchange” section where you can freely exchange lessons with a native speaker of your target language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lingoda offers a free trial, if you want to check out their resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise I think everything else is essentially free or not really necessary. You won’t be able to do everything as easily as someone with a big budget, but I think there are enough free resources out there to get to a relatively high level without spending any money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do have a little bit of money to spend, then I highly recommend using that money to find teachers on Italki. For many languages you can find cheap tutors, in the $5-$8/hr range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though French is notorious for being difficult to pronounce, I actually didn’t have too much difficulty developing good pronunciation. Starting with the first time I spoke French online about two months in, I received compliments on my accent, and even though I made some minor mistakes here and there, things were generally pretty good. I think I got a bit lucky with this part of learning French, but I’ll give some tips about this anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that “curiosity” and “independence” were really important qualities to have when self-studying a language like I did. I think much of my success regarding developing good pronunciation was really taking charge of figuring out what proper pronunciation was and how to produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started learning French on Duolingo, I often repeated what I heard out loud to get myself used to pronouncing French words. I replayed and repeated after audio over and over again until I felt comfortable with the pronunciation, to the dismay of some friends who witnessed this. Sometimes things weren’t so clear (Duolingo audio isn’t perfect, though it has gotten better) and other times words were too difficult to pronounce for me (e.g. “voiture” was really hard for a while), but for many of the easier words, I ended up doing decently enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also read many articles and watched many videos online about French pronunciation, especially trying to train myself to produce some difficult French sounds, like the “u” and “r”. While I struggled with these for a while, after a month or two I could do them reasonably well. This took a lot of consistent effort trying to produce these sounds, but eventually things started falling into place. Singing French songs in particular helped me practice pronunciation, and in fact the “r” finally clicked for me while I was singing a Stromae song (say “retrouverai” enough times and you’ll figure it out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you feel silly saying things, at some point you need to force yourself to practice pronouncing them. People who pay attention to pronunciation and force themselves to correct their errors are much more likely to improve than those that are too afraid to sound dumb. If you don’t want to sound dumb, language learning is not for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For French learners, here are some specific observations about pronunciation that could help you, which were pain points for me in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasal vowels, particularly the difference between “-an” and “–in”. I practiced differentiating between “attendre”, “étendre”, “éteindre”, and “atteindre” pretty often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, the difference between “é” and “è”. It’s subtle and takes a while to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pronunciation of “s”. Note “s” is pronounced differently as “ss”, “s” at the end of a word, and “s” not at the end of a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“in-” and “im-” at the beginning of words are pronounced differently depending on the next letter in the word. For example, “insensible” and “imparfait” vs. “inevitable” and “innovation”. See if you can figure out the pattern!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liaisons. You’ll develop an ear for this over time but it’s definitely quite tricky. Read some articles online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“-oy“ is not pronounced like in “boy” but kind of like “waee”, e.g. in “voyager” or “tutoyer”. “Voyage” sounds like “vwaee-ahj”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to pronounce “plus” based on the context. Honestly I still don’t know this completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I find French pronunciation to be surprisingly consistent given its reputation. While it’s often impossible to know how a word is spelled just from hearing it, you can usually know how a word is pronounced after seeing it once you get the hang of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning French was an immensely rewarding process for me. It opened up an entire new cultural world to me and instilled in me a love for language learning. While it required a lot of time and hard work, in the end, I think learning a language (especially an “easy” one like French for English speakers) isn’t “hard” in the way that, for example, theoretical physics is “hard”. With enough dedication and effective practice, pretty much anyone can learn a foreign language to a reasonably high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a year is a pretty aggressive timeline to learn a language to a high level, it’s clearly entirely feasible if you’re willing to put the time in and work efficiently. I hope my experiences help you on your language learning journey. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Take Smart Notes</title>
<link>https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I long ago stopped reading books on note-taking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were always too vague and boring, full of platitudes that had little to do with the world outside academia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I especially avoided “how-to” style books on the subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They would often list dozens of tips and tricks that had little to do with each other. There was never an overarching system for turning notes into concrete results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But recently I picked up&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2tPBYkt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How To Take Smart Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(affiliate link)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/soenke_ahrens&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sönke Ahrens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Ahrens is a Lecturer in Philosophy of Education at the University of Duisburg-Essen and also coaches students, academics, and professionals with a focus on time management, decision-making, and personal growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is by far the most impactful and profound book I’ve ever read on the subject. I was astounded to encounter in its pages (with uncanny similarity) many of the same principles I had discovered over 10 years of personal experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book is so full of insights that it broke my usual approach to summarizing books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My approach is based on the assumption that most books are a few morsels of real insight wrapped in layers and layers of fluff. As I read, I systematically unravel those layers of fluff and extract only those insights, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this book is not written in the usual way. It is written using an external thinking system, which I call a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second Brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The evidence is clear: Instead of squeezing as many pages as possible out of one idea,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How To Take Smart Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;squeezes as many ideas as possible onto every page. Every paragraph has a point, and I struggled to leave anything out of this summary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By identifying the principles that stand the test of time despite huge changes in the underlying technology, we can better understand the essential nature of the creative process. We can focus our efforts on mastering the art of creative note-taking, producing more insightful writing, and fulfilling our full potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How To Take Smart Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;is a book on note-taking for students, academics, and non-fiction writers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It promises to help readers adopt “a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.” By adopting such a system, Ahrens promises that we will be able to “efficiently turn our thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While producing published written works is the end goal, is it not the only goal. Ahrens argues convincingly that turning one’s thoughts into writing isn’t just useful for writers but for anyone who wants to improve their thinking and learning in general.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By focusing on writing, Ahrens is able to speak in concrete terms about a specific creative process while simultaneously drawing universal conclusions. Instead of notes becoming a “graveyard for thoughts,” they can become a life-long pool of rich and interconnected ideas we can draw on no matter where our interests lead us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ahrens’ approach to note-taking was inspired by the 20th-century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998). Luhmann was a prolific note-taker, writer, and academic. Early in his academic career, Luhmann realized that a note was only as valuable as its&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– its network of associations, relationships, and connections to other information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He developed a simple system based on paper index cards, which he called his “slip-box” (or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;zettelkasten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;in German). It was designed to connect any given note to as many different potentially relevant contexts as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luhmann rejected alphabetical categorization of his notes, along with fixed categories like the Dewey Decimal System. He intended his notes not just for a single project or book but for a lifetime of reading and researching. He designed his slip-box as a research database made up of index cards (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;zettel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;) that were “thematically unlimited” and could be infinitely extended in any direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Although it appeared to be just a simple filing system made up of index cards, Luhmann’s slip-box grew to become an equal thinking partner in his work. He described his system as his secondary memory (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;zweitgedächtnis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;), alter ego, or reading memory (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;lesegedächtnis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;). He reported that it continuously surprised him with ideas he’d forgotten he had. Because of this, he claimed that there was actual communication going on between himself and his&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;zettelkasten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As he built up his collection of notes, he embarked on a series of achievements that would eventually make him one of the most influential sociologists and scientists of the 20th century. &lt;/span&gt;

It begins “1 Introduction; It must be attempted to explain the criteria and concepts as clearly as is possible so that their inadequacy and imperfection becomes clear.” [Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2012/01/luhmanns-first-slip.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Taking Note blog&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Here’s how it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;worked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luhmann wrote down interesting or potentially useful ideas he encountered in his reading on uniformly sized index cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;He wrote only on one side of each card to eliminate the need to flip them over, and he limited himself to one idea per card so they could be referenced individually&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each new index card received a sequential number, starting at 1. When a new source was added to that topic, or he found something to supplement it, he would add new index cards with letters as suffixes (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;These branching connections were marked in red as close as possible to the point where the branch began&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any of these branches could also have their own branches. The card for fellow German sociologist Jürgen Habermas, for example, was labeled 21/3d26g53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;As he read, he would create new cards, update or add comments to existing ones, create new branches from existing cards, and create new links between cards on different “strands”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows how subtopics branched off from main topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Not only did this create a system that could extend infinitely in any direction, but it also gave each index card a permanent ID number. This number could be referenced from any other card, because it would never change. The branches created “strands” of thought that one could enter at any point, following it downstream to be elaborated upon or upstream to its source. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also led to a meaningful topography within the system: Topics that had been extensively explored had long reference numbers, making their length informative on its own. There is no hierarchy in the zettelkasten, which means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme. By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over his 30-year career, Luhmann published 58 books and hundreds of articles on the way to completing his two-volume masterwork,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Society of Society&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;(1997). It presented a radical new theory that not only changed sociology but also provoked heated discussions in philosophy, education, political theory, and psychology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the importance of Luhmann’s slip-box was underestimated. As early as 1985, he would regularly point to it as the source of his amazing productivity: “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142). Until recently, no one believed that such a simple system could produce such prolific output. We are so used to the idea that great outcomes require great (and complicated) efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Luhmann often remarked that he never forced himself to do anything he didn’t feel like doing: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wouldn’t it make sense that such output over so many years would be possible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;because&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;it was simple and easy, not in spite of it? Upon his death, Luhmann’s slip-box contained 90,000 notes. This may seem like a staggering number until you realize that it amounts to only six notes per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s look deeper at the main principles that Luhmann used in his work, which Ahrens has adapted to the modern age. The explosion of technology and connectivity has inundated us with an overabundance of information. These principles go a long way toward reestablishing the boundaries and constraints that creativity needs to thrive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing doesn’t begin when we sit down to put one paragraph after another on the screen or page. It begins much, much earlier, as we take notes on the articles or books we read, the podcasts or audiobooks we listen to, and the interesting conversations and life experiences we have. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These notes build up as a byproduct of the reading we’re already doing anyway. Even if you don’t aim to develop a grand theory, you need a way to organize your thoughts and keep track of the information you consume. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to learn and remember something long-term, you have to write it down. If you want to understand an idea, you have to translate it into your own words. If we have to do this writing anyway, why not use it to build up resources for future publications? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing is not only for proclaiming fully formed opinions, but for developing opinions worth sharing in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing works well in improving one’s thinking because it forces you to engage with what you’re reading on a deeper level. Just because you read more doesn’t automatically mean you have more or better ideas. It’s Iike learning to swim – you have to learn by doing it, not by merely reading about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as you will already have learned what you understand. When you truly understand something, it is anchored to a latticework of related ideas and meanings, which makes it far easier to remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, you could memorize the fact that arteries are red and veins are blue. But it is only when you understand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;why&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– that arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body, while veins carry blood low in oxygen back to the heart – that that fact has any value. And once we make this meaningful connection between ideas, it’s hard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to remember it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious. It requires&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;elaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– we need to copy, translate, re-write, compare, contrast, and describe a new idea in our own terms. We have to view the idea from multiple perspectives and answer questions such as “How does this fact fit with others I already know?” and “How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory?” or “How does this argument compare to that one?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Completing these tasks is exceedingly difficult inside the confines of our heads. We need an external medium in which to perform this elaboration, and writing is the most effective and convenient one ever invented. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second principle extends the previous one even further: Do you work as if writing is the only thing that matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In academia and science, virtually all research is aimed at eventual publication Ahrens notes that “there is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The purpose of research is to produce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;knowledge that can be scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And once it is, what the author meant doesn’t matter – only the actual words written on the page matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This principle requires us to expand our definition of “publication” beyond the usual narrow sense. Few people will ever publish their work in an academic journal or even on a blog. But everything that we write down and share with someone else counts: notes we share with a friend, homework we submit to a professor, emails we write to our colleagues, and presentations we deliver to clients all count as knowledge made public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This might still seem like a radical principle. Should we publicize even the ideas we’ve only just encountered, or opinions half-formed, or wild theories we can’t substantiate? Do we really need even more people broadcasting half-baked opinions and theories online?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the important part is the principle: Work&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;as if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;writing is the only thing that matters. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you consume information completely changes the way you engage with it. You’ll be more focused, more curious, more rigorous, and more demanding. You won’t waste time writing down every detail, trying to make a perfect record of everything that was said. Instead, you’ll try to learn the basics as efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are working toward publication. You’ll read differently, becoming more focused on the parts most relevant to the argument you’re building. You’ll ask sharper questions, no longer satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in logic. You’ll naturally seek venues to present your work, since the feedback you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You’ll begin to act more deliberately, thinking several steps beyond what you’re reading to consider its implications and potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deliberate practice is the best way to get better at anything, and in this case, you are deliberately practicing the most fundamental skill of all: thinking. Even if you never actually publish one line of writing, you will vastly improve every aspect of your thinking when you do everything as if nothing counts except writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most damaging myths about creativity is that it starts from nothing. The blank page, the white canvas, the empty dance floor: Our most romantic and universal artistic motifs seem to suggest that “starting from scratch” is the essence of creativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This belief is reinforced by how writing is typically taught: We are told to “pick a topic” as a necessary first step, then to conduct research, discuss and analyze it, and finally come to a conclusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how can you decide on an interesting topic before you’ve read about it? You have to immerse yourself in research before you even know how to formulate a good question. And the decision to read about one subject versus another also doesn’t appear out of thin air. It usually comes from an existing interest or understanding. The truth is every intellectual endeavor starts with a predicting conception.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the tension at the heart of the creative process: You have to research&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;you pick what you will write about. Ideally, you should start researching long before, so you have weeks and months and even years of rich material to work with as soon as you decide on a topic. This is why an external system to record your research is so critical. It doesn’t just enhance your writing process; it makes it possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And all this pre-research also involves writing. We build up an ever-growing pool of externalized thoughts as we read. When the time comes to produce, we aren’t following a blindly invented plan plucked from our unreliable brains. We look in our notes and follow our interests, curiosity, and intuition, which are informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, and taking notes. We never again have to face that blank screen with the impossible demand of “thinking of something to write about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one ever really starts from scratch. Anything they come up with has to come from prior experience, research, or other understanding. But because they haven’t acted on this fact, they can’t track ideas back to their origins. They have neither supporting material nor accurate sources. Since they haven’t been taking notes from the start, they either have to start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their steps (which is boring).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s no wonder that nearly every guide to writing begins with “brainstorming.” If you don’t have notes, you have no other option. But this is a bit like a financial advisor telling a 65-year-old to start saving for retirement – too little, too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking notes allows you to break free from the traditional, linear path of writing. It allows you to systematically extract information from linear sources, mix and shake them up together until new patterns emerge, and then turn them back into linear texts for others to consume. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’ll know you’ve succeeded in making this shift when the problem of not having enough to write about is replaced by the problem of having far too much to write about. When you finally arrive at the decision of what to write about, you’ll already have made that decision again and again at every single step along the way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just because writing is not a linear process doesn’t mean we should go about it haphazardly. We need a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;workflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– a repeatable process for collecting, organizing, and sharing ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing is often taught as a collation of “tips and tricks” – brainstorm ideas, make an outline, use a three-paragraph structure, repeat the main points, use vivid examples, set a timer. Each one in isolation might make sense, but without the holistic perspective of how they fit together, they add more work than they save. Every additional technique becomes its own project without bringing the whole much further forward. Before long, the whole mess of techniques falls apart under its own weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is only when all the work becomes part of an integrated process that it becomes more than the sum of its parts. Even the best techniques won’t make a difference if they are used in conflicting ways. This is why the slip-box isn’t yet another technique. It is the system in which all the techniques are linked together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Good systems don’t add options and features; they strip away complexity and distractions from the main work, which is thinking. An undistracted brain and a reliable collection of notes is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ahrens uses the excellent analogy of how the invention of shipping containers revolutionized international trade to demonstrate the role of note-taking in modern writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Container shipping is a simple idea: ship products in standardized containers instead of loading them onto ships haphazardly as had always been done. But it took multiple failed attempts before it was successful, because it wasn’t actually about the container, which after all is just a box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The potential of the shipping container was only unleashed when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;every other part&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of the shipping supply chain was changed to accommodate it. From manufacturing to packaging to final delivery, the design of ships, cranes, trucks, and harbors all had to align around moving containers as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once they did, international shipping exploded, setting the stage for Asia to become an economic power among many other historic changes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people still take notes, if at all, in an ad-how, random way. If they see a nice sentence, they underline it. If they want to make a comment, they write it in the margins. If they have a good idea, they write it in whichever notebook is close at hand. And if an article seems important enough, they might make the effort to save an excerpt. This leaves them with many different kinds of notes in many different places and formats. This means when it comes time to write, they first have to undertake a massive project to collect and organize all these scattered notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notes are like shipping containers for ideas. Instead of inventing a new way to take notes for every source you read, use a completely standardized and predictable format every time. It doesn’t matter what the notes contain, which topic they relate to, or what medium they arrived through – you treat each and every note exactly the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is this standardization of notes that enables a critical mass to build up in one place. Without a standard format, the larger the collection grows, the more time and energy have to be spent navigating the ever-growing inconsistencies between them. A common format removes unnecessary complexity and takes the second-guessing out of the process. Like LEGOs, standardized notes can easily be shuffled around and assembled into endless configurations without losing sight of what they contain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same principle applies to the steps of processing our notes. Consider that no single step in the process of turning raw ideas into finished pieces of writing is particularly difficult. It isn’t very hard to write down notes in the first place. Nor is turning a group of notes into an outline very demanding. It also isn’t much of a challenge to turn a working outline full of relevant arguments into a rough draft. And polishing a well-conceived rough draft into a final draft is trivial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if each individual step is so easy, why do we find the overall experience of writing so grueling? Because we try to do all the steps at once. Each of the activities that make up “writing” – reading, reflecting, having ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting, and rewriting – require a very different kind of attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proofreading requires very focused, detail-oriented attention, while choosing which words to put down in the first place might require a more open, free-floating attention. When looking for interesting connections between notes, we often need to be in a playful, curious state of mind, whereas when putting them in logical order, our state of mind probably needs to be more serious and precise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The slip-box is the host of the process outlined above. It provides a place where distinct batches of work can be created, worked on, and saved permanently until the next time we are ready to deploy that particular kind of attention. It deliberately puts distance between ourselves and what we’ve written, which is essential for evaluating it objectively. It is far easier to switch between the role of creator and critic when there is a clear separation between them, and you don’t have to do both at the same time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By standardizing and streamlining both the format of our notes and the steps by which we process them, the real work can come to the forefront: thinking, reflecting, writing, discussing, testing, and sharing. This is the work that adds value, and now we have the time to do it more effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A workflow is similar to a chemical reaction: It can feed on itself, becoming a virtuous cycle where the positive experience of understanding a text motivates us to take on the next task, which helps us get better at what we’re doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy our work, and so on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nothing motivates us more than becoming better at what we do. And we can only become better when we intentionally expose our work to high-quality feedback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many forms of feedback, both internal and external – from peers, from teachers, from social media, and from rereading our own writing. But notes are the only kind of feedback that is available anytime you need it. It is the only way to deliberately practice your thinking and communication skills multiple times per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is easy to think we understand a concept until we try to put it in our own words. Each time we try, we practice the core skill of insight: distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don’t. The better we become at it, the more efficient and enjoyable our reading becomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feedback also helps us adjust our expectations and predictions about how much we can get done in an hour or a day. Instead of sitting down to the amorphous task of “writing,” we dedicate each working session to concrete tasks that can be finished in a reasonable timeframe: Write three notes, review two paragraphs, check five sources for an essay, etc. At the end of the day, we know exactly how much we accomplished (or didn’t accomplish) and can adjust our future expectations accordingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is only when you have multiple, simultaneous projects and interests that the full potential of an external thinking system is realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of the last time you read a book. Perhaps you read it for a certain purpose – to gain some familiarity with a topic you’re interested in or find insights for a project you’re working on. What are the chances that the book contains only the precise insights you were looking for, and no others? Extremely low it would seem. We encounter a constant stream of new ideas, but only a tiny fraction of them will be useful and relevant to us at any given moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the only way to find out which insights a book contains is to read it, you might as well read and take notes productively. Spending a little extra time to record the best ideas you encounter – whether or not you know how they will ultimately be used – vastly increases the chances that you will “stumble upon” them in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to increase the chances of such future accidental encounters is a powerful one, because the best ideas are usually ones we haven’t anticipated. The most interesting topics are the ones we didn’t plan on learning about. But we can anticipate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;fact and set our future selves up for a high probability of productive “accidents.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that you’ve been collecting notes on you’re reading, how should you organize them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The classic mistake is to organize them into ever more specific topics and subtopics. This makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes overwhelming. The more notes pile up, the smaller and narrower the subtopics become, limiting your ability to see meaningful connections between them. With this approach, the greater one’s collection of notes, the less accessible and useful they become.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of organizing by topic and subtopic, it is much more effective to organize by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Specifically, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;context in which it will be used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The primary question when deciding where to put something becomes “In which context will I want to stumble upon this again?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came from, you file them according to where they’re going. This is the essential difference between organizing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;like a librarian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and organizing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;like a writer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A librarian asks “Where should I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;this note?” Their goal is to maintain a taxonomy of knowledge that is accessible to everyone, which means they have to use only the most obvious categories. They might file notes on a psychology paper under “misjudgments,” “experimental psychology,” or “experiments.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That works fine for a library, but not for a writer. No pile of notes filed uniformly under “psychology” will be easy to turn into a paper. There is no variation or disagreement from which an interesting argument could arise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A writer asks “In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note?” They will file it under a paper they are writing, a conference they are speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a colleague. These are concrete, near-term deliverables and not abstract categories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizing by context does take a little bit of thought. The answer isn’t always immediately obvious. A book about personal finance might interest me for completely different reasons if I am a politician working on a campaign speech, a financial advisor trying to help a client, or an economist developing monetary policy. If I encounter a novel engineering method, it may be useful for completely different reasons depending on whether I am working on an engineering textbook, a skyscraper, or a rocket booster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writers don’t think about a single, “correct” location for a piece of information. They deal in “scraps” which can often be repurposed and reused elsewhere. The discarded byproducts from one piece of writing may become the essential pillars of the next one. The slip-box is a thinking tool, not an encyclopedia, so completeness is not important. The only gaps we do need to be concerned about are the gaps in the final manuscript we are working toward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By saving all the byproducts of our writing, we collect all the future material we might need in one place. This approach sets up your future self with everything they need to work as decisively and efficiently as possible. They won’t need to trawl through folder after folder looking for all the sources they need. You’ll already have done that work for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ahrens notes that in most cases, students fail not because of a lack of ability, but because they lose a personal connection to what they are learning:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is why we must spend as much time as possible working on things we find interesting. It is not an indulgence. It is an essential part of asking our work sustainable and thus successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are taught. We are told to “make a plan” upfront and in detail. Success is then measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The history of science is full of stories of accidental discoveries. Ahrens gives the example of the team that discovered the structure of DNA. It started with a grant, but not a grant to study DNA. They were awarded funds to find a treatment for cancer. As they worked, the team followed their intuition and interest, developing the actual research program along the way (Rheinberger 1997). If they stuck religiously to their original plan, they probably wouldn’t have discovered a cure for cancer and certainly wouldn’t have discovered the structure of DNA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant. According to a 2006 study by psychology professor Arlen Moller, “When people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice [of what to work on], their energy for subsequent tasks was not diminished” (Moller 2006, 1034). In other words, when we have a choice about what to work on and when, it doesn’t take as much willpower to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our sense of motivation depends on making consistent forward progress. But in creative work, questions change and new directions emerge. That is the nature of insight. So we don’t want to work according to a rigid workflow that is threatened by the unexpected. We need to be able to make small, constant adjustments to keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By breaking down the work of writing into discrete steps, getting quick feedback on each one, and always following the path that promises the most insight, unexpected insights can become the driving force of our work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luhmann never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him: “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” As in martial arts, if you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it but instead redirect it towards another productive goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working with a slip-box naturally leads us to save ideas that are contradictory or paradoxical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s much easier to develop an argument from a lively discussion of pros and cons rather than a litany of one-sided arguments and perfectly fitting quotes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our only criterion for what to save is whether it connects to existing ideas and adds to the discussion. When we focus on open connections, disconfirming or contradictory data suddenly becomes very valuable. It often raises new questions and opens new paths of inquiry. The experience of having one piece of data completely change your perspective can be exhilarating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real enemy of independent thinking is not any external authority, but our own inertia. We need to find ways to counteract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– our tendency to take into account only information that confirms what we already believe. We need to regularly confront our errors, mistakes, and misunderstandings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By taking notes on a wide variety of sources and in objective formats that exist outside our heads, we practice the skill of seeing what is really there and describing it plainfully and factually. By saving ideas that aren’t compatible with each other and don’t necessarily support what we already think, we train ourselves to develop subtle theories over time instead of always jumping to conclusions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By playing with a concept, stretching and reconceiving and remixing it, we become less attached to how it was originally presented. We can extract certain aspects or details for our own uses. With so many ideas at our disposal, we are no longer threatened by the possibility that a new idea will undermine existing ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working with a slip-box can be disheartening, because you are constantly faced with the gaps in your understanding. But at the same time, it increases the chances that you will actually move the work forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our choice then is whether we want to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;smarter or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;smarter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Students in most educational institutions are not encouraged to independently build a network of connections between different kinds of information. They aren’t taught how to organize the very best and most relevant knowledge they encounter in a long-term way across many topics. Most tragically of all, they aren’t taught to follow their interests and take the most promising path in their research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, learning should not be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. It is about becoming a different kind of person with a different way of thinking. The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: We build the same connections in our heads as we deliberately develop them in our slip-box. Writing then is best seen not only as a tool for thinking but as a tool for personal growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How To Take Smart Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing</og:title>
<og:url>https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/</og:url>

&lt;h2&gt;About Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any obstacles I can remove for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As your manager, what would you like me to stop, start, or continue doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what point in the past week were you most frustrated with or discouraged by your work? What can I do to help you manage that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel you’re getting enough feedback? Why/why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have any feedback for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you think that you receive enough feedback? Is feedback helpful for your personal development? What can I do to help you get the feedback you want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I better support you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I make your days more fulfilling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I do a better job communicating with you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you prefer to receive feedback?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might I make this project more challenging or interesting for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd like to improve as a manager and I could really use your help. Next week, would you be willing to share some feedback on one to two things you think I could do better as your manager?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were me, what changes would you make?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to make my 1-on-1s better and would appreciate your honest feedback on this one — what did you like about it, and what could be improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed that our last several 1-on-1s have stayed pretty surface. What are your honest impressions of this meeting? What could we be doing differently or better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What additional resources can I provide for you between now and the next time we meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your impressions of our 1-on-1s? What could we do differently or better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on my changes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspect of your job you would like more help or coaching?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What can I be doing better to help you in your job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do as a manager to make your work easier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do better or differently as your manager to support you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do for you that I'm not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do to help remove obstacles?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What can I do to help you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do to make things more manageable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do to make your job easier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could I do as a manager to make your work easier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you like about my management style? What do you dislike?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think I should know about the project, but might not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have your past managers done that you’d like me to also do or not do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is something I could do better? What feedback do you have for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is something I could have done better? What are the situations that I could have helped more but didn’t?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the biggest challenge you are currently facing? How can I help with that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the one thing that you need the most from me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the percentage of my involvement in your daily tasks? Would you prefer more or less?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would you like to know about me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would you like to see change about these discussions? How could we make them more useful for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s your favorite thing I do as a manager of this team I should keep doing?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Would you like more coaching? What aspect of your job do you like more help and coaching on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Career development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Do you have the tools you need to reach your goals?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How do you think you did on your performance review this year? What do you think the results will be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is your current work helping or hurting your professional development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were to create your ideal position, how would it differ from what you are currently doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine it’s two years from now, and things have gone well: What has been your role in that? What does your role look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a different way we can develop your skills outside of traditional training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an aspect of your job you would like more help or coaching?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about something new you learned since we met last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help identify and clarify the goal: What do you want to achieve? What will you do to achieve it? When will you do it? Who do you need to involve? When should you see results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about this goal is important to you and what will be different when you achieve the goal?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What parts of your job would you like to deepen your skills in or get additional training in?&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Photographer sues Getty Images for $1B for being billed for her own photo (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-getty-copyright-20160729-snap-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-getty-copyright-20160729-snap-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Carol Highsmith is a distinguished photographer who has traveled all over America, aiming to chronicle for posterity the life of the nation in the early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. She’s donating her work to the public via the Library of Congress, which has called her act “one of the &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0712/gift.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greatest acts of generosity&lt;/a&gt; in the history of the Library.” The Carol M. Highsmith Archive, which is expected ultimately to encompass more than 100,000 images, is accessible royalty-free &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/highsm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;via the library’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one can imagine Highsmith’s reaction last December when she got &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3001352-Lcs-Threat.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a threatening letter&lt;/a&gt; from a firm associated with the photo licensing agency Getty Images, accusing her of license infringement by posting one of her own images online. The firm demanded a “settlement payment” of $120 from &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thisisamericafoundation.org/#s=0&amp;amp;p=-1&amp;amp;a=0&amp;amp;at=0&amp;amp;mi=1&amp;amp;pt=0&amp;amp;pi=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her nonprofit This Is America! Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, backed up by the implicit threat to take her to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Quote&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty misrepresents the terms and conditions of using the Highsmith Photos by falsely claiming a user must buy a copyright license from Getty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highsmith vs. Getty, New York federal court&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, one doesn’t have to imagine Highsmith’s reaction. One can read all about it in &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3001353/Filed-Complaint-Exhibits.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the lawsuit she filed&lt;/a&gt; this week against Getty in New York federal court, accusing the agency of illicitly claiming rights to 18,755 of her photographs and seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The lawsuit also names Alamy, a British-based licensing agency that was purportedly the license holder whose rights were infringed. Neither Getty nor Alamy had the right to claim a license or copyright on her photos, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter came from License Compliance Services, an arm of Getty Images. Getty &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/photographer-sues-getty-images-for-selling-photos-she-donated-to-public/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claimed to Cyrus Farivar of Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; that LCS and Getty have “no operational relationship,” but Highsmith’s lawyers say that’s dubious. The two companies share corporate quarters in Seattle, as well as three top executives, they observe in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highsmith, 70, found several aspects of Getty’s behavior especially irksome, beyond the fact that the agency “misrepresents the terms and conditions of using the Highsmith Photos by falsely claiming a user must buy a copyright license from Getty” in order to use them. (Indeed, numerous publications, including The Times, have used Highsmith images with credits to Getty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0ad5672/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/840x473!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb5%2F92f7b560dd9256978236bb713a4b%2Fla-1469816884-snap-photo&quot; alt=&quot;After Carol Highsmith’s nonprofit foundation got a demand letter for $120 for using this photo she had donated to the public, she sued. The Getty Images watermark asserts rights it doesn’t have, she says. &quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;473&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Figure-content&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Carol Highsmith’s nonprofit foundation got a demand letter for $120 for using this photo she had donated to the public, she sued. The Getty Images watermark asserts rights it doesn’t have, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Carol Highsmith )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty nowhere identified Highsmith as the sole creator or copyright owner of the photographs it was hawking to the public. Nor did it volunteer to its clients that the photographs were available for free, in high-quality digital format, from the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could damage her own reputation, Highsmith says, since it could look as if she’s been trying to profit from images she had ostensibly donated to the public: “Anyone who sees the Highsmith Photos and knows or learns of her gift to the Library could easily believe her to be a hypocrite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Getty nor Alamy has filed a formal answer to the lawsuit. In a public statement, however, Getty &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://press.gettyimages.com/statement-regarding-highsmith-claim/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;responded with bluster&lt;/a&gt;. The agency says the lawsuit is “based on a number of misconceptions” and plans to “defend [itself] vigorously.” It acknowledges that the images are in the public domain, but still maintains that it has the right to charge a fee for distributing the material. “Distributing and providing access to public domain content is different to asserting copyright ownership of it,” Getty says. That’s true as far as it goes, but skates over the question of who gave it permission to distribute the content on any terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/popular/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the most-read stories this hour »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alamy has said even less. An employee at its Brooklyn office said, “We’re looking into it and haven’t got any further comment.” Both agencies appear to have taken Highsmith’s photos off their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Getty and Alamy were thinking is unclear for the moment. But the case certainly underscores the confusion rampant in the world of digital rights. When images and content can be snarfed off the Web with a keystroke or the click of a mouse and reproduced in any format one wishes, who really can know who owns what? The path is wide open not only for stealing material with abandon, but for asserting rights illegitimately, as Highsmith says happened here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty Images should be especially sensitive to the pitfalls of charging for rights it doesn’t own. Not only is it a professional agency that makes its living in the digital field, but it has been caught infringing digital rights before — in fact, its position as an alleged recidivist infringer is what allowed Highsmith to claim damages of more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/760fded/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/840x473!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2F50%2Ff54de6bdb16745fa0d68a23ff873%2Fla-1469822409-snap-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Florence Owens Thompson, Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” &quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;473&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Figure-content&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Owens Thompson, Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dorothea Lange, Library of Congress )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a federal court jury found that Getty and Agence France-Press had “willfully infringed” a photographer’s copyright on eight photos from the 2010 Haiti earthquake that the photographer posted on Twitter, but had been reposted without permission by another photographer. Getty conceded liability and, along with AFP, was slapped with $1.5 million in damages.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shame of the Highsmith case is that she has shown herself to be a most public-spirited artist. Her photographs, often awe-inspiring in their drama and color palette, amount to a rich snapshot of the people, structures and landscapes of America. She began donating her work in 1992, focused on an ambition to visit every state in the union. Her donations serve a tradition established by Dorothea Lange, the Depression-era photographer whose travels for the New Deal Farm Security Administration yielded an indelible portrait of America in its time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lange’s 1936 photograph of migrant mother Florence Owens Thompson of Nipomo, Cal., for instance, is a historical icon that belongs to the nation. If you wish to reproduce it, you can download it from Getty Images, for &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gettyimages.com/license/128589880&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a fee that might exceed $5,000&lt;/a&gt;. Or, like Highsmith’s photos, you can download it for free from the Library of Congress, with no restrictions. The choice is yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;As of today i can't view a whole bunch of reddits anymore with the iphone safari browser. They only say &quot;this community is available in the app&quot;. As if the endless popups and messages for the reddit app throughout the years haven't been enough, now i simply can't view them at all unless i use that app of yours?? It's like Reddit is becoming Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
