<title>Post Mortem of Google Outage on 14 December 2020</title>
<link>http://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20013#20013004</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20013#20013004</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday 14 December, 2020, for a duration of 47 minutes, customer-facing Google services that required Google OAuth access were unavailable. Cloud Service accounts used by GCP workloads were not impacted and continued to function. We apologize to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google User ID Service maintains a unique identifier for every account and handles authentication credentials for OAuth tokens and cookies. It stores account data in a distributed database, which uses Paxos protocols to coordinate updates. For security reasons, this service will reject requests when it detects outdated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google uses an evolving suite of automation tools to manage the quota of various resources allocated for services. As part of an ongoing migration of the User ID Service to a new quota system, a change was made in October to register the User ID Service with the new quota system, but parts of the previous quota system were left in place which incorrectly reported the usage for the User ID Service as 0. An existing grace period on enforcing quota restrictions delayed the impact, which eventually expired, triggering automated quota systems to decrease the quota allowed for the User ID service and triggering this incident. Existing safety checks exist to prevent many unintended quota changes, but at the time they did not cover the scenario of zero reported load for a single service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Quota changes to large number of users, since only a single group was the target of the change,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Lowering quota below usage, since the reported usage was inaccurately being reported as zero,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Excessive quota reduction to storage systems, since no alert fired during the grace period,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Low quota, since the difference between usage and quota exceeded the protection limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the quota for the account database was reduced, which prevented the Paxos leader from writing. Shortly after, the majority of read operations became outdated which resulted in errors on authentication lookups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of the problem was immediately clear as the new quotas took effect. This was detected by automated alerts for capacity at 2020-12-14 03:43 US/Pacific, and for errors with the User ID Service starting at 03:46, which paged Google Engineers at 03:48 within one minute of customer impact. At 04:08 the root cause and a potential fix were identified, which led to disabling the quota enforcement in one datacenter at 04:22. This quickly improved the situation, and at 04:27 the same mitigation was applied to all datacenters, which returned error rates to normal levels by 04:33. As outlined below, some user services took longer to fully recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Review our quota management automation to prevent fast implementation of global changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Improve monitoring and alerting to catch incorrect configurations sooner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Improve reliability of tools and procedures for posting external communications during outages that affect internal tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Evaluate and implement improved write failure resilience into our User ID service database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Improve resilience of GCP Services to more strictly limit the impact to the data plane during User ID Service failures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to apologize for the scope of impact that this incident had on our customers and their businesses. We take any incident that affects the availability and reliability of our customers extremely seriously, particularly incidents which span multiple regions. We are conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and will be making the changes which result from that investigation our top priority in Google Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday 14 December, 2020 from 03:46 to 04:33 US/Pacific, credential issuance and account metadata lookups for all Google user accounts failed. As a result, we could not verify that user requests were authenticated and served 5xx errors on virtually all authenticated traffic. The majority of authenticated services experienced similar control plane impact: elevated error rates across all Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace APIs and Consoles. Products continued to deliver service normally during the incident except where specifically called out below. Most services recovered automatically within a short period of time after the main issue ended at 04:33. Some services had unique or lingering impact, which is detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cloud Console&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any users who hadn't already previously authenticated to Cloud Console were unable to login. Users who had already authenticated may have been able to use Cloud Console but may have seen some features degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google BigQuery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident, streaming requests returned ~75% errors, while BigQuery jobs returned ~10% errors on average globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google Cloud Storage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 15% of requests to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) were impacted during the outage, specifically those using OAuth, HMAC or email authentication. After 2020-12-14 04:31 US/Pacific, the majority of impact was resolved, however, there was lingering impact, for &amp;lt;1% of clients that attempted to finalize resumable uploads that started during the window. These uploads were left in a non-resumable state; the error code GCS returned was retryable, but subsequent retries were unable to make progress, leaving these objects unfinalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google Cloud Networking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking control plane continued to see elevated error rates on operations until it fully recovered at 2020-12-14 05:21 US/Pacific. Only operations that made modifications to the data plane VPC network were impacted. All existing configurations in the data plane remained operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident, ~4% of requests to the GKE control plane API failed, and nearly all Google-managed and customer workloads could not report metrics to Cloud Monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe ~5% of requests to Kubernetes control planes failed but do not have accurate measures due to unreported Cloud Monitoring metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For up to an hour after the outage, ~1.9% nodes reported conditions such as StartGracePeriod or NetworkUnavailable which may have had an impact on user workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google Workspace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Google Workspace services rely on Google's account infrastructure for login, authentication, and enforcement of access control on resources (e.g. documents, Calendar events, Gmail messages). As a consequence, all authenticated Google Workspace apps were down for the duration of the incident. After the issue was mitigated at 2020-12-14 04:32 US/Pacific, Google Workspace apps recovered, and most services were fully recovered by 05:00. Some services, including Google Calendar and Google Workspace Admin Console, served errors up to 05:21 due to a traffic spike following initial recovery. Some Gmail users experienced errors for up to an hour after recovery due to caching of errors from identity services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cloud Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Support's internal tools were impacted, which delayed our ability to share outage communications with customers on the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace Status Dashboards. Customers were unable to create or view cases in the Cloud Console. We were able to update customers at 2020-12-14 05:34 US/Pacific after the impact had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Justin Amash Introduces Bill to End Civil Asset Forfeiture Nationwide</title>
<link>https://reason.com/2020/12/17/justin-amash-introduces-bill-to-end-civil-asset-forfeiture-nationwide/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://reason.com/2020/12/17/justin-amash-introduces-bill-to-end-civil-asset-forfeiture-nationwide/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Justin Amash (L–Mich.) on Thursday introduced a bill to end civil asset forfeiture, which allows the government to take property from someone without ever charging them with a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement on the local, state, and federal levels can seize assets if they were thought to be used in connection with illegal activity. That's often based solely on &lt;em&gt;suspicion, &lt;/em&gt;though. Many people never receive their items back, even if they were acquitted or never charged in the first place. Since 2000, state and local governments have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ij.org/press-release/new-report-finds-civil-forfeiture-rakes-in-billions-each-year-does-not-fight-crime-2/&quot;&gt;robbed people&lt;/a&gt; of more than $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police often deposit those sums into &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2017/09/21/the-secret-slush-funds-of-asset-forfeitu/&quot;&gt;slush funds&lt;/a&gt; for their departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the property seized doesn't necessarily have to have been used by the alleged criminal in question. Such was the case with Kevin McBride, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/08/21/the-cops-took-this-guys-15000-jeep-because-his-girlfriend-allegedly-used-it-for-a-25-marijuana-sale/&quot;&gt;had his Jeep taken&lt;/a&gt; by police in Tucson, Arizona, after his girlfriend allegedly used it to sell $25 worth of weed to an undercover cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amash's bill would eliminate the practice as we know it nationwide. &quot;Civil asset forfeiture is a due process violation, and it always has been,&quot; said Amash in a statement. &quot;Its history is riddled with injustices not because it's a valid practice that gets misused, but because its central premise—denying people their procedural rights—is inherently flawed. By ending it, my bill helps fulfill Congress's obligation to stop rights violations at both the state and federal level, and it ends a practice that contributes to the frayed relationship between law enforcement and the public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be commonsense that civil asset forfeiture plainly violates our constitutional rights, particularly as laid out under the Fourth and 14th Amendments. On the federal level, Amash's bill ends the practice outright. &quot;No person shall be required, under the laws of the United States, to forfeit to the United States any property, real or personal, pursuant to a civil forfeiture proceeding, including a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding,&quot; the bill reads. Such a change would ensure, for instance, that the Drug Enforcement Administration is no longer allowed to seize money at airports, as has been their practice when travelers carry large sums. The agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/09/01/after-the-dea-robbed-her-of-43000-at-an-airport-she-joined-a-class-action-challenging-the-agencys-cash-grabs/&quot;&gt;stole $43,000&lt;/a&gt; from a woman in Wilmington, North Carolina, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/03/04/dea-returns-82k-life-savings-it-seized-from-an-elderly-pittsburgh-man-and-his-daughter/&quot;&gt;$82,373 from an elderly man&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, simply because they dared to fly with it. Neither was ever charged with involvement in the drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation also quashes the practice at the state level by prohibiting governments from taking assets unless they secure a conviction against the alleged criminal or determine via a civil proceeding that the property owner committed the offense begetting forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libertarian congressman, who is retiring after this session, has long been a proponent of criminal justice reform. Earlier this year, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/06/11/justin-amash-tom-mcclintock-republican-cosponsor-tripartisan-support-to-end-qualified-immunity/&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the first bill to abolish qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that makes it difficult to hold public officials accountable for violating your civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Constitution authorizes and obligates each branch of the Federal Government to protect individual rights,&quot; the bill reads. &quot;The long-term failure of Congress, presidents, and the judiciary to recognize the illegitimacy of the government's civil forfeiture practices does not divest them of the authority to do so. The government cannot lawfully jettison the rights of the accused for the sake of convenience and profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I prepared for a decade to graduate in CS in three months</title>
<link>https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-12-18T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/time&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the story of how I prepared for a decade to graduate in 3 months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I dropped out of college, where I was studying computer science, after just one semester. I already knew how to program and I thought I’d never need a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I found myself complaining a lot about it. I saw many opportunities, especially abroad, that were out of reach because I didn’t have the required papers. I felt ready for graduate school but couldn’t get admitted. I had to work harder to prove myself to employers. Although I never noticed any serious gap in my knowledge, I felt that something was missing. I started to resent my decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, I attended a virtual &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/&quot;&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt; meetup. As usual, I complained about not having a degree. This is when I first heard about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wgu.edu/&quot;&gt;Western Governors University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (WGU). Apparently, their online programs had &lt;a href=&quot;https://sive.rs/kimo&quot;&gt;no speed limit&lt;/a&gt; and students could graduate as quickly as they could pass all the exams. I was skeptical, so I did some research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.10337972167&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1.4841628959276&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s accredited&lt;/strong&gt;. Their programs are accredited by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nwccu.org/&quot;&gt;Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)&lt;/a&gt;, the same accreditation body used by the University of Washington (#24) and the University of Oregon (#94).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s self-paced&lt;/strong&gt;. Their competency-based approach allows students to complete courses as quickly as they can show mastery of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s affordable&lt;/strong&gt;. Their flat-rate tuition of $3,200 per 6-month term means that the faster you complete the degree, the more money you save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed too good to be true. I immediately submitted my application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I received a phone call from an enrollment counselor. They confirmed everything I had read and told me that although they didn’t officially accept foreign students (I’m Canadian), they would try to make an exception. After a dozen phone calls, transfer/translation/evaluation of transcripts, proof of English proficiency, and tuition payments, I was officially enrolled in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html&quot;&gt;Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now had the opportunity to apply everything I had learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/&quot;&gt;Scott H. Young’s MIT Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, in which he completed MIT’s 4-year CS curriculum in just 12 months. Of course, my achievement wouldn’t be as impressive, given WGU’s less rigorous program and my prior experience in the field. Indeed, I wrote my first program at 10, I had years of professional experience as a software developer, and I had even studied the subject in college. Still, I would get a real CS degree in just 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will take you through my entire academic journey, describing when, where, and how I completed each of the 34 courses (120 credits) required for this degree. Note that credits awarded for the first 3 courses (9 credits), taken between 2009 and 2012, were excluded from the quoted 3 months and $5000 total. “How I Got a Computer Science Degree in 11 Years for More Than $5000” didn’t sound right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When consulting the tables below, “CUs” stands for “Competency Units”, which is WGU’s time-agnostic equivalent to “Credit Hours”. “Effort” represents the total amount of time (in hours) invested in a given course, from initial research to final assessment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cégep-édouard-montpetit-2009-2012&quot;&gt;Cégep Édouard-Montpetit (2009-2012)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2009 to 2012, I studied IT at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit and graduated with a Diploma of College Studies, which is roughly equivalent to an Associate’s degree in the US. From there, a Bachelor’s degree typically requires an additional 3 years of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripe with the program, other than mandatory class attendance, was its focus on Microsoft technologies: Visual Studio, C#, &lt;span&gt;ASP.NET&lt;/span&gt;, SQL Server, IIS, etc. I was a die-hard Linux user who wrote essays about the evil of proprietary software in high school. Despite my initial resistance, I ended up learning quite a bit. Who knew I would later fall in love with Windows Phone, build a bunch of apps for it (including its first Bitcoin wallet), work as a Xamarin developer, and even spend 3 years porting &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/&quot;&gt;WinUI&lt;/a&gt; to Android and iOS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.uno/&quot;&gt;Uno&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 39 courses, I only managed to transfer 2 courses' worth of credits (6 credits) to WGU. They wouldn’t transfer any IT course. They wouldn’t take my calculus course because it was over 5 years old. Unlike a US Associate’s degree, which would satisfy all of WGU’s general education requirements, my foreign degree wouldn’t. Also, the subject and level of some of the courses were lost in translation, after going through a translation agency (French → English) and an international credential evaluation service (Québec → USA). If I had a recent (less than 5 years old) Associate’s degree, I could have expected to receive 10 courses' worth of credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Start&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Course&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CUs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Satisfied by&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;2009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C464: Introduction to Communication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English Language and Culture&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;2009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C100: Introduction to Humanities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Québec Literature&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;concordia-university-2012&quot;&gt;Concordia University (2012)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I studied computer science at Concordia University and dropped out after 1 semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my first day, I attended 2 lectures. I quickly realized that a 2-hour commute to listen to someone slowly recite a PowerPoint wasn’t the best use of my time. Lectures might exist for good reasons, but I wasn’t sophisticated enough to appreciate them. Instead, I read the PowerPoints myself, at home, and used Wikipedia to fill in the gaps. I only set foot on campus 3 more times, to take the midterm and final exams. Although I passed all 4 courses, I felt very confused about this whole university thing, where you spend a lot of time learning very little. So, I dropped out and gave up my scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 4 courses, I only managed to transfer 1 courses' worth of credits (3 credits) to WGU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Start&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Course&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CUs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Satisfied by&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;2012&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C255: Introduction to Geography&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Introduction to Political Science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;spanstudycomspan-2020&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Study.com&lt;/span&gt; (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, as I was going through WGU’s admission process, I decided to get a head-start by taking some courses online for academic credits. At that point, I was still hoping to graduate in 12 months (2 terms of 6 months). I figured that the more credits I transferred, the more likely I would complete the program in 2 terms. I still had no idea that 1 term would be more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, US students have access to a lot of affordable options when it comes to taking online courses for credits. These are just a few of the many websites that offer courses with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_on_Education&quot;&gt;ACE&lt;/a&gt; credits in the $25-$200 per course range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com&quot;&gt;Study.com&lt;/a&gt; because they had the largest course catalog (180+) and the most comprehensive transfer agreements with WGU. Their College Acceleration Edition plan costs $199/month and includes 2 exams, on top of which you can add up to 3 additional exams per month for $70 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their courses are not the best I’ve taken, but they get the job done. They’re split into bite-size units, each with animated lectures and mandatory quizzes. The number of quizzes can be overwhelming, and I recommend looking elsewhere if you already know the material and just want to take the final exam. Some courses have projects, and most courses have a proctored final exam. Proctoring is done using your computer’s webcam, but the footage is only reviewed 7-10 days later, which can be a problem if you need to transfer credits quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they limit students to 5 courses per month, which is where I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sophia-learning-2020&quot;&gt;Sophia Learning (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, after reaching &lt;span&gt;Study.com&lt;/span&gt;’s monthly 5-course limit, I started looking for alternatives. Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sophia.org&quot;&gt;Sophia Learning&lt;/a&gt; had made all their courses free until the end of July due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of their courses is better than average, and you can even choose from multiple lecturers. Courses are broken down into logical units, each with a set of challenges (quizzes) and a milestone (unit exam). Each course ends with a final milestone which is non-proctored (no webcam) and open-book, making them almost too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to complete 3 courses before the promotion ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;western-governors-university-2020&quot;&gt;Western Governors University (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, I finally started my first and only term at WGU, with 23 courses (83 credits) left to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, I had already passed 9 pre-assessments (practice exams), which unlike course material were already available before the start of the term. On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me realize a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was much more productive and motivated without an arbitrary speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could probably graduate in a single term of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each student at WGU gets assigned a program mentor, who supports them from their first day through graduation. I had a phone call with mine every week, in which we discussed my progress and planned the week ahead. She quickly adapted to my pace of study and made sure I never got stuck waiting for an answer or for the next set of courses to be approved. I never expected that this human point of contact would have such a positive impact on my experience at WGU. Course instructors were also available on-demand, sometimes on surprisingly short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality and difficulty of courses at WGU varies a lot. They’re sourced from different providers, sometimes using different platforms for material and assessments. Some certification courses, such as Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation and Oracle Database SQL 1Z0-071, probably don’t belong in a CS program. On the other hand, a compilers course and a programming languages course would have been welcome additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my prior experience in the field, I was able to skip a lot of material. For 1/5 of courses, I simply ignored the material. For another 3/5 of courses, I quickly skimmed through it. For the last 1/5 of courses, I basically read the whole text book. Sometimes, I prefered third-party resources over the provided material. Fortunately, WGU’s student community curates a lot of them (tips, notes, flashcards, quizzes, abridged text books, YouTube playlists, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each course assesses a student’s competency in 1 of 2 ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Assessment (OA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually takes the form of a single final exam, proctored in real-time using the student’s webcam. Can be scheduled at any time (24/7), even minutes before taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Assessment (PA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually takes the form of one or more projects, submitted by the student for grading. Feedback is returned within 1-3 days, allowing the student to make any required modifications to satisfy all aspects of the rubric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I had some PAs returned for improvements, I made sure to never fail an OA – even if retakes (up to 3-4) were allowed. It wasn’t a race, and my goal wasn’t to brute force my way into a degree. I came for the piece of paper, sure, but I also used it as an opportunity to assess and fill gaps in my knowledge. As a result, I never came close to failing an exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at WGU, I focused on a single course at a time and made sure to complete it before starting a new one. I made some progress every single day (except for one weekend and on my birthday), which I believe was key to maintaining momentum. On average, I studied for 40 hours a week and completed a course every 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, after just over 2 months at WGU, I submitted my capstone project and completed the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From July 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to August 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; (23 days) and from September 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; to November 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; (63 days), I completed 31 courses (111 credits) online across &lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com&quot;&gt;Study.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sophia.org&quot;&gt;Sophia Learning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wgu.edu&quot;&gt;Western Governors University&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with 3 college courses (9 credits) completed between 2009 and 2012 (not accounted for in the 3 months and $5000 total), I received an accredited Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree from Western Governors University for less than $5000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience was very positive overall. Compared to my time at traditional brick and mortar schools, it was night and day. The ability to study when, where, and how you want, without arbitrary speed limits, is extremely empowering. I believe that separating training from testing makes a lot of sense and should be more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to COVID-19, I stayed home the entire time. I wasn’t working either, which meant that I had plenty of undistracted time to study. If I had wanted, I could have done nothing but sleep, eat, and study. However, without a speed limit, I was at risk of burning out. The rapid feedback and progress enabled by these online schools can make learning, or at least taking tests, quite addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn’t stick to any strict schedule, most days looked the same. I did most of my deep work (practice tests, projects, papers, exams) in my home office, which I usually occupied from 10 AM to 5 PM. I often time-blocked study sessions, during which I forced myself not to do anything else. When I finished a course, I usually called it a day. Otherwise, about 6 hours study was all I could take. Then, I usually exercised, showered, cooked, and ate dinner. I rarely studied in the evening, but I occassionally watched lectures. On average, I slept 7 and a half hours a night, which is an hour less than usual. I never came close to burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everything went smoothly, I wouldn’t say it was easy. After all, I invested over 600 hours in this project. But I recognize that it would have been a lot more challenging if I hadn’t been exposed to pretty much the entire curriculum before. Years of programming, watching MIT lectures, reading research papers, refreshing Hacker News, and going down Wikipedia rabbit holes all added up to something. I did learn new things, and it definitely reinforced some existing knowledge, but I wouldn’t say it was transformative. The bulk of the effort was memorizing things that I normally would have Googled. In fact, I might have learned more about learning than about computer science, but the experience was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I never felt rushed, overwhelmed, or stressed. My motivation remained stable the entire time, which I attribute to clear goals and a challenging pace. It gave me confidence and helped me appreciate the power of focus. I’m not sure I could have emulated this experience anywhere else, and I’m very grateful that institutions like WGU exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;numbers&quot;&gt;Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self&quot;&gt;quantified self&lt;/a&gt; enthusiast, I tracked a lot of data while completing this degree, including all invested time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tracked every minute spent on each course/activity related to this degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If necessary, many of these shortcomings can be offset by using the 3+ years you’ve saved to do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/computer-science&quot;&gt;Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) at Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;lt;$10,000).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It took two days to develop Moderna’s vaccine</title>

Still, in the US alone there will probably be another 200,000 deaths before we reach herd immunity. Further, as fast as this vaccine development and deployment was, it’s not clear how much faster it will bring an end to the pandemic. We will likely be 18 months into the pandemic before we have significant vaccine uptake, and that may not be far off from how long the pandemic was going to last in the first place. There is no doubt is will save lives and hasten the end, but still – only after we lost about half a million people to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question for the future, therefore, is this – is it possible to develop a vaccine even more quickly? What if we could get a vaccine out, soup to nuts, in just a couple of months. We could have ended the pandemic before it really began. The first shots could have been going out in March, protecting front-line workers and the most vulnerable. This would have dramatically slowed the spread while the general population got the vaccine. By now we would be at the tail end of distribution, not the beginning. The COVID pandemic which disrupted the world would have been more like a mild flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this feasible? The answer is a definite yes. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11&quot;&gt;as is now being widely reported&lt;/a&gt;, it took Moderna just &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html&quot;&gt;two days to develop their vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. They had the vaccine – in January. This is because Moderna has spent the last 10 years developing the mRNA vaccine technology that they used in their COVID vaccine. This, in fact, is the huge advantage of mRNA vaccines, and partly why this technology was being developed. It worked as designed. As soon as the Chinese government released the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that was all Moderna needed. They identified the sequence for the spike protein, plugged that into their vaccine platform, and voila – an mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Actually, I’m sure it was more complex than that, but whatever the technical details, it took only two days. And the core idea here is valid – they really only needed the genetic sequence of the organism, which itself now can be done very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-12435&quot;/&gt;So what have they been doing for the last 11 months? In short – clinical trials, making sure that the resulting vaccine was in fact safe and effective. The vaccine turned out to be more effective than hoped, about 95% effective in the preliminary analysis of the phase 3 trial. It also appears to be safe, with no serious adverse events in tens of thousands of subjects. They also did need to determine the proper dosing, including that an effective dose would require two administrations about 28 days apart. They had to confirm that the vaccine produced the desired antibodies, that those antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2, and then finally that in people it actually protected from the disease. This was all important work, and had to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was also done in record speed, because they were allowed to do research in parallel instead of waiting for the full analysis of one stage before progressing to the next. They also started to prep for production before approval, and were given an emergency use authorization. The same is true for Pfizer, although Pfizer and BioNTech funded their own research and development, while Moderna used investors and government grants. All of this was part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html&quot;&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the one thing that the Trump administration did right during this pandemic. But to give credit where it is properly due – this was not Trump’s idea or initiative. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/14/trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine/&quot;&gt;This idea came out of the FDA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April, Peter Marks, an oncologist who has worked in both academia and the drug industry and who heads the FDA division that regulates vaccines, began laying the groundwork for what would become Operation Warp Speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of having a vaccine ready by the end of the year was also made possible by 15 years of prior research and regulations. As some are reporting, it was an overnight success story 15 years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now, however, is can we do even better in the future? The idea is to develop a vaccine platform, and test that platform for safety and general efficacy. Then, when a new bug comes along, all you have to do is sequence its genome and then plug that information into the existing platform, and start cranking out vaccines. This literally could be done in a week. Since the platform itself is pre-tested, we won’t need to do months of testing before distribution. Still, we may need to do some testing on the specific vaccine. Perhaps much of this testing can be done with computer modeling, and some with animal testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that will be difficult to determine without extensive clinical trials if efficacy. Even there, we could make some reasonable predictions. We could, theoretically, roll out version 1.0 of the vaccine to the most needy, while tracking the results, and tweaking the formula if necessary. To borrow a saying widely used at the beginning of this pandemic – build the plane while flying it. But in this case, the plane is already 90% built with a known and tested configuration. In hindsight, if we had done this we could have essentially prevented most of the pandemic. The vaccine Moderna had in January turned out to be 95% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question ultimately comes down to risk vs benefit. We need to get over our evolved but suboptimal instinct to avoid directly causing harm preferentially over passively allowing harm to occur. In the end, the amount of harm is all that matters. In a situation like this, delivering a vaccine as quickly as possible while maintaining sufficient safety and efficacy, there is a sweet spot somewhere that minimizes disease, death, and disruption. We want that sweet spot, even it if means delivering a vaccine that has not been tested as much as we would like. It would mean accepting more risk form the vaccine in order to reduce risk from the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win-win here, however, is that the more we develop a universal vaccine platform, the more we can have the best of both worlds – fast plus safe and effective. But this also means we need public buy in, which requires reassuring the public about the process and the strategy. It also means reassuring the public that the process has not been politicized, and that objective experts are driving (something the TA did poorly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think carefully about all this, and perhaps evolve Operation Warp Speed into a sustainable vaccine-pandemic strategy. We know another pandemic is coming. We knew this one was coming. Experts were saying for decades that something very much like this was going to happen eventually (just listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcasts/episode-117&quot;&gt;this uncanny interview&lt;/a&gt; with infectious disease specialist Mark Crislip from 2007 on the SGU). It’s possible pandemics are going to be more frequent, with global travel, trade, and populations what they are. We need a strategy to deal with them while they are just starting. Choose your metaphor here – you don’t wait to build a fire department until after the fire is raging.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Have Resigned from the Google AMP Advisory Committee</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/12/i-have-resigned-from-the-google-amp-advisory-committee/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/12/i-have-resigned-from-the-google-amp-advisory-committee/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/WORKING_MODE.md#resignation&quot;&gt;AMP AC charter&lt;/a&gt;, I have resigned with immediate effect. As I was a non-corporate representative, I will not be nominating a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have loved working with the AC. They are a team of brilliant individuals who are all committed to trying to make AMP better, and I’m sorry to leave them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/09/snarking-on-the-internet/&quot;&gt;I’ve been a member of the AC for a little over two years&lt;/a&gt; and now is the time to step away and let a wider variety of people work on the committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a previous blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/11/new-years-resolution-start-an-msc/&quot;&gt;I am starting an MSc in January&lt;/a&gt; so I’m trying to cut back on my extracurricular activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated goal of the AMP AC is to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/WORKING_MODE.md#goal-of-the-ac&quot;&gt;make AMP a great web citizen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that – despite the hard work of the AC – Google has limited interest in that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined, I wondered whether I could make a difference. I hope that I have been a critical friend. The AC has encouraged AMP to think more about user needs – rather than Google’s needs. And changes to the search carousel were also a concern of the committee which have been partly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s thesis is that the mobile-web is dying and people prefer to use apps – therefore making the web faster and more app-like will retain users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/32&quot;&gt;Google don’t publish data about this&lt;/a&gt;, so I can’t directly criticise their motives. But I do not think AMP, in its current implementation, helps make the web better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that AMP is poorly implemented, hostile to the interests of both users and publishers, and a proprietary &amp;amp; unnecessary incursion into the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad that I tried to make it better, but I’m sad to have failed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Ampere Altra Review: 2x 80 Cores Arm Server Performance Monster</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we’re wrapping up 2020, one last large review item for the year is Ampere’s long promised new Altra Arm server processor. This year has indeed been the year where Arm servers have had a breakthrough; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13959/arm-announces-neoverse-n1-platform&quot;&gt;Arm’s new Neoverse-N1 CPU core&lt;/a&gt; had been the IP designer’s first true dedicated server core, promising focused performance and efficiency for the datacentre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year we had the chance to test out the first Neoverse-N1 silicon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd&quot;&gt;in the form of Amazon’s Graviton2&lt;/a&gt; inside of AWS EC2 cloud compute offering. The Graviton2 seemed like a very impressive design, but was rather conservative in its goals, and it’s also a piece of hardware that the general public cannot access outside of Amazon’s own cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ampere Computing, founded in 2017 by former Intel president Renée James, built upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/11978/macom-sells-off-appliedmicros-xgene-cpu-business&quot;&gt;initial IP and design talent of AppliedMicro’s X-Gene CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14212/ampere-computing-arm-is-an-investor&quot;&gt;Arm Holdings becoming an investor in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, is at this moment in time the sole “true” merchant silicon vendor designing and offering up Neoverse-N1 server designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the company has had a few products out in the form of the eMAG chips, but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15733/ampere-emag-system-a-32core-arm64-workstation&quot;&gt;rather disappointing performance figures&lt;/a&gt; - understandable given that those were essentially legacy products based on the old X-Gene microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15575/amperes-altra-80-core-n1-soc-for-hyperscalers-against-rome-and-xeon&quot;&gt;Ampere’s new Altra product line&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand is the culmination of several years of work and close collaboration with Arm – and the company first “true” product which can be viewed as Ampere pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, with hardware in hand, we’re finally taking a look at the very first publicly available high-performance Neoverse based Arm server hardware, designed for nothing less than maximum achievable performance, aiming to battle the best designs from Intel and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mount Jade Server with Altra Quicksilver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ampere has supplied us with the company’s server reference design, dubbed “Mount Jade”, a 2-socket 2U rack unit sever. The server came supplied with two Altra Q80-33 processors, Ampere’s top-of-the-line SKU with each featuring 80 cores running at up to 3.3GHz, with TDP reaching up to 250W per socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3724.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3724_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3733.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3733_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server was designed with close collaboration with Wiwynn for this dual socket, and with GIGABYTE for the single socket variant, as previously hinted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15949/ampere-altra-1p-server-pictured-gigabytes-2u-with-80-arm-n1-cores-pcie-40-and-ccix&quot;&gt;the two company’s announcements of leading hyperscale deployments of the Altra platforms.&lt;/a&gt; The Ampere-branded Mount Jade DVT reference motherboard comes in a typical server blue colour scheme and features 2 sockets with up to 16 DIMM slots per socket, reaching up to 4TB DRAM capacity per socket, although our review unit came equipped with 256GB per socket across 8 DIMMs to fully populate the chip’s 8-channel memory controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3748.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3748_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3761.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3761_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also our first look at Ampere’s first-generation socket design. The company doesn’t really market any particular name to the socket, but it’s a massive LGA4926 socket with a pin-count in excess of any other commercial server socket from AMD or Intel. The holding mechanism is somewhat similar to that of AMD’s SP3 system, with a holding mechanism tensioned by a 5-point screw system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3755.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3755_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chip itself is absolutely humongous and amongst the current publicly available processors is the biggest in the industry, out-sizing AMD’s SP3 form-factor packaging, coming in at around 77 x 66.8mm – about the same length but considerably wider than AMD’s counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3758.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3758_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3739.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3739_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s a massive chip with a huge IHS, the Mount Jade server surprised me with its cooling solution as the included 250W type cooler only made contact with about 1/4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; the surface area of the heat spreader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ampere here doesn’t have a recessed “lip” around the IHS for the mounting bracket to hold onto the chip like on AMD or Intel systems, so the actual IHS surface is actually recessed in relation to the bracket which means you cannot have a flat surface cooler design across the whole of the chip surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3764.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3764_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the included 250W design cooler uses a huge vapour chamber design with a “pedestal” to make contact with the chip. Ampere explains that they’ve experimented with different designs and found that a smaller area pedestal actually worked better for heat dissipation – siphoning heat off from the actual chip die which is notably smaller than the IHS and chip package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3744.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3744_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cooler design is quite complex, with vertical fin stacks dissipating heat directly off the vapour chamber, with additional large horizontal fins dissipating heat from 6 U-shaped heat pipes that draw heat from the vapour chamber. It’s definitely a more complex and high-end design than what we’re used to in server coolers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Mount Jade server is definitely a very interesting piece of hardware, our focus today lies around the actual new Altra processors themselves, so let’s dive into the new Q80-33 80-core chip next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is also published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/big-tech/facebook-criticising-apples-ios-14-privacy-changes-is-a-hypocrisy-231560dda56c?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=c9fd038aaf5162a9aaf347d522b75c29&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During WWDC 2020, Apple had announced a new iOS 14 privacy-based feature that sent chills down the spine of advertisement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there’s a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppTrackingTransparency&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework introduced with iOS 14 which renders the unique advertising identifier useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means advertisement agencies can no longer track users across apps and websites without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, over 100K apps on the App Store use the Facebook SDK to track user activity, run campaigns, record ad clicks, usage time, and subsequently serve personalized advertisements. Understandably Facebook pays them a huge share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with iOS 14 advertisement agencies are about to stare at diminished returns since they would no longer be able to track a single user as effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to an outcry by Facebook a few months back. They called it a foul play. Given the times we’re in and the fact that this is a major change, Apple obliged and gave developers and marketers more time to get ready for the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the deadline to ship apps with the new privacy-focused &lt;code&gt;SKAdNetwork&lt;/code&gt; framework only a month away, Facebook is trying to sabotage it by running campaigns to pressurize Apple into postponing the new iOS 14 privacy feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only recently, Facebook doubled down on its marketing campaign against Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media giant rolled out full-page ads across popular publishing houses such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the headline of the ad states: “We’re standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Facebook, “over 40 percent of small to medium businesses are using personalized ads today”. And the new iOS 14 privacy features threaten to kill those businesses by causing a revenue drop of as much as 60 percent per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For noobs and non-techies, it may seem as Facebook is the savior since Apple is being projected as the antagonist here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the marketing stunt is only one side of the story. There’s a lot more than what meets the eye and Facebook is clearly omitting the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, it’s worth knowing that Apple isn’t blocking Facebook from targeting users for personalized ads. Instead, they’re only giving the user an option — whether or not they want to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Facebook perceives this feature as Apple’s way of killing their billion-dollar ad empire as it spreads awareness about data privacy amongst users. This is why Facebook is crying foul play and attacking Apple since the WWDC 2020 event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has been accusing Apple of playing double standards with privacy. The social media giant claims that the iPhone maker is leveraging privacy for their own profitability and to keep a hold over its App Store monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the manner in which Facebook is projecting their anti-Apple campaign through the “they will hurt small businesses” slogan is terribly, laughably wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling their move cynical won’t be an overstatement since it’s pretty clear that Facebook isn’t worried about small businesses. Instead, they’re concerned that they won’t be able to mint as much money since from those advertisement agencies that now might begin looking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most bewildering thing is that a company that’s widely using shady business tactics, makes profits off user data, and is long known for its “copy, buy or kill” strategy against booming startups is actually hoping to rile up everyone against Apple, a consumer-focused trillion-dollar firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because Facebook could get away with app privacy measures a decade back and managed to build an ad-empire out of abusing free data, doesn’t mean that they can continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacking Apple through such campaigns only shows how less Facebook actually cares about user’s privacy. In fact, it clearly portrays that Facebook is only interested in retaining and monetizing off the user’s personal data to preserve their monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes Facebook's move to evoke compassion for small businesses a shrewd way to protect their own best interests — which is indeed a quintessential case of hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Facebook has launched this campaign at a time when they find themselves already embroiled in the biggest antitrust lawsuit of the decade. The timing of this factless marketing move couldn’t have been poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway from this feud is that Google has surprisingly stayed silent all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a no brainer that the search engine giant will be compelled to bring a similar anti-ad tracking feature on Android to keep the mobile ecosystem in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes Facebook’s whole fight against Apple a losing cause already. As the two leading mobile operating systems will continue to double down on data transparency, Facebook’s access to user data would be curtailed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won’t be dramatic to state that Apple’s new opt-in popup permission dialog will cripple Facebook’s advertisement business and push them into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this one. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
