<title>W3C and the WHATWG sign agreement to collaborate on single version of HTML, DOM</title>
<link>https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;imageLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/05/w3c-whatwg-logos.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/05/w3c-whatwg-logos-150px.png&quot; alt=&quot;logos of W3C and WHATWG&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today W3C and the WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html&quot;&gt;Memorandum of Understanding jointly published as the WHATWG/W3C Joint Working Mode&lt;/a&gt; gives the specifics of this collaboration. This is the culmination of a careful exploration of effective partnership mechanisms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/whatwg-working-mode-changes/&quot;&gt;since December 2017&lt;/a&gt; after the WHATWG adopted many shared features as their work-mode and an IPR policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML Working Group which we will &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Apr/0004.html&quot;&gt;soon recharter&lt;/a&gt; will assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and bring WHATWG Review Drafts to Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the belief that having two distinct HTML and DOM specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the community, and the mutual desire to bring the work back together, W3C and WHATWG agree to the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;show_items&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;W3C and WHATWG work together on HTML and DOM, in the WHATWG repositories, to produce a Living Standard and Recommendation/Review Draft-snapshots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WHATWG maintains the HTML and DOM Living Standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C facilitates community work directly in the WHATWG repositories (bridging communities, developing use cases, filing issues, writing tests, mediating issue resolution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C stops independent publishing of a designated list of specifications related to HTML and DOM and instead will work to take WHATWG Review Drafts to W3C Recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;W3C remains committed to ensuring that HTML development continues to take into account the needs of the global community, and continues to improve in areas such as accessibility, internationalization and privacy while providing greater interoperability, performance and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may read in W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe’s blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/05/w3c-and-whatwg-to-work-together-to-advance-the-open-web-platform/&quot;&gt;W3C and WHATWG to work together to advance the open Web platform&lt;/a&gt; further contextual information and additional aspects of the collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I can see your local web servers</title>
<link>http://http.jameshfisher.com/2019/05/26/i-can-see-your-local-web-servers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://http.jameshfisher.com/2019/05/26/i-can-see-your-local-web-servers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;How many web servers are running on your machine right now? Do all of those development web servers have a secure login, and restrictive CORS permissions? You don’t know? Allow me to check for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any results like &lt;span class=&quot;result bad&quot;&gt;localhost:3000 is available!&lt;/span&gt;, you should secure whatever you have running on that port, because all websites you visit have access to it - including the page you’re reading! It is not sufficient security to only bind to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; (the “loopback interface”), because there are untrusted programs running on your machine right now that have access to the loopback interface. Those untrusted programs are web pages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake is easily made. Here’s an example vulnerable app, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt;, a popular web framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'express'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'cors'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'My personal admin site'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, many servers bind to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the server is available from anywhere that can reach the machine. For example, Express does this by default! If you’re at work right now, you might have dozens of other employees on your local network. We can scan for all of their exposed servers, too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any results like &lt;span class=&quot;result bad&quot;&gt;192.168.0.4:3000 is available!&lt;/span&gt;, you should tell your colleague to secure whatever she has running on that port, because it is accessible by all websites visited by all your colleagues! It is not sufficient security to hide behind a NAT (e.g. your WiFi router), because there are untrusted programs running on your network right now that have access to every machine - again, those untrusted programs are web pages!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The realities of &amp;#039;owning&amp;#039; a Japanese convenience store</title>
<link>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/05/27/national/behind-scenes-24-7-service-realities-owning-japanese-convenience-store/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/05/27/national/behind-scenes-24-7-service-realities-owning-japanese-convenience-store/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A familiar orange and green signboard glares in the pitch-dark, quiet street in a residential area. There, the owner of a 7-Eleven franchise store located in the suburbs of a small city in the Chubu region works the night shift every day by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner, in his 40s, said he works 500 hours a month. He consulted with the Labor Standards Inspection Office, only to be told that it doesn’t deal with complaints from owners.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When his wife works with him, the couple keep their 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter in a room at the back of the store and let them play games or watch videos using a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floor has stains made by the children eating chocolates. When the daughter caught the flu, they placed a couple of chairs side by side for her to lie down on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is almost like abuse,” the owner said, looking at a family picture from when they took a trip to a theme park in the Kanto region. “We need more time to spend with our children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things went well for him at first after he opened the store in 2012. There were about 20 employees — double the current number — and he had to work night shifts only once a week. But in the fall of 2016, a FamilyMart store opened nearby, followed by another 7-Eleven outlet not far away from his store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensified competition among the stores led to plummeting sales and hiring part-timers became almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Monday night in late March, only 10 customers came to the man’s store in the three hours before dawn, and the sales during that time were a little more than ¥6,000. The store will be in the red if he hired someone for night shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenience store chain operators stress their stores’ role as being part of the social infrastructure, including the prevention of nighttime crime and supplying goods in the event of disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the man, who has recently been suffering often from high fever, asked: “Does (being part of the) social infrastructure mean shortening my life to keep the store open all the time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franchise owners’ struggles are reflected in the statistics as well. Seven-Eleven Japan Co. increased its outlets by some 1,000 every year between the 2011 and 2017 business years. During the same period, the labor shortage became more severe: The ratio of job-offers-to-job-seekers rose from 0.56 to 1.54, and the weighted national average minimum wage rose from ¥730 to ¥848.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobuo Kawabe, a professor emeritus of management history at Waseda University who is well-versed in issues related to the convenience store business, pointed out that the background of franchise owners have changed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kawabe, many owners of newly opened stores are former company employees, lacking management knowledge, assets or experience. Traditionally, many franchise owners were self-employed store operators who switched their business to a convenience store, possessing the shares of the chain operator and the land where their stores are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who quit companies (to become franchise owners) are complaining that they are not making money although they were told that the business would be profitable,” Kawabe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-Eleven Japan “has forgotten the philosophy of coexistence and coprosperity with franchise stores and failed to listen to their voices,” he said, calling on the chain operator to either make up for the labor shortage or revise the stores’ business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first 7-Eleven store in Japan opened in Tokyo’s Toyosu district in 1974, convenience stores became a great hit, functioning virtually as a fridge for young people and single households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one mom-and-pop store after another turned into convenience stores, the number topped 10,000 in fiscal 1988 and 30,000 in fiscal 1996, according to the Japan Franchise Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the turn of the century, however, the growth in the number of convenience stores slowed down, with many saying the market is saturated. Convenience store chains sought to expand their services by accepting over-the-counter bill payments and parcels for delivery, introducing ATMs and signing agreements with local governments for cooperation in times of disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kawabe said the revival of convenience stores came with the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. “People in disaster-hit areas felt relieved to see the stores open even after the disaster,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s convenience stores are welcomed by all generations including the elderly, and their operators, especially Seven-Eleven Japan, started opening new stores again. Many regarded this as a sign that the views on market saturation had been proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many franchise store owners are struggling under the overwhelming dominance of the parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, when Fukui Prefecture was hit by the heaviest snowfall in decades, it was discovered that a 7-Eleven franchise store was banned by the parent company from closing temporarily even after the store owner’s wife fell ill from overwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, convenience stores’ around-the-clock service was brought into the spotlight again when a 7-Eleven franchise store in Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, cut its operating hours without permission from the parent company, which the chain operator disapproved of. Following criticisms, Seven-Eleven Japan said it will review its 24-hour operating policy and began experimenting with reduced-hour operations at some of its directly managed stores and franchise stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Trade Commission, meanwhile, is exploring the possibility of applying the antitrust law, which prohibits companies from abusing their positions of power, to convenience store chain operators forcing their franchisees to operate around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko’s request, on April 25 convenience store chain operators released action plans on managing and supporting franchisees. Seven-Eleven Japan’s plan included measures to expand support to franchise stores and introduce stricter rules for opening new stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will let the owners (of franchise stores) make the final decision (on whether to shorten operating hours),” said Seven-Eleven Japan President Fumihiko Nagamatsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitoshi Matsumoto, 57, the owner of the Higashiosaka store, said he decided to cut business hours as a last resort. He lost his wife in May last year and he “was on the verge of falling ill or dying from &lt;em&gt;karōshi&lt;/em&gt; (death from overwork),” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto had expected the store’s sales and net income would drop, but as a matter of fact his net income rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fresco&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/n-chubu-b-20190528.jpg&quot; data-fresco-group=&quot;inline-images&quot; data-fresco-group-options=&quot;ui:'inside'&quot; data-fresco-caption=&quot;Mitoshi Matsumoto speaks in front of his 7-Eleven store in Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, which has a sign at the entrance saying the store’s operating hours have been reduced since February. | CHUNICHI SHIMBUN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/n-chubu-b-20190528.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mitoshi Matsumoto speaks in front of his 7-Eleven store in Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, which has a sign at the entrance saying the store’s operating hours have been reduced since February. | CHUNICHI SHIMBUN&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mitoshi Matsumoto speaks in front of his 7-Eleven store in Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, which has a sign at the entrance saying the store’s operating hours have been reduced since February. | CHUNICHI SHIMBUN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the store’s profit and loss statement, the average daily sales in February last year — when the store was operating 24 hours — were ¥570,000 and the total monthly sales were about ¥16 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February this year, after the store started operating from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., monthly sales dropped to around ¥15 million and the royalty fee paid to the chain operator based on gross profit also declined. But his net income increased by ¥400,000 compared with February last year because the labor cost — the cost that franchisees have to bear — was reduced significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second largest expense that franchisees bear after labor cost is the cost to dispose of food that has expired, because Seven-Eleven Japan’s system effectively makes franchisees purchase all expired food items such as rice balls and bento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late February, Matsumoto began discounting foods nearing expiration and his net income in March rose by about ¥100,000 from the previous month. He said he used to think that food disposal leads to more profit, as he was told by the chain operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Seven-Eleven Japan says franchisees and the chain operator “have an equal relationship,” Matsumoto says the relationship is “that of ants and an elephant,” citing a large gap in power and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The system works in a way that the more exhausted franchisees get, the more profitable the chain operator becomes. I had been fooled,” Matsumoto said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast, Sapporo-based Secoma Co., which runs the convenience store chain Seicomart with 1,189 stores mainly in Hokkaido, has succeeded in establishing an equal relationship with its franchisees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seicomart has been chosen as the most satisfying convenience store chain in the Japan Productivity Center’s Japan Customer Satisfaction Index for three years in a row since fiscal 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fresco&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/n-chubu-c-20190528.jpg&quot; data-fresco-group=&quot;inline-images&quot; data-fresco-group-options=&quot;ui:'inside'&quot; data-fresco-caption=&quot;A Seicomart store in Sapporo says its operating hours are from 6 a.m. until midnight. Nearly 80 percent of Seicomart stores do not open 24 hours a day. | CHUNICHI SHIMBUN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/n-chubu-c-20190528.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Seicomart store in Sapporo says its operating hours are from 6 a.m. until midnight.

Nearly 80 percent of Seicomart stores do not open 24 hours a day. | CHUNICHI SHIMBUN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which started its business as a sake dealer with a management philosophy of supporting liquor stores, gives franchisees control over their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores’ business hours are basically between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. They extend the hours based on their own decisions, with only 23 percent choosing to operate around-the-clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy that I don’t get calls late at night,” said a 45-year-old woman who runs a Seicomart store near Sapporo University which is open from 6 a.m. until midnight. The woman, who used to work at a 24-hour store, said she now has more time to spend with her child as she is able to come home by 9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also offers territory rights to its franchisees so that new stores will not be set up close to the existing ones, protecting them from having to take customers and workers from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secoma sets its franchise royalty fee at 10 percent of gross profit — which is low compared with other convenience store operators — and makes profits by selling to franchisees products manufactured by its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-Eleven Japan, on the other hand, adopts what is called the “area-dominant strategy,” intensively recruiting franchisees within limited areas, and asks for 40 to 75 percent of gross profit as a franchise fee — the highest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The area-dominant strategy results in expansion of the chain’s overall market share, thus helping its stores increase their sales significantly,” an executive of Seven &amp;amp; I Holdings Co., a holding company of Seven-Eleven Japan, said. “In exchange (for the high franchise fee), the chain operator provides management advice and other support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the firm’s area-dominant strategy and moves to discourage discount sales by threatening to cancel franchise contracts, some 7-Eleven store owners created a labor union for convenience store franchisees in 2009. But the union has so far failed to negotiate with the company, and the Central Labor Relations Commission in March dismissed the union’s plea to gain the right to collective bargaining, admitting the company’s claim that franchisees are independent business owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secoma President Tomoyasu Marutani said that major convenience store chain operators “are exploiting franchisees by signing unique contracts, using the freedom of contract as an excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to realize sustainable management, franchisees need to make a profit,” Marutani said. “Even if they manage to cope with the issue of 24-hour operation, they will soon face another problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-type=&quot;sourceText&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;It's a feeling of extreme work stress that's long been embedded in the cultural lexicon, and now it might be codified in your medical records as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body-text_BodyText__UjdHO _9db439e9 speakable&quot; readability=&quot;30.93023255814&quot;&gt;Burnout is now a legitimate medical diagnosis, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/129180281&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Classification of Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, or the ICD-11, the World Health Organization's handbook that guides medical providers in diagnosing diseases.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout now appears in the ICD-11's section on problems related to employment or unemployment. According to the handbook, doctors can diagnose someone with burnout if they meet the following symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I Learned Trying to Secure Congressional Campaigns</title>
<link>https://idlewords.com/2019/05/what_i_learned_trying_to_secure_congressional_campaigns.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://idlewords.com/2019/05/what_i_learned_trying_to_secure_congressional_campaigns.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;05.27.&lt;a class=&quot;date&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2019/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;post_title&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2019/05/what_i_learned_trying_to_secure_congressional_campaigns.htm&quot;&gt;What I Learned Trying To Secure Congressional Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://idlewords.com/images/yubikey_trays.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how it happens. You try to secure one Congressional campaign, and then another, and pretty soon you can't stop. You'll fly across the country just to brief a Green Party candidate in a district the Republicans carried by 60 points. You want more, more, always looking for that next fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the situation I found myself in from late 2017 to 2018, when I was part of an effort that delivered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techsolidarity.org/resources/congressional_howto.html&quot;&gt;basic, hour-long campaign security training&lt;/a&gt; to 41 Democratic Congressional campaigns. It was exciting! I traveled the country like Johnny Yubikey, distributing little blue security tokens from a sack. The campaigns ranged from beyond-long-shot candidates running from their den, all the way up to some nationally prominent figures. I took a selfie with Bernie! I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/04/im-teaching-email-security-democratic-campaigns-its-bad/?utm_term=.2f0c54acfeda&quot;&gt;opinion piece in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe I accomplished much, but I made so many friends along the way! And I learned a lot about the idiosyncratic world of Congressional campaigns; knowledge that I want to now hand over to you, the next person willing to take a swing at this piñata of futility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is specificaly about &lt;em&gt;campaign security&lt;/em&gt;, or how to keep candidates and their staff and families safe from people trying to break into social media, read their email, or wire their campaign war chest to Nauru. There are a lot of even more hopeless problems, like election security, but as you will see there is plenty to lose hope about just in this corner of the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A note to the well, actually crowd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I talk about training campaigns, it devolves into an argument over technology. I fear that by fixating on the technical content of the briefings, we are missing an opportunity for a much richer, more satisfying nerdfight about process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two foundational questions in campaign security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you say to a campaign if you get an hour of their attention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you get an hour of their attention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of these is the hard part. Like Mike Tyson says, “everybody has a plan until you punch them in the face.” Everyone has a security checklist for campaigns until they try to schedule a meeting. So my plea is, let's not forget to argue about the interesting problem of how to get to campaigns, in addition to whether I'm history's greatest monster for telling people not to use Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A note to idealists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical campaign security is a wood chipper for your hopes and dreams. It sits at the intersection of 19 kinds of status quo, each more odious than the last. You have to accept the fact that computers are broken, software is terrible, campaign finance is evil, the political parties are inept, the DCCC exists, politics is full of parasites, tech companies are run by arrogant man-children, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the urge to fix these broken systems long enough to help people get work done is the great unsolved problem of campaign security. You will start out a descriptivist and end up a zealot, like I did. Trying to secure a modern campaign is like doing surgery with a scalpel made out of anthrax spores. At some point you will throw down the anthrax scalpel and say &quot;this is impossible!&quot;, as it disappears in a puff of lethal dust. But the patient still needs you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will focus here on Democratic campaigns for Congress, because that is the world I know. If you know the Republican side of this, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:maciej@ceglowski.com&quot;&gt;tell me stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How a Congressional campaign works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a first approximation, a House campaign is an 18-month fundraising marathon with lawn signs. Over its lifetime it will raise and spend something like two million dollars, and at its peak employ two dozen staffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of that period, you are dealing with a couple of people trapped in a living hell called call time. Theresa Gasper, who ran for Congress in Ohio's 10th district, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@gaspertheresa/the-campaign-industrial-complex-da0cc1763494&quot;&gt;describes it well here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is call time? Torture. You sit in an office for 4–6 hours(ideally) with a 20-something next to you dialing the phone and handing you a call sheet with info on the person you’re calling to beg for money. […] You have an “ASK” — the amount of money to specifically ask them for, and then you are strongly encouraged to get a credit card number over the phone and complete the transaction before hanging up. If not, it becomes a ‘pledge’ and if it doesn’t come in within two weeks, you’re back on the phone “pledge chasing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you’ll be on the phone 30 hours a week, you’ll make 40 calls per hour and connect with about 30% of them. Your call time manager will track the amount of time scheduled, the time you took for any breaks, the actual call time completed, number of calls made, number completed and the results — all of which will be submitted to the DCCC, EMILY’s List or any other group who has “adopted” your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This soul-crushing telethon is the principal activity of a Congressional campaign. Getting in its way is like getting between a mama bear and her cub. You are just going to find yourself clawed to death by a frantic finance director. Whatever you do to secure a campaign &lt;strong&gt;must not be an obstacle to fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two elections that matter to a Congressional campaign. The first is a primary, which in most districts is in May or June. The second is the general election in November. A few weeks before each election, the campaign staffs up, and you have people like field directors and volunteer coordinators come in, in addition to the many volunteers themselves. This is a time when a lot of training is done, and if you are lucky, you can insinuate yourself into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the primary, it's typical for senior staff to reshuffle across campaigns, and the fundraising slog begins afresh. The fundraising calendar is built around quarterly FEC filing deadlines (March, June, September, December), and as every campaign sees the lion's share of donations come in during the last week of fundraising, that is the absolute worst time to try to reach anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technology point of view, all a House campaign needs is a spreadsheet and a phone. There is no IT staff, a minimal consulting budget, and no special campaign infrastructure. The bigger campaigns may have a staffer set up G Suite or Microsoft Exchange, or farm the task out to a consultancy, while the smaller ones will just work off of personal devices and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest piece of technology in the campaign is something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGP_VAN&quot;&gt;Voter Activation Network&lt;/a&gt; (NGP VAN), a database of registered voters used extensively by field organizers for operations like phone banking and door-to-door canvassing. Campaigns get access to VAN through their state party. VAN is its own universe and outside the scope of this guide, but the person who is in charge of it is often the most tech-savvy person on the campaign, and you should make an effort to talk to them. (A good icebreaker with these people is talking about how much you both hate VAN.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the threat?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two big areas of sensitive information around a political campaign. Let's call them 'Bucket A' and 'Bucket B'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bucket A&lt;/strong&gt; is the stuff that is campaign-specific and needs to be kept confidential. This includes fundraising numbers and mailing lists, campaign memos on issue positions, research on opponents, strategy documents, media buys, correspondence with the national party, unflattering photos of the candidate and so on. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belfercenter.org/CyberPlaybook&quot;&gt;training materials&lt;/a&gt; the Democratic Party provides to campaigns are meant to keep this stuff safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bucket B&lt;/strong&gt; is what lives in people's personal accounts. This includes every email they've written, their social media history, complete access (via password reset) to all the online services they've signed up for, their chat history, creepy DMs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/10/10/anthony-weiner-jailed-sexting-girl-15-get-early-release/1587360002/&quot;&gt;sexts to minors&lt;/a&gt;, plus all the stuff they've forwarded to their personal accounts from the campaign account, the Dropbox folder they keep their passwords in, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an attacker, I would be drawn to bucket B. There is nothing interesting in a campaign's financials or strategy. The strategy is always ‘talk about health care’, and the financials have to be disclosed every quarter by law. Everything juicy lives in the personal accounts, and moving laterally between those accounts will eventually give you access to bucket A anyway, because people are terrible at keeping this stuff separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Bucket B means you can also target more people, like the candidate's spouse and family, who the people defending Bucket A consider out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our training, we worked off the assumption that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails&quot;&gt;Podesta hacks&lt;/a&gt; were a template for what might happen to campaigns, and that securing campain-adjacent personal accounts was more important than worrying about campaign data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no law that says this is how every bad actor has to attack campaigns. But you have to pick a threat, and we picked this one! I believe we were the only group in 2018 with an exclusive focus on securing personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you get a meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;
A campaign is a high-stress environment. There is no good time to approach them, but many bad times (usually right before a quarterly FEC filing deadline). My main advice in reaching out to campaings is to &lt;strong&gt;be succinct&lt;/strong&gt;, make a specific request, and have someone who can vouch for you.
&lt;p&gt;Offering security training is like being a dentist offering a teeth cleaning. Everyone understands in the abstract that this is something they need. They feel guilty about putting it off. Maybe if you are really persuasive and can talk in scary terms about gum disease, they will agree to do it. But they will not enjoy it, and however much they promise, they are never going to floss. (Also in this analogy the dentist isn't a real dentist, but some guy who runs a bedbug website.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should understand that there are a zillion people and groups out there who want to do tech experiments on campaigns, and without someone to vouch for you, you will make no headway. You will fare especially badly if you have written an app to fix politics. Put the app away and never speak of it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're coming in cold, I suggest you volunteer for an established group like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digidems.com/&quot;&gt;DigiDems&lt;/a&gt;, a local campaign, or your local or state party office. Don't go in with guns blazing about security. Do something helpful related to IT so that you begin to meet people. Tech people who get stuff done are a rare and valuable commodity on any campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where everyone needs help is figuring out how to do digital advertising, so if you help people there, you will soon be in a position where many people have warm feelings about you and you can start to ask for introductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign security training works just like account hacking: you get better results by starting at the edges and working your way in. Spending time on a campaign will also teach you a lot about your audience, and why the solution you thought you had to the problem won't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you tell people to do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if getting campaigns to meet with you wasn't hard enough, there's also the problem of what to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limiting reagent here is people's mental capacity for hassle. You have to take pains not to burn through it. It is possible, with whining, to get a campaign to do one or two things. If you catch them early enough, and can visit them multiple times, maybe they will do a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of back-and-forth with friends in the security community to figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://techsolidarity.org/resources/congressional_howto.html&quot;&gt;what information we could convey in an hour&lt;/a&gt;, and how to prioritize it. We finally came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collect information about what devices people are using, their email provider, whether they have two-factor authentication, how they share documents in the campaign, how they keep track of passwords, and so on. Explain that you are not a Russian spy. Make them do all their overdue software updates in front of you while you start part 2 (10 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce U2F security keys and explain how they prevent the kind of attack that ensnared John Podesta. Demonstrate how to use them and what to do if you lose them. Have everyone open their laptop and walk them thorugh the setup, then demo a trial login, with the key and with a backup method. (30 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about email and attachments. This part is almost like sex education: you preach abstinence, but you know the moment you leave the room, they'll be double-clicking on whatever Excel spreadsheet the DCCC forwarded them that day. Explain high-risk behaviors, low-risk behaviors, and how to open stuff more safely in GDrive. Try to push the campaign towards shared Google Docs and Signal instead of email. (20 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If additional time is available, talk about devices and password habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the best days, I was able to sit down with the whole campaign staff, who had brought their laptops. One or more people had heard of security keys, the candidate already used a password manager, and there was enough time for questions at the end. There was a fresh box of donuts on the table, right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the worst day, I flew to meet with a campaign manager who truncated our appointment to ten minutes and skimmed through emails as I was talking, and then I got on a plane and flew away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I learned doing the training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As far as hardware goes, campaigns are in pretty good shape! Macs, iPhones and chromebooks are in widespread use. Chromebooks are popular with field organizers because they're cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few people are aware that there is a big jump in safety between using a laptop and using a phone/iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people use Gmail for their personal email, and a significant number have it set up with SMS as the second factor (that is, they get a numeric code texted to them when signing in). Most people also have multiple Gmail accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are often easy technical problems you can solve that build goodwill. For example, we found out that NGP VAN and Facebook use different data formats, so people around the country were spending time massaging CSV files in order to create Facebook campaigns. A friend wrote a script that did this conversion automatically when you dragged things to a desktop folder, and I would mention this during campaign visits. Suddenly I was no longer the dentist, but Santa Claus come early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The odds are good that at least one person in the room has used a TOTP app (like Google Authenticator) and has it installed on their phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the most productive people on a campaign are volunteers with unfixable bad technology habits. There seems to be a relationship between orneriness and output. It's important to give campaign people strategies for reducing the volunteer's technological blast radius while still allowing them to get work done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a certain breed of young person who I came to think of as campaign ronin. They are political junkies in their twenties and thirties who wander between campaigns, or back and forth into the world of political consulting. Their mobile nature (and tendency to gossip) makes these restless souls a good vector for security practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google's &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/&quot;&gt;Advanced Protection Program&lt;/a&gt; is almost comically unusable for campaigns. The expensive dongles break easily, and when the dongle breaks you are locked out of your fundraising spreadsheets until you can reach Google support (if such a thing exists). This breaks the cardinal rule of never getting between a campaign and fundraising. I will leave you to guess whether Google ever field-tested APP on a live campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing that happens when setting people up U2F keys is that 20 identical keys get mixed up. Bring sharpies or colored tape with you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A useful way to set up a backup U2F key for all staff is to clip it to a hula hoop that hangs the campaign manager's office. This is goofy but effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any training that involves email should budget time for people to go through password recovery, because someone will inevitably forget their password. Also some handy advice to phishers: people who can't remember their Gmail password will sequentially try all of their passwords until one works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody acts on the DNC/Belfer Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belfercenter.org/CyberPlaybook&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Campaign Playboook&lt;/a&gt; recommendations, because they are too vague. I found it best to treat the Belfer document as a revered holy text that required exegesis to be understood by the faithful. Like any good priest, I ignored 90% of what it said and put my own spin on the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People had a fairly good sense of what phishing was, and why it posed a threat. They were pleasantly surprised to learn that susceptibility to phishing had nothing to do with tech savvy. In the campaign context, it's important to remember that staff will also be targeted by phone, and that campaign funds may be a more attractive target than data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most candidates and staff I met had gone through and scrubbed their Facebook accounts early in the campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few people use Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Things that worked well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing this in person&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't believe any training in this space can be effective unless actual human beings go out and do the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving people one way to do things&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of the training materials in this space make a distinction between regular communication and &quot;sensitive data&quot;. I found it easiest to tell people to do everything the secure way. This reduces the cognitive overhead of having to evaluate what is sensitive, and eliminates an entire class of mistakes. So for example, rather than treating Signal as a higher-security version of email, I urged campaigns to move all their conversations there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommending specific products&lt;/strong&gt;. We told people to use Signal, iPhones/iPads, Google docs, and to buy the blue Yubikey. If any of that posed a problem, we found other products to recommend. The goal was not to score those sweet affilliate sales, but to remove decision points and cognitive overhead by standardizing on a known good set of products. There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/08/13/securitykeys.html&quot;&gt;hundred FIDO keys you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, but only one blue Yubikey, and that is the point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about degrees of safety&lt;/strong&gt;, and giving people an incremental path to secure behavior. For example, we told campaigns it was best to have a password manager, okay to have a written list of random passwords, dangerous to have a password pattern you would modify across sites, and unacceptable to re-use a single password across sites . That way people could improve their security incrementally until they got to the recommended configuration, even if they couldn't get all the way there in one step. I preferred that they use their cat's birthday as their Google password and their dog's birthday for Facebook, rather than the dog's birthday for both. We live in a fallen world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shame reduction&lt;/strong&gt;. I tried to emphasize to people that there was an entire security community rooting for them, and that it shouldn't be their job to have to get all these broken technologies right. I learned if you refrain from shaming people, they will eventually confess some horrific sins, and snitch on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spreading the impact over time&lt;/strong&gt;. I encouraged campaigns to pick one thing a week and do it. For example, in week 1 they might all move from SMS to Signal, and get used to that. In week 2 they could make sure they were set up with security keys. In week 3, switch from attachments to sharing Google docs. This made follow-up conversations less confrontational. Campaigns could talk about what they had done, rather than feeling like they had fallen short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving people a contact number&lt;/strong&gt;. I handed out my phone number to everybody, and told campaigns to pester me with questions, however trivial. I was always delighted to hear from a campaign, because it meant that they were trying to follow some of the security advice. If they asked me their question over Signal, it felt like Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using public health analogies&lt;/strong&gt;. It was tricky at first to figure out how to convince people the threat was real without scaring them into apathy. The analogy to public health did the job. I told people they were getting the 'wash your hands, boil your water' version of security advice, which communicated several ideas: that the guidelines were practical, that they made people safer, and that they weren't targeted at &quot;tech&quot; people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Things that went badly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;29.765476442003&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password managers&lt;/strong&gt;. I was never able to find a way to set people up on a password manager in the time available. Let me be very clear: I would like all people to use a password manager. Every night, I dream of a world where people use password managers.
&lt;p&gt;But I never found a way to get people onto 1password in a single training session. The setup process has a lot of moving parts, involving the desktop app, browser plugin, online service, mobile app, and app store. It requires repeatedly typing a long master passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, once it is all set up, you have to train people on the unrelated skill of how to use the thing, starting with their most sensitive accounts. And then you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I told candidates to generate unique passwords and save them in the notes app on their phone, or write them down on a card they kept in their wallet. And I'd do it again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11.78231292517&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempts to work with the DNC and DCCC&lt;/strong&gt;. The national party was so unhelpful that in the end I had to treat them as part of the threat model. Particularly vexing was their addiction to sending email attachments.
&lt;p&gt;To cite one small example: on August 22, the DNC had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/23/dnc-cyberattack-scare-phishing-test/&quot;&gt;a phishing scare&lt;/a&gt;, where they mistook a vulnerability assessment for an actual attack. The next day, DCCC Executive Director Dan Sena sent an email to all campaings with the subject line &quot;Reminder About Cybersecurity&quot;. That email included three attachments, including a file evocatively titled &quot;2—20170712—Falcon.docx&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a more efficient way to compromise every campaign in the country than blasting security alerts with dodgy attachments from the DCCC email account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DCCC sent out attachments constantly. It drove me nuts. And I was never able to get a meeting with anyone there to slug it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;15.582608695652&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uneven U2F support&lt;/strong&gt;. Security keys are still hard to use. The biggest problem is the lack of support for U2F on the iPad or iPhone. Some people noticed that we were giving them contradictory advice: do as much as you can on your iPhone, the one place where you can't use the security key we gave you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sucked that the keys didn't work with Safari, Firefox (at the time), or with Microsoft Exchange. Twitter, unfathomably, added U2F support but didn't allow for multiple keys (a necessity for political campaigns, where Twitter logins are shared). Even the sites that support security keys still have &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;abysmal documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone needs to start mass-producing fun, designy security keys that look cool on a keychain. The day I see a Hello Kitty security key is the day I know that phishing is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The candidate&lt;/strong&gt;. The candidate was hardest person to secure. They were too busy to come to the training. They didn't want to move off their Loudong SB250 phone because it had all their favorite Flash games from the Yahoo store on it. Three different antivirus programs competed for dominion over their Windows 7 laptop.
&lt;p&gt;A mulish obstinacy is almost a pre-requisite for running for office (since you spend all of your time deflecting requests from people who want you to do stuff). That, in turn makes it very hard to change a candidate's habits. And without support at the top, it's hard to get everyone else to take the problem seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tech expert.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a breed of person who loves locking stuff down and playing secret decoder ring, and will make life a nuisance in the name of security. A particularly challenging case is people whose background is in military or corporate IT. They see personal accounts as a threat to be banned from the campaign, rather than the main thing they needed to be defending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.C. people.&lt;/strong&gt; These are characters from &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt; come to life. They dress in suits, are very busy, and radiate contempt for the politically unconnected. They can arrive on a campaign either as consultants, or as full-time campaign staff. The problem with them is their email habits. They communicate exclusively by Word attachments sent from their AOL account, and will not use Signal. Having no point of leverage over these people, I couldn't do more than watch them come in to a campaign and blow everything up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering the training for free&lt;/strong&gt;. I wish I had charged campaigns a lot of money for the training, so they would put a proper value on the help they received. Campaigns didn't realize they were being given priority access to some of the best security people in the country. Thanks to this informal network of do-gooders, I was able to escalate stuff arbitrarily high to get help or answers, often in a matter of minutes. But to a campaign, it looked like a stranger begging for scraps of their valuable time.
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, there would be a billing model where the training is free, but the campaign gets charged thousands of dollars for ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Whose job should this be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this stuff felt exciting and patriotic. I got platinum frequent flyer status! It fed my sense of self-importance and helped me achieve new heights of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who should actually be doing this stuff for real? And why aren't they? I'll cover that in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Interview with DuckDuckGo CEO Gabe Weinberg</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/27/18639284/duckduckgo-gabe-weinberg-do-not-track-privacy-legislation-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/27/18639284/duckduckgo-gabe-weinberg-do-not-track-privacy-legislation-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;4eWt8G&quot;&gt;People don’t realize just how much they’re being tracked online, says DuckDuckGo CEO Gabe Weinberg — but he’s confident that once they learn how much tech companies like Google and Facebook are quietly slurping up their private data, they will demand a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;umFNqd&quot;&gt;“They’re getting purchase history, location history, browsing history, search history,” Weinberg said on the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Recode Decode with Kara Swisher.&lt;/em&gt; “And then when you go to, now, a website that has advertising from one of these networks, there’s a real-time bidding against you, as a person. There’s an auction to sell you an ad based on all this creepy information you didn’t even realize people captured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xOu1CW&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-minded search engine that has about &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;1 percent of the search market share in the US&lt;/a&gt; (Google’s share is more than 88 percent), as well as a free browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that blocks ad networks from tracking you. But rather than waiting for a comprehensive privacy bill to lurch through Congress over many years, he’s proposed a small, simple tweak to US regulations that might help: Make not being tracked by those networks the default, rather than something you have to opt into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mXV2Ec&quot;&gt;“The fact that consumers have already adopted it and it’s in the browser is just an amazing legislative opportunity, just give it teeth,” he said. “It’s actually a better mechanism for privacy laws because once you have this setting and it works, you don’t have to deal with all the popups anymore. You just set it once, and then sites can’t track you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;FJYqxG&quot;&gt;You can listen to &lt;em&gt;Recode Decode&lt;/em&gt; wherever you get your podcasts, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1555657&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Frecode-decode-hosted-by-kara-swisher%2Fid1011668648%3Fmt%3D2&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/47jQcyRcrM1EoV0sU39N9F&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1JlY29kZS1EZWNvZGU%3D&quot;&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pca.st/recode&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/itunes1011668648/recode-decode-hosted-by-kara-swisher&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LFNe2q&quot;&gt;Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Gabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;CqGW2r&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;xeLtXJ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kara Swisher: We’re going to very quickly bring up Gabe, come on up, Gabe Weinberg. He’s from DuckDuckGo. We’re going to talk about the awfulness of Google now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F0qdlg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rJKcXk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is Gabe. He’s the founder and CEO of DuckDuckGo. This is another search engine, you do have a choice in this world, whether you know it or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cNYLF5&quot;&gt;Yes, you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TyjmCB&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. Gabe,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/22/18634612/anand-giridharadas-billionaires-philanthropy-zuckerberg-bezos-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we were just talking about inequity and wealth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and stuff like that. Let’s talk about inequity of information, because that’s really what’s happened. We have given over control of our information to one company, really, in this world. I’m going to tell one quick story before you start, so you get a sense of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mk0uiv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was walking, in the early days of Google, with Larry or Sergey, I often can’t tell them apart, and there was a room full of televisions, like a Circuit City. I looked in and they were all on, all these dozens of televisions. I said, “What are you doing?” I think it was Larry, said, “We’re recording all of television.” I was like, “Why?” He said, “So we can figure out a way to search it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;B8Bvz6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I said, “Have you gotten the copyright from those people to do that, have you actually reached out?” He said, “Why should we do that, why do we need to do that?” I said, “Well, because if you record it, then you’ll have it recorded, then you’ll have the search for it, and then nobody else can do it, and then you’ll dominate it.” He was like, “Uh-huh.” I was like, “That’s wrong to do that.” He was like, “Okay,” and we moved on. It was a really interesting moment for me that they really were super interested in owning every piece of information on the planet. It was a revelatory moment for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GogkGo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk about what we have now. Talk a little bit about DuckDuckGo first, about what you’re trying to do, because you have been a search engine for how long?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jByhc1&quot;&gt;Eleven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gGE3b0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. Talk about what you do precisely and how it contrasts with Google.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x7InFp&quot;&gt;Yeah. DuckDuckGo is a general internet privacy company at this point, and we help you essentially escape the creepiness and tracking on the internet. We’ve been running this non-tracking search engine alternative to Google for 11 years. We’re doing about a billion searches a month, it’s about 1 percent of market share in the US now, fourth-largest search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fRBslS&quot;&gt;Then we also operate a mobile browser and browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that block trackers across the internet. As you’re expressing, Google and Facebook are the largest purveyors of these trackers, but we block trackers from hundreds of companies, and then we also enable more encryption on the internet. When you go to a website, there’s a http/https version. Sometimes sites have the unencrypted version and the encrypted version, but they send you to the unencrypted version, so we force you to go to the ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uSMk6I&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s in order to follow you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Z2NwyQ&quot;&gt;Yeah. We force you to go to the encrypted version, which helps your ISPs stop from tracking you. It’s all one download that just helps you escape tracking on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Qm6Hcw&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to do this? Because a while ago, everyone was welcoming this idea of convenience. I think&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/3/18/18270522/margrethe-vestager-europe-competition-commissioner-recode-decode-kara-swisher-podcast-interview-sxsw&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margrethe Vestager said that to me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, is that we’ve traded convenience for something better, and she was talking about search engines she uses in Europe that are different. Google’s convenient, Google has mail, Google has maps, Google has this. I’m using that because you’re in the search business. Why did you decide to do this in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vRI3z2&quot;&gt;Well, I have a tech policy background, my graduate degree is in tech policy from MIT, and I originally got into search actually because I was interested in search, but immediately after launching it, I started getting privacy questions. This was well before Snowden still, 2008. So, I did my own investigation and found two really interesting things. One, searches are essentially the most private thing on the internet. You just type in all your deepest, darkest secrets ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xCFd6R&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, absolutely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0vRw6u&quot;&gt;... and search, right? The second thing is, you don’t need to actually track people to make money on search. Google still to this day, and there’s been Congressional testimony ... actually, the hearing that I was at, the representative from Google said this, they still make most of their money off the same way DuckDuckGo makes money, contextual advertising, nothing to do with following you around. It’s keywords on the search page. You type in “car,” you get a car ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7lwSLI&quot;&gt;And you can do that without tracking anybody, so what I realized pretty quickly is that’s a better user experience, and just made the decision not to track people. At the beginning of that, that wasn’t the main differentiator, because we weren’t as aware of all the privacy harms, but as time has gone on, it’s become the main driver for people to adopt DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nN0sUf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To adopt that. Talk about contextual advertising, because this is just a basic business, you type whatever. If you think about Google or what you are, search is like a database of human intentions, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cc204l&quot;&gt;Yes. It’s a great history of advertising, and I think it helps to explain the current market. It used to be the case, as you’re saying, when the internet started all the way up until the mid-2000s, this contextual advertising was basically all advertising. On search, it was just the context of the page, but it was also the case on publisher sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ajcJp5&quot;&gt;I’m sure you remember, sites used to sell their own ads, they would put advertising based on the content of the article. And then the mid-2000s, it switched to behavioral advertising, which is the creepy ads, the ones that kind of follow you around the internet. Two companies dominate that because they have all the data on people: Google and Facebook. But there’s been no real proof that that is really better, and it’s arguably way worse for the publishers who then have ceded all sorts of money to Facebook and ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UEwdGG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk about that shift to behavioral advertising, because when you did it ... Years ago, at Google, also there used to be a ticker that used to run across when you entered Google about what people were searching for at that moment, and they stripped it of dirty stuff, which was quite a bit, apparently. But you would see things like “horses jam French,” and you’d be like, “What the fuck is that person searching for?” I would sit there and I’m like, “I don’t even understand that query.” Talk about how it shifted from that to the idea of behavioral. Why go there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bqwrdx&quot;&gt;What happened is you had publishers selling the biggest inventory, so the top of the page, banner advertising, and then they still wanted to make some more money, so they had ceded the bottom of the page to ad networks that didn’t want to sell. Google’s was the biggest, it was AdSense, based on a company they actually acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ht0TgN&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Called DoubleClick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0zff5I&quot;&gt;Before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WSjMa9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before DoubleClick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rB7T8w&quot;&gt;Yeah, the one before that, and then they acquired DoubleClick in 2007. Slowly, publishers ceded some of their page over to it, and then Google ended up having all this behavioral data, so if you searched for something, you could then follow people around with that search. Those advertisements became more lucrative, and then slowly, publishers ceded most of their page over to this behavioral advertising. However, my proposition is innovation in contextual advertising hasn’t happened in the last 10 years, and it may be just as lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rXfBJ7&quot;&gt;You can imagine videos, articles, similarly parsing out what the real content of it is and putting ads just based on that, not based on you. There’s been a little evidence of this after GDPR. New York Times, for example, got rid of all the behavioral advertising in Europe and saw an increase in revenue. Now, partly that’s because they just got rid of the middleman, but partly that’s because it actually is useful advertising. Like, you write an article on airplanes, and you have an airplane ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZudHhS&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. Why the shift then, to behavioral? Because they just decided to do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Sdm5yg&quot;&gt;Yeah. It’s strategic for their companies, because if you think about their position, they’re the ones with the data monopolies, so if they are going to run an ad network, they should run it based on behavioral because no one can compete with them on that. The real reason why that’s enabled is because there’s been no real regulation in tech that would have prevented that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SlWSlN&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, there’s zero regulation, right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M7S0mi&quot;&gt;There’s the one from 230, but that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1ObHAI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. Talk about 230. Do people know what Section 230 is? Well, those who don’t, it’s the Communications Decency Act, which I wrote about for the Washington Post 109 years ago, was an act that they put through, most of which was stripped out, most of the act was deemed ... It was started by people who were worried about dirty stuff on the internet, essentially.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TIPGjm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the Communications Decency Act was Section 230, which gave internet companies broad immunity from anything that happened on their platform, and it was designed so that these companies would be able to grow and not be sued to death, essentially, and their businesses would be able to ... They were small businesses at the time, and it continues to protect big companies like Google and Facebook [and] YouTube.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;o2syGp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when you mention the idea of ... There’s been some eking away at 230 around sex trafficking and some other things, but essentially, if you mention&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/4/11/18306834/nancy-pelosi-speaker-house-tech-regulation-antitrust-230-immunity-kara-swisher-decode-podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the idea of removing 230&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to internet companies, they start immediately vomiting on their shoes because it would mean they would be subject to legal attacks, which would be unprecedented, presumably. Correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RyNsbq&quot;&gt;Yeah. I think it’s the specter of any regulation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vCMsLl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bmorEm&quot;&gt;But the idea that there would be no regulation on digital forever is ridiculous. I mean, every other area of technology has regulation to pull back some of these externalities. So, I think it’s inevitable, just a matter of what it looks like and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7wSH8J&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. They moved to behavioral advertising. I want to get to that legislation in a second, because you were proposing your own legislation, correct? They get this behavioral information. Talk a little bit about what it does, because people are very unclear about what happens when this occurs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BncFTX&quot;&gt;Essentially, these trackers exist across the web. When you go to a website like Recode, there are trackers hiding behind it. You &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you’re just interacting with the site you’re on, but really, there are companies like Google and Facebook and many others slurping up your information and your browsing history. Through these various mechanisms, they’re getting purchase history, location history, browsing history, search history, and when you add all that together ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9kZPcD&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And made more important by mobile because ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rSpiua&quot;&gt;Yeah, exactly. It’s harder to block stuff on mobile, you get location, much more granular. Some of these are sending like hundreds of data points a day, so you get a really robust profile of you, and then when you go to, now, a website that has advertising from one of these networks, there’s a real-time bidding against you, as a person. There’s an auction to sell you an ad based on all this creepy information you didn’t even realize people captured. I think that’s what people are finally starting to realize, and they’ve been going on the idea that they were just interacting with this one website, but once they find out that all this tracking is going on, they become incensed, effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tfq65T&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think people are actually mad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6zKU5U&quot;&gt;I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Uj2ykU&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain that to me, because a lot of the tech companies, they don’t care about this, they don’t care about privacy. I just interviewed Scott McNealy recently, who’s a ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ENhtqw&quot;&gt;He’s a famous one, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6AKU2Y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s famous for saying ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7t3pE1&quot;&gt;For “privacy is dead.” No, “Get over privacy, you have none of it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WTLaAp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You have no privacy,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get over it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2c5Uvz&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9iJnDm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy is dead, get over it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ezQ0NR&quot;&gt;We track this, like do national surveys very closely, and it’s increased again and again and again of people, once they understand what’s going on, they want to take action. There is a setting, which is part of the legislation that our legislation is based off, called “do not track.” In your browser, in most browsers, if you delve into the privacy settings, there’s something that says do not track, and our measurements — and it’s not just us, because Gizmodo measured their sites — between 10 and 25 percent, depending on what you look at, people have enabled that setting. People are like, “No one ever goes into settings and looks at privacy.” That’s not true. Literally, tens of millions of Americans have gone into their browser settings and checked this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cfZGj4&quot;&gt;So, people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care, and that has just climbed up and up and up as the knowledge of the tracking has gone on. Because before you knew about it, you were okay with it because you didn’t realize it was so invasive, but after Cambridge Analytica and all the stories about the tracking, that number just keeps going up and up and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H03o0e&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things a lot of people do bring up with me still, though, is, “Well, I don’t really care. I don’t have much to hide. It doesn’t matter.” I get that all the time. Like, who cares if they know if I went to Best Buy and bought a, whatever I bought. Talk to why that might be not the best way to think about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bxa4C&quot;&gt;There’s two answers to that. One is philosophical, in that privacy is a fundamental human right, and so you don’t need to care or hide anything to exercise your rights. You wouldn’t say that for speech. Just because you have nothing to say doesn’t mean you should never have free speech. That’s kind of on the philosophical side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GvBUEw&quot;&gt;On the harm side, there are some that people don’t realize. A lot of people really don’t like the creepy ads following them around. Some people seem to be fine with that. At a deeper level, there’s this thing called the filter bubble, which is that recommendation algorithms, and in particular, search results, are tailored to you, and that means that you’re not seeing what everyone else is seeing, and that actually distorts the democracy. That’s a real harm to individual people and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ysG54H&quot;&gt;Then there’s just the general identity theft and data breaches, which is happening over and over again, which is one of the main drivers for adopting stuff like DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8t0GW4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve created legislation that you would like someone ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wILZ3q&quot;&gt;Model legislation, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ySZVRe&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... that you would like someone to submit to Congress. Explain what you want to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3xuPMU&quot;&gt;This isn’t a landscape of all the privacy legislation, and I would love to hear the nuance of it ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;o77pwJ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, just to understand, we do not have a national privacy bill in this country, at all. Other countries do, and much more stringent, like GDPR in Europe, but we don’t have one. We have one in California that’s ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mdJ8iM&quot;&gt;CCPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wuPTFg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... about to come online, but the lobbyists are trying to de-fang it rather substantively. There are 10 others in states across the country. There are certain states that are doing that, I think Louisiana has one. There’s all kinds of states.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hnWCo5&quot;&gt;Vermont has a data broker law. A lot ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tqOA69&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s hope Alabama doesn’t have one, but go ahead. Sorry, but Jesus Christ. All right. There’s too much of a patchwork of them, correct, across the country, the idea. There’s not a national bill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k8YMWn&quot;&gt;There’s no national bill. We really should have a national bill like GDPR, but one of the problems with GDPR is how it’s operationalized a lot of consent dialogs, and that’s called notice and consent, and people just end up clicking the consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hlTL3g&quot;&gt;We think a better mechanism is this thing that I was talking about earlier, this “do not track” setting in the browser that tens of millions of people already put on, and the fact that consumers have already adopted it and it’s in the browser is just an amazing legislative opportunity, just give it teeth. It’s actually a better mechanism for privacy laws because once you have this setting and it works, you don’t have to deal with all the popups anymore. You just set it once, and then sites can’t track you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8KguKx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should it be set from the beginning as “do not track?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BI5u6i&quot;&gt;This is a debate, whether it should be default on or default off. I would love it to be default ... have to opt out of it, but I’d happy if it was opt in as well because I think people will ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mG4Q48&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, people keep tripping here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V0uOpo&quot;&gt;Outside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CFMp3a&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... the second trip. Hello, sorry. Okay. It was the same guy, okay. It’s the same guy tripping, all right. Now he’s just fucking with me. All right, go ahead, sorry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KD5HVq&quot;&gt;No worries. I think people will opt in ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UlY9Tf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s Google. I don’t care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;S1JbbY&quot;&gt;I think people will opt in if they have the opportunity, and they can opt out of this tracking. What we’re hoping is, there’s two things. One, as you said, California’s getting de-fanged, the California bill. As that happens, the pressure for a federal bill is going down this year because if it’s all de-fanged, there’s no pressure to pass something that preempts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4Jt4Xz&quot;&gt;But still, all the people in the country really want something passed, so one option here is this would be a much simpler thing to pass. Just give a “do not track” mandate for no tracking for that setting. Much easier than comprehensive legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;g1M7Bn&quot;&gt;The other thing is that any comprehensive legislation that gets passed, do not track can be the mechanism. So, we’re hoping that it gets added to any larger bill as the mechanism to help people opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3Tf5qC&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do people&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to opt out? Why do they have to opt into it, I guess, opt into it, because you don’t have to opt into clean water, you don’t have to opt into, like, “I think I’d like my water clean or dirty.” It’s kind of crazy, the stuff that consumers have to do in order to protect themselves compared to almost any other thing they use. You don’t, again, opt in, “I’d like the tires that don’t fall off,” opt in, “I’d like the food that isn’t tainted, please.” Why is that mentality around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PQQNHs&quot;&gt;I think the mentality is around because of the lobbying that it would distort the advertising business model. I would love it to be opt in by default, but in a realistic way, I think if it was operationalized as a way to opt out, I think that would be effective because, as you said before, the other argument is some people don’t care, and that gives people, really, the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TLyV4u&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That they just could leave it there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SZ5EsU&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VuCCRK&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it, operating against a site like Google or a big site where you’re 1 percent? How do you do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;D2BxGo&quot;&gt;It’s been interesting. We try to educate people about privacy and that there are alternatives. Our main issue is just not everybody knows about us. There’s 20 percent of people that we think would be interested in switching to DuckDuckGo, but it’s hard to convey all these privacy concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RvWdRt&quot;&gt;I’ll give you an example. We’ve been talking about the filter bubble for years. In 2012, we ran a study on Google that we think influenced the 2012 election, that’s how long ago it was, but nobody ... we had to speak for 10 minutes to explain what the filter bubble was back then. But after 2016, in the last two years, now we can talk about the filter bubble, just name it and people know what it is, generally. How many people know what the filter bubble is, I’m just curious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MEaOGx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain the filter bubble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uz67IS&quot;&gt;Well, it’s the idea — first of all, that percentage is very high, so I like that — but it’s the idea that for search in particular, as an example, when you search, you expect to get &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; results right? If you searched for gun control or abortion, you expect, we search at the same time right here, you would expect to get the same thing. But that’s actually not what we found when we did a study on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N5PQ3a&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, there could be different search results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Qk9cGf&quot;&gt;Yeah, and people don’t realize that. So in addition, we found that it varies a lot by location, and so if you take that to the extreme, let’s say that voting districts are getting different results for candidates or issues, it can skew the polarization of that district very easily over time. Because people who are undecided are actually searching for these topics, and people generally click on the first link, and if you’re controlling that first link in that district, that’s what people are going to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aU5ILI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do you ... Anand was just talking about the idea of people that shouldn’t have this kind of power having this kind of power. How do you look at it? Because it’s, it is a group of maybe 1,000 people making these decisions in Silicon valley pretty much, if that many.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nEpnfa&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recently, I did an&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/6/18530860/tristan-harris-human-downgrading-time-well-spent-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interview with Tristan Harris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and he was talking about, he called it the “climate change of culture” is what we’re going into. The only positive part about it is there are only 1,000 people whose minds you have to change on this. How do you look at that small amount of people making decisions for the entire world, really? What can we do about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qr6nVI&quot;&gt;Yeah, I look at it structurally, and I think that on the consumer side that we’ve talked about, there needs to be a way to opt out, which would lower the power, right? On the kind of structural business side, at the core of this problem, at least the one that we were talking about here, is data monopolies, right? It’s the collection of data profiles and there are ways to split those up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fYjRHY&quot;&gt;So some people are talking about extreme measures, which I’d be in favor of the spinning off companies, but there are other ways to do it, such as not allowing data to be shared between different business units. So if you’re on Instagram and you are browsing something, that data cannot be shared and used on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N3O16P&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which was precisely the reason Facebook bought that company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k7L956&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mG737w&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5WfgdF&quot;&gt;That’s why it should have been rejected in the first place. But at this point, one thing you could do is legislate, and as part of our proposal is that if you go to that site, you can’t share data back to the other sites. So that would effectively add more competition and less power in these decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UmqyB8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except they sit next to each other. They happen to be on that same ridiculous campus they have, they share the same kombucha stand, so it’s hard to ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AAtZIo&quot;&gt;That’s why the argument for separating them more strictly is pretty solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N8AA5U&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about opening up their data, that they have collected? Both companies, for example — because essentially we’re talking about Facebook and Google pretty much, and Amazon’s just starting to get into that business, the advertising business. It’s two companies right now, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gWjPPT&quot;&gt;Yeah. In the digital advertising market, absolutely. The debate is kind of out on interoperability, which is what that is, it may help in the social network space. It’s less important in the search space because, as I was saying earlier, you actually don’t need these profiles to do good search results. They’re really using search to do ads on YouTube and Gmail and all these other places, and so it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help in social networks to help someone start a social network and be able to switch all your friends a little quicker, but it probably wouldn’t solve Google’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oUCocI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There hasn’t been a major social network started since 2011. Which is amazing, if you think about that. There’s a reason, because why do it? And then, and for the rest of it, I think it’s just Snapchat, correct? [Evan Spiegel’s] the chief product officer for Facebook right now, as far as I can tell, because they steal all his ideas. So how do you then shift that? How do you stop that? Just separating them? Which of the ways you think should happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ebVMju&quot;&gt;I really think you have to get to the core of this data monopoly. That’s the key, and I think part of the problem actually has been that market definition, as people think of it as search markets, social network market. It’s what you saw in Congress too, but it really is a digital advertising market, that’s where the domination is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;X8viTV&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WTr1tb&quot;&gt;So you have to change the digital advertising market. You can do that by putting in more Chinese walls between the companies. You could do that by doing something like do not track, which would force companies to be more contextual. So all of a sudden you’d be steering the industry back to the contextual from the behavioral, because 25 percent of people now would advertise on contextual, behavioral will be outlawed for them. So that would just break up the competitive advantage, basically, of the data profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aZHN9H&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have behavior, do you think that’s even possible? Because the idea is adding more, with AI is adding more and more behavioral data in order to track you and accompany, in countries like China and other places, they’re using that behavioral data very — they’re using a lot of it including facial recognition. The companies here I think are just&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to get into facial recognition and know the controversies around it. So it doesn’t seem like backing away from behavioral, there’s something, they seem to be doubling down in behavioral.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wLiTdx&quot;&gt;That’s why I believe you need government regulation in it, and to your point, you can look at China as an example, and so not only should you push things back to contextual, but you probably should have some lines, bright lines, that you can’t cross in behavioral. Right? You saw San Francisco ban it the other day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8BTN7K&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/14/18623897/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-explained&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;banned facial recognition software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;being used in the city. Is that correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lTVyUg&quot;&gt;Yeah, that’s right. For government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2Br8E5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dVNwlw&quot;&gt;Another good example, which isn’t talked about that much, is political advertising on Facebook. So you know, there’s ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EBxsTA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh it’s talked about a lot, yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9YVola&quot;&gt;Yeah, well not this part, there’s this disclosure, but arguably there should be a ban on behavioral advertising to some level of people, just blanket for political advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AMwN7x&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To some level of people. What do you mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UeeS0g&quot;&gt;Like 1,000 people or 10,000, you could pick your cutoff and then say you cannot target ads at a population less than that amount. Because what’s happening now is the behavioral advertising just targeting you, right? Or a very small amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Otwq95&quot;&gt;And it’s using, it’s manipulative in two ways. You can manipulate the targeting, so I can select just the three or five people that I think would totally be triggered by this. You could also do A/B testing and change words and images to get like the perfect manipulation. Tristan Harris has better words for this, I forget what he says, but the brainstem ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LjuyDg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, that goes down the brainstem, yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qbuT1e&quot;&gt;Right, and that kind of stuff should be, probably, outlawed. Especially for political advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bGaMLl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To individualized people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3iGrCd&quot;&gt;Yeah, but it manages individual probably at some threshold that’s significantly high. They can make the argument, “Oh this is just like TV, our disclosures are going to be like TV.” Well, you can’t target, well you might be able to eventually, which also should be outlawed, but in TV, you weren’t targeting down to the individual person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;msBZph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, you were targeting great groups of people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NGBo1O&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QRQUc5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also couldn’t just put ads up the way they do on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;on6peP&quot;&gt;Right, and do all this testing you couldn’t do, you can’t test 1,000 ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2oUDEr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So do you think our regulators are up to this task? So you’re writing your own legislation, I’m assuming you’re running your company at the same time and you don’t, you’re not a legislator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SE0K03&quot;&gt;That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hKszU4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do you look at our legislators? Is there more strength elsewhere in the world or in this country? Let’s talk just about this country, because I think most people saw the Facebook hearings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XGTKot&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;D5zXjm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark looked great in that hearing and he’s not the most articulate of people. It’s largely because most of the legislators looked so bad and looked so ignorant. So when you say Mark looks so good, it was because it was such a low, low bar that it was hard not to. I think they could have put a ham sandwich there, and it would have looked pretty good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z5lDhH&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that said, I have talked to legislators who are quite smart. There’s a lot of them in Washington, and especially in the regulatory agencies and elsewhere. What’s the problem from a regulatory ... is it the money? These companies are throwing it at lobbyists, at them, or is it just a lack of will, or is it ignorance? How does that change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;peeHlt&quot;&gt;Right. So to answer your first question, there are very smart people there and just like running a company, they hire staff and there’s lots of Senators who have hired really good tech staff, and there was a handful, maybe five to 10, and they’re writing, they’re trying to write some of this legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nh8qnq&quot;&gt;So I don’t think you need the whole Senate writing it, for example. So I’m actually pretty encouraged in that regard, the level of thought that’s been going into some of these proposals. I think that writing something like GDPR &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; complicated, Europe was doing it for 20 years, I mean, it was an update of a 1995 law and then they took five years to update it, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3h69I1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;A9fICK&quot;&gt;So we’re just getting started this year, so there is some amount of time that it will take. That’s one reason we proposed this legislation, because you can do this right now. This is an easy thing you could do. Solving a lot of it all at once is difficult. I prefer to do it a little bit in piecemeal as opposed to just one thing and then be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XL2J6f&quot;&gt;That’s the other thing I don’t really like about our government system is, we pass something and then we don’t touch it for 20 years, which is what happened to the CDA. It would be better if we pass something every year or two and kind of tweaked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lchqUv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do you imagine that they will do? You mentioned, of the many different things that are happening? Like right now the FTC is considering fining Facebook $5 billion, which I called a parking ticket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0aL9qk&quot;&gt;Yes, I agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5vqVj5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you. I’m correct.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KSwrvA&quot;&gt;Need another zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xHKmQf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two zeros, actually, I’ve decided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XZP7Tz&quot;&gt;That would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xjI9pZ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two zeros would, yes, that would do it. But the concept is fining them. Taxing them is another way. Regulatory guardrails is another way, and breakup — antitrust action, for presumably break up — and then not letting them buy anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n6jS1k&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DsFPYF&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of those things, what do you imagine is the most effective right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V3QQvG&quot;&gt;I think not letting them buy things would be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M08XQs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nip48U&quot;&gt;Anything that gets at, if you’re talking about Google and Facebook and the digital advertising market, anything that gets at the data monopoly would be good. Of those, breaking up could do it, China’s wall could do it, do you not track could do it. All of those would do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CT3F1Y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time do you imagine it will take? There is a techlash going on right now, and it’s largely because of the 2016 election and the idea that the Russians were customers of these companies. When do you imagine ... do you imagine that will continue, or do you think it’s gonna peter out? And the next then, how dangerous is it for the next elections that these continue to be issues? Do you think these companies have finally sort of come to Jesus and said, “Oh dear, we’ve made some errors here.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LFMxNg&quot;&gt;I think you’re seeing that because all of their announcements have just been centered around privacy, right? So they’re feeling this is a real thing at this point. Maybe Scott McNealy is still saying that, but everybody else is now embracing at least the word “privacy,” whether they mean it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vbXtow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zazy9e&quot;&gt;I think you’re gonna see the techlash continue until people think there’s some meaningful change. I worry about the breakup because that takes a really long time, historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RUriyV&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2AwWLI&quot;&gt;Some of these other things can be done much quicker, so I’m hoping that something will get done quicker. I’m a little saddened by what’s happened in California, because I think that’s slowing things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3hHrX7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SKz6hg&quot;&gt;But what I haven’t heard anyone talk about, which is interesting, is that got started by a ballot measure, for people who don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;w0EGUs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything in California gets started like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Is9iD0&quot;&gt;One person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oVC7Od&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure, just so you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FElHLl&quot;&gt;Yeah, one person did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kqJPue&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FDsYbY&quot;&gt;There’s nothing to stop somebody from doing it again if it gets watered down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MOuTnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That, someone put on something else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PJKZP8&quot;&gt;Yeah, or just put out the same thing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5BLPG5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LFruIL&quot;&gt;You know, if it gets totally watered down, just do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7C9lIG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yet we don’t have privacy in place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eJ9V1Q&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So talk just very quickly, we just have a few more minutes. What can people do right now, besides using DuckDuckGo, what is some of the things they should be doing to protect themselves online and things that they don’t realize they’re being tracked — besides, please, please don’t buy one of their internet home devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9VRwAp&quot;&gt;Yeah, that would be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zpc90t&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. My son goes around and unplugs them all in our house. Yeah, they don’t work. They make lovely paperweights, but go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FgE3To&quot;&gt;Facebook is an interesting challenge. I haven’t been a Facebook user for a long time, and there’s plenty of studies that show that’s a healthy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51b9ay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k4ioZR&quot;&gt;But there aren’t great alternatives to it, and so that one, I think you should leave, and a lot of people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2G7cPR&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just leave Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BZ8fc9&quot;&gt;Just leave it, yeah. For Google, there are actually alternatives in every category. So we’re in search, but there’s alternatives in emails, alternatives in ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;52SbhT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such as?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xRzN0P&quot;&gt;ProtonMail is a big one, we use FastMail at DuckDuckGo, and in you know docs, there’s things like Zoho, they’re not all super private like us, but they’re often paid, but cheap alternatives that put privacy first. So I would leave the services because the idea that alternatives don’t exist is just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RXgssh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, although it’s inconvenient because they all work together on your phones or whatever you have, they all seamlessly work together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kK6o5d&quot;&gt;You know, I’ve been out for a long time, but it’s totally productive. I mean, you just click on a different app on your phone. They’re on your home screen, you go into a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mCvABF&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. What else should people do to protect themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fPvIhv&quot;&gt;So in the devices themselves, there’s a bunch of privacy settings that actually matter, and we have a blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/&quot;&gt;spreadprivacy.com&lt;/a&gt; with advice tips that we just, education, wrote it all up. There are things like you can turn off the ad tracking on a lot of ... on Apple, for instance, you can use encryption end-to-end. You could basically encrypt your — Apple is by default — but you can do your laptop. These are things that take like an hour, but you run through the checklist and then you’re a lot more private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a4mY3X&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So encryption, encrypting your laptop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MxUOv7&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3AeYpE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypting your phone or having a phone ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qBFnon&quot;&gt;Encrypting everything, changing, basically doing all the opt outs you can do, which, we have a list and you can run through the settings. Then switching off of these services, kind of voting with your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ySisNL&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about mapping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1O6IGm&quot;&gt;So we use Apple Maps for our surface knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n5GPkA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’re such bad maps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d68ymX&quot;&gt;They are — they have gotten a lot better. I’m sure I would give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KtOwR5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. Okay. Because they’re terrible maps. That’s why, I mean, it’s hard not to use a Google Map because they’re so good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tcCYk4&quot;&gt;I would give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N0BKC8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. All right. Anything else? Any other things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e0Qmqy&quot;&gt;Those are the top ones, because I don’t want to scare people that it’s difficult. You know, it really is, you spend a few minutes on this and you can be out. I think people think it’s such a gargantuan thing to leave these companies, and I don’t think that’s actually true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eYtR81&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about cameras and audio? Just so you know, when I was visiting Facebook I noticed Mark had his camera covered, had his audio covered, he had everything covered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cfl0wz&quot;&gt;Yeah, absolutely. When you, people conflate privacy and security a lot, but I totally agree. So on the security side you should definitely have a webcam cover and use two-factor authentication. You know that thing that texts you all the time, you should use that for all services. So most services that you have your ... your email is the most important, but you can set up this two-factor authentication much better because most of the hacks that have happened, a lot of the identity theft has all been from phishing on your email and you know, you click on something, type in your password, and two-factor authentication is just another layer that prevents that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tT6qOK&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right, and covering... When you get into things like facial recognition and other issues, as people start to use VR and AR and things like that, what would you advise people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5f29zb&quot;&gt;Facial recognition is hard. There are ways to actually change, like wear things that change your face so you don’t get captured by the cameras, but I think that ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;epb8mx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear things and change your face?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TE7zub&quot;&gt;Yeah, you can like ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ds5Ng3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mask, it’s called a mask. But go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hFxpR9&quot;&gt;Yeah, more minor things, I forget what it was, but you can like put like aluminum foil or something that freaks things out, but I’m not recommending that. You don’t see me wearing it. I think the problem with facial is you’re going to need laws with some of this stuff, and so San Francisco’s great, starting the trend there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iF1RDZ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. To not to — not to use ... and companies not use facial recognition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZDiYLg&quot;&gt;Yeah. You’re going to need, that one is going to need to be solved at a more societal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iA1nn2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think people realize how much facial recognition is used in this country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RxEBoR&quot;&gt;No, not at all. There was a, the privacy project, the New York Times, I assume you’re aware, there was a really interesting story two weeks ago where they took, I don’t know if you read that one, they took camera ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FjZdqX&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/facebook-google-monopolies.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was part of the project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wgFgo7&quot;&gt;You were part of that story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;W2zrvF&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, no, that project, but go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pDQz1A&quot;&gt;Oh yeah, so they took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/16/opinion/facial-recognition-new-york-city.html&quot;&gt;live webcam footage&lt;/a&gt; that was just on a camera and just put it up on Amazon with their facial recognition off-the-shelf stuff, and then were able to then identify a bunch of different people. They called them up and was like, “I saw you walking here.” It took $100 and like three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;D7myAl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. Well, exactly. They also are using things much more seriously in workplaces to watch your face as you work, and also to decide whether to hire you based on your facial expressions. What they’re trying to do right now, from what I understand, some of the new software will track your face and expressions during an interview and then match it to their top performers whose faces they were also tracking and therefore don’t hire you if you’re not one of their top performer’s facial expressions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x9dIYL&quot;&gt;It’s crazy. It’s another area, just bias in algorithms in general. But this is to your earlier point, is that a central point about regulation is there’s been no regulation for 20 years, right? So there’s just a dearth of regulation. And you’re not going to solve it in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3ouvOJ&quot;&gt;So this bias in algorithms probably needs to be a separate bill, right? AI in general, this area, facial recognition. We need to tackle these problems separately, but they are the biggest problems and so we should be doing it year after year. I worry that it’s going to be a checkbox, that we pass something and then it’s going to be done. We’re just going to have to keep the pressure on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ONI8Dn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever imagine — and then I’ll get to questions from the audience — that we’ll ever escape the enormous power of something like Google? Because what it’s become, it is the answer machine for everything, really. Even though you have 1 percent that’s ... They have 90 percent everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hOsAtY&quot;&gt;Yeah, I do. I think if we have these structural changes, I think you could see the market open up. We are a small company, we’re only 55 people, and to be like “How do you compete?” I mentioned earlier we use Apple Maps, right? We could debate how good they are. But in each of these verticals there are actually really good answers. So Yelp for restaurants, which we use. We use Wikipedia, just like Google does for ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cxB999&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Yelp is getting crushed by Google, they’ve talked about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;njgDmQ&quot;&gt;Yeah, exactly. But it’s not like their answers aren’t good, right? So if the market opened up a bit, these companies could thrive more. And we use them and put together good search results just based on all these other companies. I think that the idea that they’re this magic AI that no one can compete with I think is false. Because if you look around in all these categories, there actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RGl21L&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But given that the amount of money they have, the amount of money they make, and the fact that consumers like them, like using them. I think one of the issues around all these tech companies is Amazon’s so great about delivery even though they’re ruining the lives of retailers across the country. I’m sorry about that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7q4Dwk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or causing people to have job ... Or their contractors are treated badly within the stores. But gosh, they delivered my iced tea really quickly and it’s delicious. Or Google, they’re a horrible monopoly and yet wow, they were fast on giving me that answer if so-and-so is alive anymore. Or whatever they decide. I always search people if they’re dead or not, so go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a1CqUK&quot;&gt;Trust in Facebook has precipitously dropped in the past year, and so I don’t think it’s inevitable that trust is always at high levels, even if people kind of like, come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tjmaSG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, trust in Facebook has dropped, usage has not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Morzqc&quot;&gt;Yes, well that’s because there has not been a great alternative, right? People don’t necessarily believe or want to believe the healthiness of quitting. But trust itself has eroded. So I think trust could erode in these other companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZjHRy2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you worried about who runs these companies at some point? Because one of my worries has always been ... Many years ago, I wrote a story about Google trying to take over Yahoo search. I think I’ve talked about this before. It was going to get them 90 percent of the market at this point. Yahoo was still a substantively large search, did substantively large search business, and Microsoft was the third one. I was struck by, they can’t have 90 percent. Why isn’t our government stepping in to do something about that? That’s a ridiculous amount of market share.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nDb7sx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So a line I wrote was, “At least Microsoft knew they were thugs.” Google pretends they’re all happy with their funny balls and their crazy eating habits and their weird clothes and stuff like that, but they’re still, as adorable as they are, they’re still just as evil as Microsoft was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;E8o3DZ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I was making that point and I think it was Eric Schmidt who called me up and said, “That’s really mean, that you say we’re thugs.” And I said, “Well, I think you’re worse than thugs because you don’t know you’re thugs. And you are thugs, and therefore you’re worse than thugs.” And he was like, “We’re not thugs, we’re really good people. We’re really good people.” And I said, “I get that, but I can’t imagine a world where you have a company of this much power over information. What if someone ... “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2y5s2O&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course it’s like three clicks to Hitler, but that’s what I said. It was like, “But what if Hitler ran Google? What if someone who wasn’t so nice ran Google?” And it was like, “Well, they don’t!” And I was like, “Yes, but what if they do?” And he said, “But they don’t!” So are you worried about the concentration of power in the hands of, again, a very small amount of people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SBHASl&quot;&gt;Yeah. Absolutely. I worry that you’re basically saying they intend good, right? It’s like, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” I believe, we did this filter bubble study that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; influence the 2012 election. Now, a lot of people on the left liked the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VaS5cz&quot;&gt;What we found, by the way, was when you searched for stuff, we found this thing called magic keywords, where if you search for something, and you search for something subsequent, you would get extra results inserted based on the previous search. So “Obama” was a magic keyword. So if you searched for “Obama” and then “gun control,” you’d get three gun control results in the results. “Romney” was not a magic keyword. So all these people ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zn5qcY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, no he was not a magic keyword.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WW6LPy&quot;&gt;Yeah. So all these people searched for Romney and Obama and there were tens of millions of extra Obama results inserted across the country for that entire run-up to the election. We don’t know what that changed, but I presume it actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; change a lot. Because people were searching just random issues that they wanted to hear about and they were just getting Obama’s take on it, not Romney’s take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gnt3mQ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you believe that was purposeful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EvjIDw&quot;&gt;No, I don’t. I think it’s totally unintentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;begORs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b74P4K&quot;&gt;It was a result of the algorithm and they were questioned on it, and they were basically like, “Oops,” and the answer was, “When we created these magic keywords, Romney was less popular at the time.” It was a year before. And that just happened. But it was probably a tiny change that no one even knew about that had a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lUYqs7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Questions from the audience. Lots of them, let’s start here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MW9uSY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for being here. I have a question about how this conversation could or should change once it moves from the digital world. So a lot of times when we talk about privacy, especially tonight, we’re talking about digital-first problems, or problems that are because of digital-first companies. But specifically the advertising example, now we’re seeing addressable advertising on TV, where you can be just as targeted as you are online in your TV screen. And that can change depending on who they think are in the room at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eKPygx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, and streaming. It’s because of streaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4dvpSu&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. All of it. How does that conversation change now that it’s not just digital and it’s really everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gFcfFA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; In a sense, it is digital because the streaming, the conversion from analog to digital on TV, is a digital conversion, it just doesn’t feel digital because it doesn’t look like you’re browsing the internet. But a lot of it is still going over the internet. So if you had something like do not track it could apply to all of these mechanisms, as long as it remains digital. So I think it would apply to that situation, as well as the billboards. You know, there’s been talk about individualized billboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rTmxc0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, you saw the Tom Cruise movie,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minority Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, right? They clicked his eyes and then it says, “Hello, Mr. Nakamura. Would you like more fleece culottes?” Or whatever the heck he wanted last time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;r2WVTh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, addressable ads from cable boxes, that comes through the data that cable companies have. Doesn’t necessarily ... I mean, yes, if you probably could have some digital information coming and bleeding into that, but it’s grown ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ro6Nlx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, they want to get the same information Google gets. Cable companies and telcos now are able now to get the kind of ... Because they’re like, “If they can get it, why can’t we get it?” And usually telcos were prohibited from getting that kind of ... And the point is, you’re right, if they get it, why don’t we get it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GZ6ZHt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I agree with your premise that they’re trying to copy the tracking business model everywhere to compete. And if it’s outlawed in one place, it should be outlawed everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Xq0nWu&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yep. Next question. Oh, you had one here, you didn’t ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F7sRIl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a silly question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zaddvI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Czw9wS&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Why’d you name it DuckDuckGo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5Yy2IX&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a good question! That’s not a silly question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2cAsPG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi. It is a good question, and I wish I had a good answer, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NnJDXy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do know the answer to that, but go ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7R1BXG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Which I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cnBzH7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;fun game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XCdc3u&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Duck Duck Goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V2VuE6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; It was a good question then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L1O1LZ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;B2YCOw&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is. Go ahead, go ahead, you had no ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fnTXIX&quot;&gt;That’s exactly it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jZ5jZ0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where were you? You were sitting there and going, “Oh, it’s either going to be like Blue Geese or Duck Duck Go?” What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5C2Tt1&quot;&gt;So I was on a walk with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nZC5Dl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YtJrEM&quot;&gt;Pre-even having a company, and I was going to start something, and I was like, “That’s a cool name.” And didn’t know what the company was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nw0Cfd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who thought of the name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YiXqDc&quot;&gt;Me. Just popped in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1pbm1R&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. All right, all right, there you have it. All right, next. Right here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qkPWtg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Do we have the right to be forgotten, and should we have the right to be forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RcAOTH&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8OjnB3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; We currently don’t in the United States. It’s part of GDPR and it’s something we comply with. It’s an interesting question of where to draw that line, and it hasn’t been one taken up very much in the US yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8YTlar&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of the First Amendment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oH5feh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zThdMH&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s never going to happen here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9Cat4L&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; So then if you were going to write an amendment, what would the amendment be to make the right to be forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;acoK3D&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; You would probably need a constitutional amendment, because of the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L4XmjO&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. To change the First Amendment. That’s not happening. But the idea is whether you want it or not, too. If there’s good and bad information about a good person, a bad person could take down good information about them. So it gets into really thorny issues. The same thing around editing tweets, right now. That’s their excuse. There’s lots of ways they could do it, by the way, they could keep ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zCR2C3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it’s also like check the box. So if someone has a history and they’ve paid their debt to society, should they keep getting that time and time again and not being able to move past it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XauB9K&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. Well, you know, they’re not going to change that. But the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HbrQMgOUFw&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;line from the movie&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Social Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, where it’s, “The internet’s written in indelible ink.” So it’s an excellent question, I just don’t think, because of the First Amendment, that it will ever get any traction here. I think every single thing you do online, every drunken college picture, is going to stay there for ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OtZ8VZ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t heard anyone talking about that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mHx2Oc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What, drunken college pictures? I don’t have any, I’m really old. Go ahead, right here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ubjQxN&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; How are we going to help the advertisers who are getting progressively more and more addicted to data, and have built these really robust data sets, even without the Googles and the Facebooks of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6UL3sf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, they have Axiom, others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mirweq&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you can work with Axiom, and you can get lookalikes, you can deliver to them digitally or traditionally. So the issue, I wonder, is also the advertisers, the P&amp;amp;Gs of the world, who are paying, and they’re the ones who are subsidizing and encouraging this by paying for the ads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;krbCXC&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, data’s starting to come out about this. The data so far is that they’re paying for a lot more for not much. Behavioral advertising has not been that effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ShKR2B&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; But they don’t necessarily believe that that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hqswSY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. I agree we need empirical evidence a lot, but I think once they realize that they haven’t been getting much for what they’ve been paying for, they’re totally happy to embrace contextual advertising again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bPRlU&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’ve also given up their relationship with the consumer. Yeah, I had a really interesting&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/4/17/18411242/ken-washington-ford-self-driving-car-artificial-intelligence-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;conversation with the CTO of Ford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and I said, “What’s your biggest problem?” And he said, “Well, the internet companies want to suck every bit of data and chomp it back out, and we want a relationship with the consumer over time.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PWSMWh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They have a very different mentality towards their consumers because they buy things from them. And essentially Google and Facebook are pass-throughs. They don’t care about you. So it’d be interesting to see if they can regain power, because you’re right, it’s not effective for P&amp;amp;G. They do start to realize this, I think they ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ORReKn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; They don’t have any agency right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SXkaFx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; And will they be upset because of the lack of transparency? Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KaWsuf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tx0VDr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a very interesting subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dYnT4B&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, it is. And the question is will these big advertisers ... The problem is the big advertisers are also getting disrupted by an Amazon. Like Amazon’s selling all their Amazon goods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51Spmc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Including advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7gOEN6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, everything. Yeah. Yeah, we didn’t even talk about Amazon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;43y9yJ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, right now they don’t have a lot of choice because all the audience, if you want to reach billions of people, you’ve got to go to Google and Facebook. But if they’re ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OXFMo9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Amazon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ICPhzi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Weinberg:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and Amazon. But if it’s broken up a bit and contextual is back, there can be other ad networks that aren’t Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PiaB0L&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because they are the only road. Okay, any more questions? Last one, right here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dPbMzl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience member:&lt;/strong&gt; Can there be a DuckDuckGo for YouTube?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zDqRLN&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can there be a DuckDuckGo for YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xIcoTY&quot;&gt;It’s a good question. It is one category which I didn’t hit on that doesn’t have a great answer, honestly, right now. And there are great sites to put your video on. So Vimeo is a good example that I use for privacy with my kids’ videos. But unfortunately, if you’re a creator, all the eyeballs are on YouTube. It’s another network effect. So to break that network effect is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8xW1ZH&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s impossible. There’s no other choice, and the expense of doing it is so high. So they can create monopolies without creating monopolies, which is really the question for our legislators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nP2Avw&quot;&gt;Yeah, that’s another legislative question we didn’t address, but that one’s an argument for treating it as a utility at that point. If it’s &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a natural monopoly that nothing can really compete with it, you need to regulate it as a utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rGyhyV&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or change law. Or change the way we do antitrust law. I think there’s interesting people like Lina Khan and others that are talking about how to change the idea of what a monopoly is, and it doesn’t have to cause consumer harm. In fact, it could have consumer good. You all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;all the freebies you get from all these companies. You really do. That’s the problem here, it’s not harmful to consumers. Except it is. It’s harmful to society. But it’s not ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8TtSIk&quot;&gt;Well, there’s an interesting argument. There was another New York Times article from Brian Chen who left Facebook, and he saw ... It’s one anecdote, but it was interesting. He saw his purchases go down by 50 percent on his credit card. So you can say, well, he wasn’t seeing a lot more ads, right? Because he wasn’t on Facebook seeing all the ads. And that’s definitely part of it. But some part of it was also because the ads were probably manipulative, and they were kind of manipulating him into buying stuff. So that’s arguably a direct consumer harm. It was money out of his pocket he wouldn’t have spent otherwise from being manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oAeQZ7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addictiveness, which is something a lot of people are talking, this ... I mean, I don’t use Instagram. I don’t use any of these services, by the way. But I was on Instagram the other day, and I was like, “I must buy that strange little object that they’re ... “ I don’t know what it was, it was some bra that was better than other bras, and it was not. But it was weird, and I don’t know what it was doing to my brain. I was fascinated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Z7IQsT&quot;&gt;Yeah, they probably ran a thousand ads on that thing to like ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8E4ZoC&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was weird.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bfZ1nW&quot;&gt;... get the exact emotional triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bINnAs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn’t buy it. But I was this close.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;peJJhC&quot;&gt;Close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KqcC1d&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close, but not quite. So close. Anyway, thank you so much, Gabe. This is Gabe Weinberg from DuckDuckGo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Power Is Overrated</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/power-is-overrated.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The wish to have power over others is altogether alien to me; I just don’t get it, any more than I get why anyone wants to have kids or play Settlers of Catan. Even sexual fantasies based on power dynamics don’t particularly appeal to me. Why would I want to boss other people around? What would I make them do? My taxes, maybe? It just sounds awkward, and like a huge hassle. I don’t even like being waited on by people I’d rather have a beer with; I’m uncomfortable holding the meager (and mostly illusory) power of grades over my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;However: Doing what &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want, and not being made to do things I &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want to do, has been one of my main priorities in adulthood, the principle around which I’ve structured my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I would define &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; as the ability to make other people do what you want; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; is the ability to do what &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want. Like gravity and acceleration, these are two forces that appear to be different but are in fact one. Freedom is the defensive, or pre-emptive, form of power: the power that’s necessary to resist all the power the world attempts to exert over us from day one. So immense and pervasive is this force that it takes a considerable counterforce just to restore and maintain mere autonomy. Who was ultimately more powerful: the conqueror Alexander, who ruled the known world, or the philosopher Diogenes, whom Alexander could neither offer nor threaten with anything? (Alexander reportedly said that if he weren’t Alexander, he would want to be Diogenes. Diogenes said that if he weren’t Diogenes, he’d want to be Diogenes too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ambition for the more obvious and boring forms of power — political, financial — may not always be inherently evil, but it does tend to have unfortunate side effects in the form of poverty, slave labor, pogroms and unwelcome territorial advances. My own ambition takes the comparatively benign form of artistic ambition (inevitably alloyed with various impurities — desire for recognition, for status, for enough money to get by, for women to like me). Though to be honest, even this seemingly innocuous form of ambition serves an insidiously dictatorial desire: to change what other people think, and how they see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As with most artists, my fondest worldly goal is to be left alone: I dream of an empire the size of my apartment. Which is less attainable than it sounds. Since I was a teenager, my primary artistic role model has been the film director Stanley Kubrick, who was rare in his artistic genius but almost unique in his ability to secure the space necessary for that genius to operate to its maximum by establishing a financial autonomy and a degree of control unheard of in the brutal ecosystem of Hollywood. Autonomy and control: These are indispensable to any artist. Because I lack either the ruthless business savvy or the Napoleonic charisma of a Stanley Kubrick, I’ve tried to solve this problem by keeping my own artistic endeavors low in overhead, devoid of collaborators and as free from editorial interference as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Of course freedom, as is written in the bumper sticker, is not free: I decided long ago that the greatest freedom is the freedom to command one’s own time, and to that end I’ve forfeited a regular salary, home ownership, a retirement plan and any credit rating whatsoever, as well as the cozy fetters of family. Most days it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So freedom is a kind of power; but a certain kind freedom also comes with powerlessness. I was never freer as an artist than when I was drawing a cartoon for an alternative weekly newspaper, a job whose salary maxed out at $20 a week. Because no one paid any attention to what I did, I could call a lie a “lie” at a time when the rest of the press was still tentatively venturing the term “misled.” I could draw a man using a burrito as a sex toy. Once I started publishing essays in one of the most widely read and prestigious newspapers in the world, there suddenly seemed to be many obvious and true things I could no longer write. Needless to say there were to be no more burritos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The more power you attain, the more circumscribed that power becomes. I’ve often thought that, in a sense, one of the least free people on earth must be the president of the United States — an office no one can attain without becoming beholden to campaign donors, lobbyists, party leaders and other invisible fixers, and whose policy options are constrained to the narrow slit of the American political spectrum. Any cabdriver, barber or internet troll can mouth off about his crackpot hypotheses; but if a president accidentally lets slip an authentic, uncensored thought it's called a &quot;gaffe&quot; and costs him approval points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the most essential freedom to secure is the power to move freely within the borders of your own skull. Doing what you want is predicated on knowing what you want. The world’s most insidious power is that which infiltrates your own brain, constricting and deforming what’s permissible to think. It’s almost impossible to writhe out from under the crushing weight of cultural consensus, ideology, propaganda, conventional wisdom and the deafening chatter of other people’s opinions, to harbor your own samizdat thoughts — as Virginia Woolf describes an artist in “To the Lighthouse&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;” “struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say ‘But this is what I see; this is what I see,’ and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Underlying the pathetic quest for all power is fear: the fear of death. Some billionaires are building posh survival compounds and funding Frankensteinian research programs to defeat genetic decline and death. Pretty much everything there is to be said about the vanity of this ambition — vanity in the sense of both egotism and futility — was said by Percy Shelley in “Ozymandias.” The hope of being remembered by getting your name on a book or a cornerstone, a disease or a species, an equation or a star, is no less pitiful and silly than any other stratagem to outsmart mortality, from having children to invading nations. Per Woody Allen: “I don’t want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen; I want to live on in my apartment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The sanest people, I think, are those happily unafflicted with ambition — whether for power, wealth, fame or achievement — who want only to work at some useful job, to love someone and to live in a nice place with some wind chimes on the porch. Maybe a bird feeder. A friend of mine, a fellow writer, once had a hallucinogenic epiphany in which she understood that her own ambition was a displaced craving for affection and approval, for the love of strangers — which, now that she had a loving family of her own, she no longer needed. But that misguided desire had made her what she was, a writer, and that’s what she’ll remain even now that her original motive is obsolete, just as the Parthenon outlasted the faith that built it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ambition has led me to spend 20 years of my life in a clamorous, filthy city I cannot afford, and to devote far too much attention to the soul-shriveling business of self-promotion. Like a lot of artists in New York, I keep imagining that this will be my last year here. I daydream about abandoning all this: moving back to the country, reading a lot, writing something only when I feel like it. I aspire to be — someday, if I have the courage for it — less ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The multi-armed bandit problem (2012)</title>
<link>http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=132</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=132</guid>
<description>&lt;div href=&quot;http://zwibbler.com&quot; readability=&quot;5.8493150684932&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zwibbler.com&quot;&gt;Zwibbler.com&lt;/a&gt; is a drop-in solution that lets users draw on your web site.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A/B testing is used far too often, for something that performs so badly. It is defective by design: Segment users into two groups. Show the A group the old, tried and true stuff. Show the B group the new whiz-bang design with the bigger buttons and slightly different copy. After a while, take a look at the stats and figure out which group presses the button more often. Sounds good, right? The problem is staring you in the face. It is the same dilemma faced by researchers administering drug studies. During drug trials, you can only give half the patients the life saving treatment. The others get sugar water. If the treatment works, group B lost out. This sacrifice is made to get good data. But it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, hundreds of the brightest minds of modern civilization have been hard at work not curing cancer. Instead, they have been refining techniques for getting you and me to click on banner ads. It has been working. Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/search.html#q=bandit&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/bandits/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are focusing on using more information about visitors to predict what to show them. Strangely, anything better than A/B testing is absent from mainstream tools, including Google Analytics, and Google Website optimizer. I hope to change that by raising awareness about better techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a simple 20-line change to how A/B testing works, &lt;strong&gt;that you can implement today&lt;/strong&gt;, you can &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; do better than A/B testing -- sometimes, two or three times better. This method has several good points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can reasonably handle more than two options at once.. Eg, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, Ã¢ï¿½Â¦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New options can be added or removed at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
But the most enticing part is that &lt;strong&gt;you can set it and forget it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.asmartbear.com/value-time.html&quot;&gt;If your time is really worth $1000/hour&lt;/a&gt;, you really don't have time to go back and check how every change you made is doing and pick options. You don't have time to write rambling blog entries about how you got your site redesigned and changed this and that and it worked or it didn't work. Let the algorithm do its job. This 20 lines of code automatically finds the best choice quickly, and then uses it until it stops being the best choice.
&lt;h2&gt;The Multi-armed bandit problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-armed bandit problem takes its terminology from a casino. You are faced with a wall of slot machines, each with its own lever. You suspect that some slot machines pay out more frequently than others. How can you learn which machine is the best, and get the most coins in the fewest trials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many techniques in machine learning, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~vkules/bandits.pdf&quot;&gt;simplest strategy&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/bandit.pdf&quot;&gt;hard to beat&lt;/a&gt;. More complicated techniques are worth considering, but they may eke out only a few hundredths of a percentage point of performance. One strategy that has been shown to perform well time after time in practical problems is the &lt;em&gt;epsilon-greedy&lt;/em&gt; method. We always keep track of the number of pulls of the lever and the amount of rewards we have received from that lever. 10% of the time, we choose a lever at random. The other 90% of the time, we choose the lever that has the highest expectation of rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
def choose():
    if math.random() &amp;lt; 0.1:
        # exploration!
        # choose a random lever 10% of the time.
    else:
        # exploitation!
        # for each lever, 
            # calculate the expectation of reward. 
            # This is the number of trials of the lever divided by the total reward 
            # given by that lever.
        # choose the lever with the greatest expectation of reward.
    # increment the number of times the chosen lever has been played.
    # store test data in redis, choice in session key, etc..

def reward(choice, amount):
    # add the reward to the total for the given lever.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why does this work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we are choosing a colour for the &quot;Buy now!&quot; button. The choices are orange, green, or white. We initialize all three choices to 1 win out of 1 try. It doesn't really matter what we initialize them too, because the algorithm will adapt. So when we start out, the internal test data looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/1 = 100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/1=100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/1=100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a web site visitor comes along and we have to show them a button. We choose the first one with the highest expectation of winning. The algorithm thinks they all work 100% of the time, so it chooses the first one: orange. But, alas, the visitor doesn't click on the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/2 = 50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/1=100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/1=100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another visitor comes along. We definitely won't show them orange, since we think it only has a 50% chance of working. So we choose Green. They don't click. The same thing happens for several more visitors, and we end up cycling through the choices. In the process, we refine our estimate of the click through rate for each option downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/4 = 25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;But suddenly, someone clicks on the orange button! Quickly, the browser makes an Ajax call to our reward function &lt;code&gt;$.ajax(url:&quot;/reward?testname=buy-button&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; and our code updates the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2/5 = 40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our intrepid web developer sees this, he scratches his head. What the F*? The orange button is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; choice. Its font is tiny! The green button is obviously the better one. All is lost! The greedy algorithm will always choose it forever now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, let's see what happens if Orange is really the suboptimal choice. Since the algorithm now believes it is the best, it will always be shown. That is, until it stops working well. Then the other choices start to look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2/9 = 22%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1/4=25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many more visits, the best choice, if there is one, will have been found, and will be shown 90% of the time. Here are some results based on an actual web site that I have been working on. We also have an estimate of the click through rate for each choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Orange&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Green&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;White&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;114/4071 = 2.8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;205/6385=3.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;59/2264=2.6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Edit: What about the randomization?&lt;/h3&gt;
I have not discussed the randomization part. The randomization of 10% of trials forces the algorithm to explore the options. It is a trade-off between trying new things in hopes of something better, and sticking with what it knows will work. There are several variations of the epsilon-greedy strategy. In the epsilon-first strategy, you can explore 100% of the time in the beginning and once you have a good sample, switch to pure-greedy. Alternatively, you can have it decrease the amount of exploration as time passes. The epsilon-greedy strategy that I have described is a good balance between simplicity and performance. Learning about the other algorithms, such as UCB, Boltzmann Exploration, and methods that take context into account, is fascinating, but optional if you just want something that works.
&lt;h2&gt;Wait a minute, why isn't everybody doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
Statistics are hard for most people to understand. People distrust things that they do not understand, and they especially distrust machine learning algorithms, even if they are simple. Mainstream tools don't support this, because then you'd have to educate people about it, and about statistics, and that is hard. Some common objections might be:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showing the different options at different rates will skew the results. (No it won't. You always have an estimate of the click through rate for each choice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This won't adapt to change. (Your visitors probably don't change. But if you really want to, in the reward function, multiply the old reward value by a forgetting factor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This won't handle changing several things at once that depend on each-other. (Agreed. Neither will A/B testing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won't know what the click is worth for 30 days so how can I reward it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More blog entries&lt;/h2&gt;

rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoIsGooglesLanguage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the link.  There is clearly a real sense in which Go is&lt;br /&gt;Google's language.  But I think I would like to emphasize some points&lt;br /&gt;that don't necessarily contradict the blog post but may add some&lt;br /&gt;nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a member of the Go team and I'm employed by Google.  I'm speaking&lt;br /&gt;exclusively for myself here, not for Google nor for the Go team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've worked on free software for my entire career, before I joined&lt;br /&gt;Google and indeed before Google existed.  I think it's fair to say&lt;br /&gt;that Go is an open source language.  All the source code, including&lt;br /&gt;the source code for all the infrastructure support, is freely&lt;br /&gt;available and may be reused and changed by anyone.  For software the&lt;br /&gt;most fundamental freedom is freedom to fork: freedom to take an&lt;br /&gt;existing project in a new direction.  People have that freedom with&lt;br /&gt;the Go language.  They don't necessarily have the freedom to call that&lt;br /&gt;forked language &quot;Go&quot; (I'm not sure), but I think that limitation is&lt;br /&gt;OK; it serves nobody to call different projects by the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog post starts by quoting @kapoorsunny asking why there can't be&lt;br /&gt;something like OpenGo, with a community implementation of generics.  I&lt;br /&gt;hope that it is clear that the answer is that there could be.  Nothing&lt;br /&gt;prevents that from happening.  In particular, Google doesn't prevent&lt;br /&gt;that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when someone says that Go is Google's language, they must mean&lt;br /&gt;something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any free software project, there is a set of people who can commit&lt;br /&gt;changes to the project.  For the Go project, that is the set of people&lt;br /&gt;who are on the approvers list, who can click the +2 button in Gerrit.&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this list is publicly visible for anybody is not an&lt;br /&gt;approver, but I just took a look.  Since some people who work at&lt;br /&gt;Google use their personal e-mail addresses I could have made a&lt;br /&gt;mistake, but I count 59 Googlers on the committers list and 51&lt;br /&gt;non-Googlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Google is the majority, it's not an overwhelming one.  Again,&lt;br /&gt;this can't be what it means to say that Go is Google's language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A programming language is a type of shared software infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;It's most useful when everybody is using the same language, so code&lt;br /&gt;written by person A can be reused by person B.  That means that&lt;br /&gt;programming languages are most useful when we all agree on exactly&lt;br /&gt;what the language is.  All successful languages have either a single&lt;br /&gt;specification or a single primary implementation.  (Go and C++ are&lt;br /&gt;examples of language based on a specification; Perl, at least before&lt;br /&gt;Perl 6, is an example of a language based on an implementation).&lt;br /&gt;These serve as the definition of what the language is: whatever the&lt;br /&gt;specification says or whatever the implementation does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most people would agree to all of the above.  Now some&lt;br /&gt;opinion, where people may disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a language is to change over time, this specification or&lt;br /&gt;implementation must change.  Somebody has to decide how changes will&lt;br /&gt;be made.  All successful languages have a small set of people who make&lt;br /&gt;the final decisions.  Many people will provide input to this decision,&lt;br /&gt;but no successful language--indeed, no successful free software&lt;br /&gt;project of any sort--is a democracy.  Successful languages pay&lt;br /&gt;attention to what people want, but to change the language according to&lt;br /&gt;what most people want is, I believe, a recipe for chaos and&lt;br /&gt;incoherence.  I believe that every successful language must have a&lt;br /&gt;coherent vision that is shared by a relatively small group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said, that is my opinion, but I think it's true.  I would be&lt;br /&gt;interested to hear of a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Go is a successful language, and hopes to remain successful, it&lt;br /&gt;too must be open to community input but must have a small number of&lt;br /&gt;people who make final decisions about how the language will change&lt;br /&gt;over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I think that when the blog post says that Go is Google's language,&lt;br /&gt;what they mean is that Google makes those final decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a bit of personal history.  The Go project was started, by Rob,&lt;br /&gt;Robert, and Ken, as a bottom-up project.  I joined the project some 9&lt;br /&gt;months later, on my own initiative, against my manager's preference.&lt;br /&gt;There was no mandate or suggestion from Google management or&lt;br /&gt;executives that Google should develop a programming language.  For&lt;br /&gt;many years, including well after the open source release, I doubt any&lt;br /&gt;Google executives had more than a vague awareness of the existence of&lt;br /&gt;Go (I recall a time when Google's SVP of Engineering saw some of us in&lt;br /&gt;the cafeteria and congratulated us on a release; this was surprising&lt;br /&gt;since we hadn't released anything recently, and it soon came up that&lt;br /&gt;he thought we were working on the Dart language, not the Go language.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Go was developed by people who worked at Google, it is&lt;br /&gt;inevitable that the people who initially developed Go, who became the&lt;br /&gt;core Go team, were Google employees.  And it happens that of that core&lt;br /&gt;Go team, while not all are actively working on Go, none have left&lt;br /&gt;Google for another company in the years since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think that due to Go's success there are now Google executives&lt;br /&gt;who know about Go.  Google as a company is doing more work with Go at&lt;br /&gt;a higher level, supporting efforts like the Go Cloud Development Kit&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/go-cloud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/google/go-cloud&lt;/a&gt;).  And, of course, Go is a&lt;br /&gt;significant supporting element for major Google Cloud projects like&lt;br /&gt;Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But (and here you'll just have to trust me) those executives, and&lt;br /&gt;upper management in general, have never made any attempt to affect how&lt;br /&gt;the Go language and tools and standard library are developed.  Of&lt;br /&gt;course, there's no reason for them to.  Go is doing fine, so why&lt;br /&gt;should they interfere?  And what could they gain if they did&lt;br /&gt;interfere?  So they leave us alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, the current state is what the blog post suggests at&lt;br /&gt;the very end: final decisions about the Go language are made by the&lt;br /&gt;core Go team, and the core Go team all work at Google, but there is no&lt;br /&gt;meaningful sense in which Google, apart from the core Go team, makes&lt;br /&gt;decisions about the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think that it will be interesting to see what happens if someone&lt;br /&gt;on the core Go team decides to leave Google and but wants to continue&lt;br /&gt;working on Go.  And it will be interesting to see what the core Go&lt;br /&gt;team, including me, decides to do about succession planning as time&lt;br /&gt;goes on.  Being a core Go team member is a full time job, and many&lt;br /&gt;people who want to work on Go full time wind up being hired by Google,&lt;br /&gt;so it would not be particularly surprising if the core Go team&lt;br /&gt;continues to be primarily or exclusively Google employees.  But even&lt;br /&gt;then it's not clear that Go will be Google's language in any deep&lt;br /&gt;sense.  It's also possible that someday it will become appropriate to&lt;br /&gt;create some sort of separate Go Foundation to manage the language.  I&lt;br /&gt;don't know.  We'll have to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said initially, none of this necessarily contradicts anything in&lt;br /&gt;the blog post, but perhaps it gives a slightly different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this note I've specifically focused on whether Go is Google's&lt;br /&gt;language.  I have some thoughts on other aspects of the blog post,&lt;br /&gt;about its discussion of the interaction between the core Go team and&lt;br /&gt;the rest of the Go community, but this note is already too long.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I will tackle those later.  Or perhaps not, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Why We’re Switching to gRPC</title>
<link>https://eng.fromatob.com/post/2019/05/why-were-switching-to-grpc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://eng.fromatob.com/post/2019/05/why-were-switching-to-grpc/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When you use a microservice-style architecture, one pretty fundamental decision you need to make is: how do your services talk to each other? The default choice seems to be to send JSON over HTTP – using so-called REST APIs, although most people don’t quite take the REST principles seriously. At fromAtoB, this is how we started, but more recently we decided to make gRPC our standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grpc.io/&quot;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; is a system for remote procedure calls that was developed at Google and is now open-source. Although it’s been around for several years, I haven’t found much online about why people are or aren’t using it, so I decided to write an article explaining our reasons for using gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious advantage of gRPC is that it uses an efficient binary encoding, which can make it faster than JSON/HTTP. While more speed is always welcome, there are two aspects that were more important for us: clear interface specifications and support for streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;grpc-interface-specifications&quot;&gt;gRPC interface specifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a new gRPC service, the first step is always to define the interface in a &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file. The code below shows what that looks like – it’s a simplified version of a small part of our own API. The example defines a single remote procedure call “Lookup” and types for its input and output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-proto&quot; data-lang=&quot;proto&quot;&gt;syntax &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;proto3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; fromatob;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;// FromAtoB is a simplified version of fromAtoB’s backend API.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; FromAtoB {&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;rpc&lt;/span&gt; Lookup(LookupRequest) &lt;span&gt;returns&lt;/span&gt; (Coordinate) {}&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;// A LookupRequest is a request to look up the coordinates for a city by name.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;LookupRequest&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;// A Coordinate identifies a location on Earth by latitude and longitude.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Coordinate&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;// Latitude is the degrees latitude of the location, in the range [-90, 90].
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; latitude &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;// Longitude is the degrees longitude of the location, in the range [-180, 180].
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; longitude &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this file, you can then generate client and server code using the &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; compiler, and you can start writing code that provides or consumes the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why is this a good thing, and not just extra work? Take another look at the code sample above. Even if you’ve never used gRPC or Protocol Buffers, it’s pretty readable: for example, it’s clear that to make a &lt;code&gt;Lookup&lt;/code&gt; request you should send a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, which is a string, and you’ll get back a &lt;code&gt;Coordinate&lt;/code&gt;, which consists of &lt;code&gt;latitude&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longitude&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, once you’ve added some simple comments, like in the example, the &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file is the API documentation for your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification for a real service can be much bigger, of course, but it won’t be much more complicated. It’ll just be more &lt;code&gt;rpc&lt;/code&gt; statements for methods and &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; statements for data types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code generated by &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; will also make sure that data sent by client or server corresponds to the specification. This can be a huge help for debugging. I remember two instances where the service I was working on generated JSON data in the wrong format and because that format wasn’t validated anywhere, the problem only showed up in the user interface. The only way to find out what went wrong was to debug the JavaScript frontend code – not so easy when you’re a backend developer who’s never used the JavaScript framework used in the frontend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;swagger-openapi&quot;&gt;Swagger / OpenAPI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, you can get the same advantages for HTTP/JSON APIs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://swagger.io/&quot;&gt;Swagger&lt;/a&gt; or its successor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openapis.org/&quot;&gt;OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an example equivalent to the gRPC API above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;openapi: &lt;span&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

info:
  title: A simplified version of fromAtoB’s backend API
  version: &lt;span&gt;'1.0'&lt;/span&gt;

paths:
  /lookup:
    get:
      description: Look up the coordinates for a city by name.
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: name
          schema:
            type: string
          description: City name.
      responses:
        &lt;span&gt;'200'&lt;/span&gt;:
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: &lt;span&gt;'#/components/schemas/Coordinate'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;'404'&lt;/span&gt;:
          description: Not Found
          content:
            text/plain:
              schema:
                type: string

components:
  schemas:
    Coordinate:
      type: object
      description: A Coordinate identifies a location on Earth by latitude and longitude.
      properties:
        latitude:
          type: number
          description: Latitude is the degrees latitude of the location, in the range [-&lt;span&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;].
        longitude:
          type: number
          description: Longitude is the degrees longitude of the location, in the range [-&lt;span&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the gRPC spec above. The OpenAPI one is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder to read! It’s more verbose and has a much more complicated structure (eight levels of indentation instead of one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an OpenAPI spec for validation is also more difficult than with gRPC. At least for internal services, this all means specs either don’t get written, or they don’t get updated and become useless as the API evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;streaming&quot;&gt;Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I started designing a new API for our searches (think “give me all connections from Berlin to Paris on 1 June 2019”). After I built a first version of the API with HTTP and JSON, one of my colleagues pointed out that in some cases we needed to stream results, meaning we should start sending the first results as soon as we got them. My API just returned a single JSON array, so the server couldn’t send anything until it had collected all results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do in the API used by the frontends is to have clients poll for results. They send a POST request to set up the search, then send repeated GET requests to retrieve results. The response includes a field that indicate if the search is complete or not. This works fine, but it’s not very elegant, and it requires the server to use a datastore such as Redis to keep intermediate results. The new API would be implemented by multiple smaller services and I didn’t want to force all of them to implement this logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when we decided to try out gRPC. To send the results of a remote procedure call with gRPC, you just add the &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; keyword in the &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file. Here’s the definition for our &lt;code&gt;Search&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-proto&quot; data-lang=&quot;proto&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rpc&lt;/span&gt; Search (SearchRequest) &lt;span&gt;returns&lt;/span&gt; (stream Trip) {}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code generated by the &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; compiler includes an object with a &lt;code&gt;Send&lt;/code&gt; function that our server code calls to send &lt;code&gt;Trip&lt;/code&gt; objects one-by-one, and an object with a &lt;code&gt;Recv&lt;/code&gt; function that the client code calls to retrieve them. From the programmer’s point of view, this is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier than implementing a polling API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of downsides of gRPC that I want to mention. Both of them have to do with tooling, rather than the protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you build an API with HTTP/JSON, you can use curl, httpie or Postman for simple manual testing. There is a similar tool for gRPC called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl&quot;&gt;grpcurl&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not quite as seamless: you have to either add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md&quot;&gt;gRPC server reflection&lt;/a&gt; extension on the server side or specify the &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file on every command. We’ve found it more convenient to include a small command-line utility with the server that lets you make simple requests. The client code generated by &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; actually makes that pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bigger issue for us was that the Kubernetes load balancer, which we’re using for our HTTP service, doesn’t work well for gRPC. Basically, gRCP requires load balancing at the application level rather than at the level of TCP connections. To solve this, we set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkerd.io/&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;/a&gt; following this tutorial: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/11/07/grpc-load-balancing-on-kubernetes-without-tears/&quot;&gt;gRPC Load Balancing on Kubernetes without Tears&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although building gRPC APIs requires a bit more work upfront, we found that having clear API specifications and good support for streaming more than makes up for that. For us, gRPC is going to be the default option for any new internal service we build.&lt;/p&gt;
