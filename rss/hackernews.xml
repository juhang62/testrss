<title>MailChimp deleted my account with no warning or notification</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rongarret.info/2018/12/mailchimp-deleted-my-account-with-no.html</guid>
<description>I make and sell a security product called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sc4.us/hsm/index.html&quot;&gt;SC4-HSM&lt;/a&gt; which, among other things, acts as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/&quot;&gt;FIDO U2F key&lt;/a&gt;.  A few days ago I was contacted by an independent security researcher named Christian Reitter saying that he had discovered a security flaw that impacted a wide range of such keys.  It turned out that the SC4-HSM is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; impacted by the flaw, so I waited for the information embargo period to end and went to send out a notice to my mailing list letting my customers know all was well and they didn't need to worry.  I keep my mailing list on MailChimp.  I don't use the account very often, but every time I have used it I have had no problems.&lt;p&gt;Today, however, when I went to log in to my account, I was met with the following message:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This account has been deactivated. To continue using Mailchimp, please create a new account with a new username. If you have questions, please contact compliance@mailchimp.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I went to my web site to see what a customer would experience if they tried to sign up for my list, and the result was the most unhelpful error message I have ever seen on the web (and that's saying something):&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ojf-0w0gA6Y/XBhPzyaga3I/AAAAAAAABWs/o7kZ24ReSj4jJRa-FeCLW5bI_ggrbIhCgCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/Untitled.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ojf-0w0gA6Y/XBhPzyaga3I/AAAAAAAABWs/o7kZ24ReSj4jJRa-FeCLW5bI_ggrbIhCgCK4BGAYYCw/s400/Untitled.png&quot; width=&quot;322&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Remember, this is what one of &lt;em&gt;my prospective customers&lt;/em&gt; would see.  Such a person may or may not have a MailChimp account, most likely not, so what would be the point of going to a dashboard?  Assuming that button actually took you to a dashboard.  Which it doesn't.)&lt;p&gt;I was shocked.  As I said, I don't use my account very much, but I know it was active as of November 26 (three weeks ago) because someone signed up for my mailing list that week and I received a notification about that.  I went back through my mail archives to see if a warning or notification about this had gotten spam-filtered somehow.  Nope.  Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the situation is this: MailChimp shut down my account without even &lt;em&gt;notifying&lt;/em&gt; me, let alone warning me that this was about to happen.  At the same time, they turned the link on my site that prospective customers use to sign up for my mailing list into a dead link, and cut off my access to the existing list so I can no longer contact my existing customers.  The only way to contact MailChimp is by email (they don't have a phone number AFAICT).  I sent them an inquiry about this but they have not responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if all that were not bad enough, there appears on the face of it to be no way to re-activate my account.  The only option given in the error message is  &quot;To continue using Mailchimp, please create a new account with a new username.&quot;  If I take this error message at face value, my mailing list is gone forever.  WTAF MailChimp?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't like to resort to public shaming, but this really is unacceptable.  Even if I do manage to get my account and/or mailing list back somehow, I don't see how I can ever rely on MailChimp for anything mission critical.  Pulling the rug out from under me like this is something you only get to do once.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Writing copy for landing pages</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/landing-page-copy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/landing-page-copy</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there’s the landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s often a company’s first impression: a digital introduction to an organization, the problem it tackles, and the solutions it offers. The sophistication of landing pages can vary. Some companies use their homepage as a landing page. Others create specific pages that target discrete customer profiles and move them through a marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing pages also take various forms depending on the growth stage of a company. But that’s one of the common missteps that I see: landing pages prioritize the story of the startup, rather than the journey &lt;em&gt;of the customer&lt;/em&gt; with the startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing page copy improves the more customers see themselves in it. Rethink and revise your landing page by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/landing-page-copy#the-foundational-elements-of-effective-landing-page-copy&quot;&gt;building it around three elements&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s too much effort and you’re looking for fast fixes, the following tips will improve your current landing page copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus copy on them.&lt;/strong&gt; Landing pages often say “we offer” or “our solution,” which focuses on the wrong thing—your company, not your customers. Go through each sentence in your copy and rewrite it to address your customers. One way to do this is to begin with the word “you.” Another tip is to start your sentence with a verb. Focusing on them nearly guarantees that your copy will address—and speak to—your visitor. Here’s a good example of what this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/modern_fertility.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;modern fertility screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only possible exception to leading with “you” in your copy is if you’re a service business, where prospects want to see what you do differently as a service provider. That’s often expressed as “we” language. But it doesn’t have to be. It just very often is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add pattern, texture, and shine to a block of copy.&lt;/strong&gt; Accurate, succinct, and grammatically correct copy can still feel flat. Patterns, texture, and shine can add another dimension to your copy, making it more engaging and memorable. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9.354435483871&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply a pattern to a sentence.&lt;/strong&gt; Patterns may be used to subtly reference a logo or map out a theme. Take a logistics company that transports goods by railway. Perhaps it not only wants to deliver a message, but also simulate a train with a pattern of evenly spaced dots in a horizontal line. To mimic that visual, rewrite landing page copy to link only words of similar length, such as three- or four-letter words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vary sentence length and formatting to create texture.&lt;/strong&gt; Texture can make copy feel more conversational, natural, and engaging. To create texture, write a smooth, polished sentence and juxtapose it with a more staccato sentence. Throw in some short sentences. More. More. And maybe one more. And then add a sentence that goes a lot longer, using clauses to lure your reader along. Then stop. The result? Texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.81598062954&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include a glossy word or two for shine.&lt;/strong&gt; Polish might mean swapping in a few new words. Find a bland word in your copy, and replace it with a more dazzling synonym. Take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collectiveretreats.com/&quot;&gt;Collective Retreats&lt;/a&gt; landing page copy below. Instead of “Find destinations without losing luxury,” try “Explore extraordinary destinations without sacrificing luxury.” The bright adjective and stronger verbs adds punch to the copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/collective_retreats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;collective retreats screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defang objections with an “even if” clause.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can anticipate what might keep someone from believing your claim or assertion, undercut that opposition by acknowledging it. It’ll hint that you understand their fear, uncertainty, and doubt—and suggest that your solution takes those considerations into account. The formula is simple: “[Claim] even if [objection].” A very simple example is: “Be creative even if you’re not creative.” Here’s an “even if” clause in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/woorank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;woorank screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit each sentence to one idea.&lt;/strong&gt; Sentences have the capacity to carry a lot of information, but your reader cannot. Your readers depend on periods, question marks, and even exclamation marks to give their brains a short rest—just enough of a reprieve to absorb information before moving on. The more you help readers with information digestion, the more appetite they’ll have to read on. So edit every sentence to have just one thought. Not two. Not three. Apple is skilled at this technique, but even it has opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/apple_tv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;apple tv screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take its copy for Apple TV 4K. Most of the sentences don’t qualify as sentences, but they absolutely follow the rule. Here’s the one that doesn’t: “Apple TV 4K lets you watch movies and shows in amazing 4K HDR—and now it completes the picture with immersive sound from Dolby Atmos.” This sentence merges two distinct features. The average reader would be better able to take in the information if that sentence was broken in two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Apple TV 4K lets you watch movies and shows in amazing 4K HDR. It’s got immersive sound from Dolby Atmos. Streams your favorite channels live. Has great content from apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and ESPN. And thanks to Siri, you can control it all with just your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a landing page that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your homepage.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve recently created a website for your company, your landing page might be your homepage, but they’re two different creatures. A landing page is designed to convert prospects into customers. It speaks to visitors looking for something specific, features content relevant to that particular item, and contains a call-to-action customized to that precise offering. On the other hand, a homepage serves a broad audience, features widely-relevant content, and may not have an immediate CTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated companies will route visitors who, say, search for products for large companies to a page geared toward enterprises rather than a homepage with general information. If you have a website with more than one page—or a more advanced information architecture and sitemap—consider linking to the page on your site that best addresses a visitor’s intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the spoiler: landing page copy is never done. Like your company, it will—and should—evolve over time. It’s an iterative process, and can always be improved. There are hundreds of copywriting formulas (many of them documented &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that can help you craft a headline, draft bullets, or structure a CTA. But if you don’t have the fundamentals down, the improvement will be incremental, not game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy for a high-performing landing page has three foundational qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It delivers a convincing first impression for the startup.&lt;/strong&gt; At a fundamental level, this involves direct, specific, and grammatically-correct copy. That level of precision and professionalism sets expectations and raises the bar for future engagements with a company’s product and team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It considers the maturity of the market.&lt;/strong&gt; Every market—like every company—is in its own stage of development. Companies in highly mature markets can use short copy, because most visitors already get the ins-and-outs of the solution or category (e.g. disposable razors). Their focus should be on product differentiators, the brand story, and who’s using it. If a market is still emerging (e.g. cryptocurrency in 2018) customers likely need more information, because a company is not only educating about its solution, but also helping define the category more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It reflects the customer’s stage of awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective landing page copy mirrors customer comprehension, which is layered and includes: how well a customer understands the challenge the company addresses (e.g. data privacy), what’s at stake (e.g. personal data and/or compliance), the changing landscape (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/guides/general-data-protection-regulation&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;), and tools that help (e.g. a specific product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, great copy demonstrates that a company grasps how aware customers are of the market, its pain points, and potential solutions. The best copy does all that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; signals that the company is clued into precisely how aware the customers are of &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;. Here are the five stages of awareness for any visitor to your landing page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors totally understand your solution and likely believe it’s a top contender for them. They just needs nudging. Purchases happen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are learning about your product. Free trials, demos, and purchases happen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are considering solutions to their pain or problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are feeling pain or dealing with a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unaware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors haven’t experienced a need that would drive them to your solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landing page copy reflects the customer if you can answer “yes” to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the language accessible and does it mirror a visitor’s stage of awareness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the copy move them from where they are to where they want to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are visitors prompted to take action once they become Product-aware or Most aware?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every landing page should &lt;strong&gt;deliver a convincing first impression, consider the maturity of the market,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reflect the customer’s stage of awareness&lt;/strong&gt;. The best way to see how the absence or presence of these elements alter a landing page is to review real-life examples. So, with the three foundational elements in mind, I’ve evaluated the landing pages of nine companies—from member management software to a vegan candy brand to a court date notification service. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impression-make-an-accurate-trust-building-and-lasting-introduction&quot;&gt;First impression: make an accurate, trust-building, and lasting introduction.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com&quot;&gt;Kapwing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does&lt;/strong&gt;: Modern editor for videos, GIFs, and images&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Copy that’s short, but vague&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply&lt;/strong&gt;: Get specific—but, first, scroll down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/kapwing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kapwing screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline—”Creativity made easy”— raises this question: Are people who’d use this solution &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; creative? The phrase suggests that it’s hard for your audience to be creative. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page falls victim to the myth that copy must be kept short at all costs. Many startups write three- or four-word headlines that try to say everything. It reduces the elevator pitch to a hiccup. Along the way, we tell ourselves we’re being succinct because we understand that being succinct is good when it comes to communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are you being succinct or are you being vague? Worse, are you sacrificing a clear message for a short one? Your headline is prime real estate. Let it do some real work—it’s made for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back to your last ten conversations with a customer or prospect. (If you haven’t had at least ten, &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/2018/05/how-to-listen/&quot;&gt;do that first&lt;/a&gt;.) At what point in the conversation did they perk up? That’s the fodder for a good headline—at least one that’s worth testing. That’s what should top your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With headlines, don’t take rich, nuanced feedback from customers and whittle it down to the smallest possible version. Instead listen. Write down what you hear. And put it on the page. You’ll clean it up so it’s on brand and persuasive, but it shouldn’t be boiled down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern in boiling it down is that you’ll get too vague. Kapwing’s tools run the gamut. They make memes, add subtitles to video, create montages and more. If you’re the marketing team, the temptation is to look at everything Kapwing does, plot it in a Venn diagram, and promote the overlapping part: the quality that all features, uses cases and outputs have in common. That’s likely how “Creativity made easy” emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how mediocre headlines surface—and it happens surprisingly often, even to the most copy-savvy startups. Many founders use more effective headlines in their verbal elevator pitches or elsewhere in copy. That’s the case for Kapwing; the better options for a headline are further down in the copy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks that take hours in iMovie take minutes in Kapwing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No install. No passwords. No technical tutorials. It works on every OS, on your phone, and your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring on the memes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creative jobs that take hours in iMovie take just minutes in Kapwing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either copy expresses the ease of being creative in Kapwing in a specific, compelling way—and serve as entry points to its other suite of tools. These messages should lead the page as a headline. Hidden headline copy happens to many businesses. It’s not that companies can’t generate good headlines; they’ve likely just buried them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webgazer.io/&quot;&gt;WebGazer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Free website monitoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; We-focused copy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The Rule of You&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This headline works, as long as visitors arrive on the page knowing what WebGazer is and does. The copy might suffice if this is a retargeting page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if it’s not? Let’s start with the phrase: “We help you keep your business running.” The very first word (“we”) is a problem. We-focused copy is an issue—almost without fail. It communicates from the perspective of the company, not the customer. It’s the equivalent of a person introducing themselves and dominating the airspace with their story. Correct “we-focused” copy by rewriting every sentence to begin with the word “you” or a verb. Here’s how WebGazer can change three sentences on its landing page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;We-focused copy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;You-focused copy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;We monitor your sites without a rest, see what we have done today yourself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You can rest easy. Because we’ll monitor your site without rest.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;WebGazer checks if your website is up as it should be and notifies you if anything goes wrong.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Keep your online business running without interruption. WebGazer monitors it night and day. And notifies you if anything goes wrong.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;We help you keep your business running.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How would you know if your website was suddenly down?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influencekit.com/&quot;&gt;InfluenceKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Automated reporting for sponsored content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; A timely call to action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/#AIDA)[%20framework](https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/#AIDA&quot;&gt;AIDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/influence_kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;influence kit screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first impression is how much is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; with this landing page copy. It reads well and follows some of the strongest copywriting better practices, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing distracting calls to action (e.g. no global navigation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooking visitors immediately with a highly desirable benefit (why they should care)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding on the benefit with product-specific support (how the product does it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formatting copy for maximum readability (the three paragraphs of body copy under “You have a blog?” is a manageable column to read instead of spanning the width of the page, which is extremely fatiguing for the reading eye.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a voice that is present but not overwhelming (With few exceptions, they’ve used their voice in crossheads only, minimizing ‘interruptions’ in how readers process information.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading with “you” wherever possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sentences short, and easy to consume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landing point copy has done so much right—the challenge is that it hasn’t cashed in on it. After making a convincing argument to the prospect, it forgets to end with a CTA. The AIDA framework can help outline this progression and missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab their attention&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, InfluenceKit starts to build trust and empathy by clearly articulating the problem many bloggers face: demonstrating value from content. The copy reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;...it’s really hard proving to brands how much value you’re delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build up their interest in the subject&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, the copy deepens that understanding by elaborating on the problem, causing readers to nod along and more fully recognize themselves in the challenge. This shared understanding builds further interest. The copy continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Yes, it’s about the content, but it’s also about knowing how many lives were impacted by what you created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;We all like to know where our money's going (dang you Target!!). Brands are just like us; they want to know what they're getting for their investment. Reporting impressions is the industry standard for internet marketing, and up until now, bloggers have been a black hole of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Your blog is more than just pretty pictures, you have real influence. You know it, and we know it, and together we’re going to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn that casual interest into a direct desire&lt;/strong&gt; for them to add the solution to their lives. The solution that’s offered is succinct and clear. The copy reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Show Your Real Influence with Powerful and Dynamic Reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call them to action.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a CTA, but it’s in the wrong place. It’s buried beneath a list of integrations, the four-step process to set-up InfluenceKit, an infographic on the two types of bloggers, and a Meet-the-Team section. Finally, there’s a call to action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Ready to Prove Your Value &amp;amp; Make More Money? Request Access Now. (Secret handshake to follow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy has sufficiently made a case for action by the end of the four-part “How Does InfluenceKit Work?” section. Here, I’d expect—and encourage—a &lt;em&gt;closer&lt;/em&gt; section, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A restatement of the value prop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick bullet list of results generated by the solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CTA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A testimonial from a blogger or sponsor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data point about average results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps InfluenceKit is a newer company, which is why there’s no data yet for how it’s paying off. But there’s power in being new. I’d suggest the founders share their own story and results thanks to InfluenceKit—being transparent all along that they’re the founders—to demonstrate that others can also benefit. Part of making a lasting first impression is creating a window for not only a prospect to relate, but act, and interact. That turns an impression into a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nombacandies.com/&quot;&gt;Nomba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital-first vegan candy brand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The model to try or demo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; Map your market over your first customer engagement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/nomba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nomba screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Try Now” language at the top of the landing page—and throughout the site—is confusing. But what’s more puzzling is the idea of a trial for this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the mainstream consumer, trials are not typical in the world of buying candy. By offering a trial, you’ve effectively taken a super-sophisticated market of buyers—people who’ve bought candy, understand buying candy, and just wanna get vegan candy—and introduced doubt. Suddenly visitors are asking small questions that escalate into bigger concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does a trial mean in the world of candy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try food that’s shipped to me? Do I ship it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I get a sample or a full-sized product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Is this a subscription I’ll have to work to get out of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; spicy candy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like that, they’re gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your visitors go from wanting to give this spicy vegan candy a shot to hitting the back button and feeling relief that they got out of there as quickly as they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomba’s copy has a new challenge: it needs to deal with the “problem” of prospective customers not understanding the trial model for a food item. Here’s how it can do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, know that you have to address the problem.&lt;/strong&gt; But you &lt;em&gt;do not have to go into great detail&lt;/em&gt; to address it. After all, this is a $5 treat or $15 investment in sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, ask: what’s the easiest, quickest way is to address the problem?&lt;/strong&gt; Often, it’s in naming. Sometimes product features are better explained by renaming them and pricing tiers are better explained by re-labeling each tier. In this case, the &lt;em&gt;trial&lt;/em&gt; may be better grokked by renaming it to &lt;em&gt;sample pack&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sampler&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the “Try Now” CTA could become any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the Sampler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample Nomba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomba should keep that new language consistent throughout each product page and checkout to avoid further confusion. Any startup that offers demos or trials to win customers should craft their copy with not only their customer, but their existing market in mind. The market part of product/market fit also matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://eve.io/&quot;&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does&lt;/strong&gt;: Event management software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Overemphasis on the solution, not the problem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/#PAS&quot;&gt;PAS framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/eve.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;eve screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospects for event management software may already recognize the need for a solution, but if not, this landing page needs more education on the challenges of planning events. After all, there’s a lot of complexity in running events: multiple stakeholders, shifting timelines, numerous vendors, and changing agendas. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landing page starts out relatively strong with a benefit-driven headline and a product-level value proposition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;The easier way to plan events.&lt;br/&gt;Eve allows your entire team to plan, execute and review your events, all in one place — without changing your existing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading with a value proposition is the standard choice for SaaS companies. That’s fine, but a lot of marketers struggle with what should go next on the page. For a product like eve—where it’s easy for the prospect and the whole world to minimize the pain of event planning until you’re two days away from the event and panicking—I’d recommend moving swiftly from discussing the value prop to outlining and fleshing out the problem eve solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like that’s accomplished with the first crosshead under the hero:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Easy software to end event stress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that crosshead leads with the solution (“easy software”) when it ought to focus entirely on the pain (“event stress”). The PAS—or Problem, Agitation, Solution—framework helps lay out copy in a way that it zeroes in on the driving force behind choosing a painkiller solution like eve: the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest advice is choosing copy that doesn’t glide over that pain. So swap this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;&quot;How hard could it be to plan and coordinate a live event?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;&quot;How hard could it be to plan and coordinate a two-day conference with 20 speakers from around the globe and 500 attendees?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first option is safe. The second option is sticky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often we try to boil everything down to its safest version. And we sacrifice specific, sticky copy that might actually hook and convert actual prospects. It’s not our fault. Everyone we know is writing safe copy. If we go bold, we’re taking a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test it and see, but my encouragement is to go for it. Rare is the business that makes waves today without either 1) a huge marketing budget to overcome their safe messaging or 2) a memorable way of connecting with people. Endeavor to be uncomfortably specific with your prospects. It shows you’re in touch with the precise pain felt by the professionals in your market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/scribendi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scribendi screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the copy on this page is strong. But copy is not always words, but numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the page, there is some impressive proof of impact on clients served, words proofread and editors in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/scribendi_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scribendi2 screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are striking figures, but they also come with complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’m sure I’m not the only person who misread 1.6B as 1.6M. That sounds like a lot, but how many documents does that mean? Is it 10,000+ ESL papers for academics or 100,000 essays for undergraduates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest keeping the data as is, but adding in a visual that shows the scale of the achievement. Here’s one way to back into a compelling visual via a quick calculation: 1.6B words is actually 6.4M pages. That’s 318,939 millimeters. That’s 1,046 feet. That’s amazing. That’s more than half the size of the CN Tower in Canada—or insert your local landmark relevant to your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help your prospects visualize the work you’ve done—and don’t be afraid to reference something &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; your market to make the case &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; your market. Numbers are good. But I believe the saying goes: whoever draws a picture wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;customer-awareness-map-your-customers-awareness&quot;&gt;Customer awareness: map your customers’ awareness.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinit.org/&quot;&gt;Join It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Member management software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Assumes visitor is solution-aware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; Shift to the mindset of a solution-aware prospect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/join_it.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;join it screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This headline—Membership Management Software—is great for search engine optimization (SEO), but it’s so technical that it’s jarring, especially as the first three bold words on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a headline like “Membership Management Software” to work, its prospects need to be sophisticated and “solution-aware.” Here’s where that stacks on the five stages of awareness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors totally understand your solution and likely believe it’s a top contender for them. They just need nudging. Purchases happen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are learning about your product. Free trials, demos and purchases happen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are considering solutions to their pain or problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are feeling pain or dealing with a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unaware.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors haven’t experienced a need that would drive them to your solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If prospects are solution-aware, they’re actively seeking “membership management software” and would easily call it that. However, Join It is eliminating a segment of prospects by only addressing solution-aware visitors. By finessing headlines and copy to match the &lt;em&gt;problems or state of mind&lt;/em&gt; of prospects, Join It can open its aperture to capture more potential customers. Here’s how that might look with tweaks to copy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Solution-aware prospect’s state of mind on arrival&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Corresponding headline copy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;I’ve heard that membership management software can help me automate all the community stuff I’m struggling with&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now You Can Automate Community Engagement with Easy Membership Management Software&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;I need membership management software that does this big list of stuff&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fast-Growing Organizations Need Membership Management Software That:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brings your community together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works intuitively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automates your tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scales as you grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;I’m thinking of switching from X membership management software, which I don’t like because of Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Put an End to Y with Easy Membership Management Software That Scales&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Should I be terrified of all the work that’s about to come when I introduce a membership management solution in my organization?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Membership management software&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Much Easier Would Growing Your Business Be If You Could &lt;strong&gt;Automate Your Community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shift from solution-aware language to the state-of-mind of a prospect may seem like you’re downshifting to a problem-aware visitor. This stage of visitor might seem further from a product-aware prospect, where a sale can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given the market maturity for membership management software, Join It will open its top-of-the-funnel to more prospects if it makes its headline more accessible to more visitors. And it’ll still be relatable to solution-aware and product-aware prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://parkpnp.com/us/&quot;&gt;Parkpnp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Marketplace for unused or underutilized parking spaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorrect assumptions about the visitor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/#PAS&quot;&gt;The Rule of One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/park_pnp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;park pnp screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of customer awareness is understanding the context and drive for their visit—all of which should be reflected in the copy and experience of a page. That nuance can be the difference between a visitor identifying you as a hero in their lives—or a villain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Parkpnp, context and drive are pivotal factors for its solution. An app that allows you to find a parking space might be used in advance of an anticipated painful parking experience, such as major sporting events. But it’s more likely to be used in the heat of the moment, when the pain for a prospect is most visceral and distractions abound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, most people will use Parkpnp when they are driving their cars looking for a place to park in a busy area. Their pain is high. Their motivation to solve the pain is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your site a hero or a villain in that moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current hero section copy and experience sets up the solution to be more the villain than the hero. First, it puts work on the user’s plate by asking for an address—which holds true on both mobile and desktop. But perhaps more glaringly, it makes assumptions about what “perfect” means to the user. In fact, &lt;em&gt;perfect parking&lt;/em&gt; could mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s near where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s closest to my final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s available regularly / always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows overnight parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the cheapest option in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It accepts credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s patrolled by security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has extra-wide parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t require parallel parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s got special needs access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “perfect” is trying to cover all manner of desires in the headline for this page. But perfect for User A may not be perfect for User B. This is where the business needs to make a decision: What’s the primary prospect’s top definition of &lt;em&gt;perfect parking&lt;/em&gt; in the moment they use the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question gets to the heart of what copywriters call the Rule of One, which holds that you are always writing a landing page with the following four points identified first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all parts of the Rule of One, your One Reader is the most important. You can’t write an effective page without first identifying your One Reader. Once you know your One Reader well, you know what pains drive them, what benefits they’re looking for, what offer they’re most likely to respond best to, what kinds of social proof will move them—the list goes on. You do not have to get incredibly detailed on your One Reader, but you do have to know them well enough to look at the above list of definitions of &lt;em&gt;perfect parking&lt;/em&gt; and know which one they would choose if they could only choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one they would use is the one you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Parkpnp, if the One Reader defines &lt;em&gt;perfect parking&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;parking that’s near where I am now&lt;/em&gt;, the headline would change and so would the CTA. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th/&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Headline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FIND YOUR PERFECT PARKING SPACE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FIND AN AVAILABLE PARKING SPACE NEARBY NOW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Primary CTA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Field: Where would you like to park?&lt;br/&gt;Button: Find Parking&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Subordinate CTA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Button: Find Parking Nearby&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Link: Find Parking for a Future Date, Event, or Long-Term Need&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how your site goes from being a villain to being a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if your One Reader would define &lt;em&gt;perfect parking&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;parking near my work that doesn’t cost half my paycheck&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;safe parking for my daughter who’s away at college&lt;/em&gt;—that is, if they’re planning for future parking needs—the headline and experience would change accordingly, of course. You don’t have to get that specific. But if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get that specific in your headline, you’re more likely to convert your visitor. The alternative is writing a headline that serves a huge range of audiences. But, be forewarned: a hero to all is a boring character—and more likely to be ineffectual for the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecourtdate.com/&quot;&gt;eCourt Date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Timely, digital court date reminders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing Page Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Unclear who the user is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Ideal for&quot; statement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/atlas-guides/landing-page-copy-guide/e_court_date.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;e court date screenshot&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first—and most important—question about eCourt Date’s landing page: do people land on this page and know if the service is meant for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cleanest, easiest ways to optimize your copy is to use an “ideal for” statement. That statement can appear anywhere on your site, but it’s best that it appears closer to the top of your landing page. That’s especially true for a service like eCourt Date, where the user is unclear. It might be for lawyers, police officers, the court, defendants and plaintiffs—maybe even those serving jury duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever one it is, put that on the page in an ideal-for statement, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Ideal for lawyers with criminal and DUI cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s for more than one user, that’s fine. Put those names on the page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Ideal for criminal lawyers, traffic cops, and courthouse administrators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the headline and subhead in the hero have context and communicate the service more clearly. To enhance the copy, take a few extra steps. Answer why it matters and add proof that you’ve done it. This rule is known as “So What”/”Prove it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the copy might look with those two elements addressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indented-copy&quot;&gt;Ideal for busy courthouse administrators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send Court Date Reminders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Failure to Appear Rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notify defendants about court dates and other legal events. So you save up to 20 hours per month of court staff time. Reduce court no-shows by 33%. And humanize the defendant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolster this copy with testimonials from previously frustrated and now happy court staff or judges. These improvements all stem from articulating the ideal user for the service at the onset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landing page copy is an underleveraged, powerful tool. Done right, it builds brand, engenders trust, and sells product—to anyone with an internet connection, on their schedule. But it’s not automatic. Landing page copy must deliver a convincing first impression, consider the maturity of the market, and reflect the customer’s stage of awareness. It must meet prospects where they are and get them to where they—and the business—want them to be. Once it does, hand waves became high fives, and high fives turn into handshakes—and conversions can happen without much human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t overthink where you should start. Just get started. A landing page can—and must—always improve. If you have limited time and resources, run through &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/landing-page-copy#quick-wins-for-better-landing-page-copy&quot;&gt;the quick wins&lt;/a&gt; to make tweaks that generate outsized gains. If you have more time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/landing-page-copy#the-foundational-elements-of-effective-landing-page-copy&quot;&gt;revamp your copy&lt;/a&gt; to orient around making a lasting impression, the maturity of the market, and customer awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
A Southern California man has become the latest person to sue the federal government over what he says is an unconstitutional search of his phone at the Los Angeles International Airport.
&lt;p&gt;According to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5634603-Gov-Uscourts-Cacd-727665-1-0.html&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Haisam Elsharkawi had arrived at LAX on February 9, 2017 and was headed to Saudi Arabia to go on a &lt;em&gt;hajj&lt;/em&gt;, the Muslim religious pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clearing the security checkpoint, Elsharkawi, an American citizen, was pulled aside from the Turkish Airlines boarding line by a Customs and Border Protection officer, who began questioning him about how much cash he was carrying and where he was going. Elsharkawi complied with the officer’s inquiries and dutifully followed him to a nearby table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the questioning continued and became increasingly aggressive, Mr. Elsharkawi asked if there was a problem and whether he needed an attorney,&quot; the complaint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5634603-Gov-Uscourts-Cacd-727665-1-0.html#document/p20/a471633&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Officer Rivas then accused Mr. Elsharkawi of hiding something because of his request for an attorney.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, another agent, Officer Rodriguez, began searching Elsharkawi’s pockets and discovered his phone. Rodriguez asked Elsharkawi to unlock his phone, which he declined to do. He then also refused to answer further questions without having an attorney present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another officer told Elsharkawi that he was not under arrest and as such had no right to an attorney—at which point he asked to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Someone help”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that request was ignored, another agent, Officer Rivas, began rifling through Elsharkawi’s carry-on bag for a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5634603-Gov-Uscourts-Cacd-727665-1-0.html#document/p20/a471633&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Elsharkawi asked for his phone back to make a call. Officer Rodriguez responded by stating that Mr. Elsharkawi had an attitude, was obviously racist, and had a problem with the uniform of CBP officers. Officer Rodriguez told Mr. Elsharkawi to put his hands behind his back, and handcuffed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officer Rodriguez, along with two other CBP officers, then began pulling Mr. Elsharkawi into an elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Mr. Elsharkawi feared for his safety. He turned to a nearby flight attendant and yelled to her, &quot;Please call a lawyer for me!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Elsharkawi was taken into the elevator and reached another floor of the airport, he again loudly yelled out, &quot;Someone help, someone call a lawyer for me. They said I’m not under arrest even though I’m handcuffed and they are taking me somewhere that I don’t know and will not let me have a lawyer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officer Rodriguez then pushed Mr. Elsharkawi’s arms up to his neck, to the point that Mr. Elsharkawi feared they would break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the CBP officers stated that Mr. Elsharkawi was causing a lot of problems, and recommended taking him downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsharkawi was taken to a holding cell and was eventually brought before a supervisor named Officer Stevenson. Stevenson explained that the agents were &quot;just protecting the country&quot; and that all he had to do was unlock his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Elsharkawi declined. This back-and-forth went on for some time, as new agents continued to search his bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The officers expressed no interest in searching his iPad, despite seeing it and removing it while searching his bags,&quot; the lawsuit continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another officer entered the scene, identified in the civil complaint as &quot;Officer Jennifer,&quot; who again began questioning Elsharkawi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after some back-and-forth, Elsharkawi &quot;felt he had no choice but to acquiesce and unlocked his phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officer Jennifer began searching his phone and asked Elsharkawi about his eBay and Amazon accounts, and &quot;where he got merchandise for his e-commerce business, and what swap meets he frequents. Officer Jennifer also commented that Mr. Elsharkawi had a lot of apps and a lot of unread emails on his phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A rare occurrence&lt;/h2&gt;

Lawyers for Elsharkawi believe that his phone was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5634603-Gov-Uscourts-Cacd-727665-1-0.html#document/p20/a471633&quot;&gt;imaged&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;A recent report &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/12/was-your-phone-imaged-by-border-agents-they-may-still-have-the-data/&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General found that some USB sticks containing data copied from electronic devices &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/what-could-happen-if-you-refuse-to-unlock-your-phone-at-the-us-border/&quot;&gt;searched at the border&lt;/a&gt; &quot;had not been deleted after the searches were completed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CBP’s own figures &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/digital-device-searches-at-us-border-increased-fivefold-from-2015-to-2016/&quot;&gt;sent to Ars in March 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the agency searched nearly 24,000 devices during fiscal year 2016, up from nearly 5,000 a year earlier. 2017 reached more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5498750-OIG-19-10-Nov18.html#document/p11/a470923&quot;&gt;29,000 &quot;inbound travelers.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; However, the agency maintains that such inspections are exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how many outbound travelers, like Elsharkawi, were subjected to such searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal authorities do not need a warrant to examine a phone or a computer seized at the border. They rely on what’s known as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_search_exception&quot;&gt;border doctrine&lt;/a&gt;&quot;—the legal idea that warrants are not required to conduct a search at the border. This legal theory has been generally recognized by courts, even in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 3:02pm ET&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;We are unable to comment on matters under litigation,&quot; emailed Stephanie Malin, a CBP spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She provided Ars with a lengthy statement referring to inbound travelers, which does not appear to be applicable to this lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Sandbox is a new lightweight desktop environment tailored for safely running applications in isolation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you downloaded an executable file, but were afraid to run it? Have you ever been in a situation which required a clean installation of Windows, but didn’t want to set up a virtual machine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft we regularly encounter these situations, so we developed &lt;strong&gt;Windows Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;: an isolated, temporary, desktop environment where you can run untrusted software without the fear of lasting impact to your PC. Any software installed in Windows Sandbox stays only in the sandbox and cannot affect your host. Once Windows Sandbox is closed, all the software with all its files and state are permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Sandbox has the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of Windows&lt;/strong&gt; – everything required for this feature ships with Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise. No need to download a VHD!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pristine&lt;/strong&gt; – every time Windows Sandbox runs, it’s as clean as a brand-new installation of Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposable&lt;/strong&gt; – nothing persists on the device; everything is discarded after you close the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure&lt;/strong&gt; – uses hardware-based virtualization for kernel isolation, which relies on the Microsoft’s hypervisor to run a separate kernel which isolates Windows Sandbox from the host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient&lt;/strong&gt; – uses integrated kernel scheduler, smart memory management, and virtual GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites for using the feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise build 18305 or later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMD64 architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtualization capabilities enabled in BIOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 1 GB of free disk space (SSD recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 2 CPU cores (4 cores with hyperthreading recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId-1673247913&quot;&gt;Quick start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, build 18305 or newer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable virtualization:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are using a physical machine, ensure virtualization capabilities are enabled in the BIOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using a virtual machine, enable nested virtualization with this PowerShell cmdlet:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set-VMProcessor -VMName &amp;lt;VMName&amp;gt; -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Windows Features, and then select Windows Sandbox. Select &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; to install Windows Sandbox. You might be asked to restart the computer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt; menu, find Windows Sandbox, run it and allow the elevation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy an executable file from the host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the executable file in the window of Windows Sandbox (on the Windows desktop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the executable in the Windows Sandbox; if it is an installer go ahead and install it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the application and use it as you normally do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re done experimenting, you can simply close the Windows Sandbox application. All sandbox content will be discarded and permanently deleted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirm that the host does not have any of the modifications that you made in Windows Sandbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62786i559AE3EDA7C968A4/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;Windows Sandbox Screenshot - open.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Windows Sandbox Screenshot - open.jpg&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62786i559AE3EDA7C968A4?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'62786i559AE3EDA7C968A4'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'301849'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId--878909048&quot;&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId-863901287&quot;&gt;Windows Sandbox internals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is the Windows Kernel Internals blog, let’s go under the hood. Windows Sandbox builds on the technologies used within &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Windows Containers&lt;/a&gt;. Windows containers were designed to run in the cloud. We took that technology, added integration with Windows 10, and built features that make it more suitable to run on devices and laptops without requiring the full power of Windows Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key enhancements we have made include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--1884769179&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--141958844&quot;&gt;Dynamically generated Image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core Windows Sandbox is a lightweight virtual machine, so it needs an operating system image to boot from. One of the key enhancements we have made for Windows Sandbox is the ability to use a copy of the Windows 10 installed on your computer, instead of downloading a new VHD image as you would have to do with an ordinary virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to always present a clean environment, but the challenge is that some operating system files can change. Our solution is to construct what we refer to as “dynamic base image”: an operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host. The majority of the files are links (immutable files) and that's why the small size (~100MB) for a full operating system. We call this instance the “base image” for Windows Sandbox, using Windows Container parlance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Windows Sandbox is not installed, we keep the dynamic base image in a compressed package which is only 25MB. When installed the dynamic base package it occupies about 100MB disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62787i9053915B9D0FABFC/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;Dynamic Image.PNG&quot; title=&quot;Dynamic Image.PNG&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62787i9053915B9D0FABFC?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'62787i9053915B9D0FABFC'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'301849'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId-1600851491&quot;&gt;Smart memory management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory management is another area where we have integrated with the Windows Kernel. Microsoft’s hypervisor allows a single physical machine to be carved up into multiple virtual machines which share the same physical hardware. While that approach works well for traditional server workloads, it isn't as well suited to running devices with more limited resources. We designed Windows Sandbox in such a way that the host can reclaim memory from the Sandbox if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since Windows Sandbox is basically running the same operating system image as the host we also allow Windows sandbox to use the same physical memory pages as the host for operating system binaries via a technology we refer to as “direct map”. In other words, the same executable pages of ntdll, are mapped into the sandbox as that on the host. We take care to ensure this done in a secure manner and no secrets are shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62788i128C6F57EFF45C5F/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;Direct Map.PNG&quot; title=&quot;Direct Map.PNG&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62788i128C6F57EFF45C5F?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'62788i128C6F57EFF45C5F'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'301849'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--951305470&quot;&gt;Integrated kernel scheduler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ordinary virtual machines, Microsoft’s hypervisor controls the scheduling of the virtual processors running in the VMs. However, for Windows Sandbox we use a new technology called “integrated scheduler” which allows the host to decide when the sandbox runs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Windows Sandbox we employ a unique scheduling policy that allows the virtual processors of the sandbox to be scheduled in the same way as threads would be scheduled for a process. High-priority tasks on the host can preempt less important work in the sandbox. The benefit of using the integrated scheduler is that the host manages Windows Sandbox as a process rather than a virtual machine which results in a much more responsive host, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Linux KVM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole goal here is to treat the Sandbox like an app but with the security guarantees of a Virtual Machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId-791504865&quot;&gt;Snapshot and clone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, Windows Sandbox uses Microsoft’s hypervisor. We're essentially running another copy of Windows which needs to be booted and this can take some time. So rather than paying the full cost of booting the sandbox operating system every time we start Windows Sandbox, we use two other technologies; “snapshot” and “clone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snapshot allows us to boot the sandbox environment once and preserve the memory, CPU, and device state to disk. Then we can restore the sandbox environment from disk and put it in the memory rather than booting it, when we need a new instance of Windows Sandbox. This significantly improves the start time of Windows Sandbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--1760652096&quot;&gt;Graphics virtualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware accelerated rendering is key to a smooth and responsive user experience, especially for graphics-intense or media-heavy use cases. However, virtual machines are isolated from their hosts and unable to access advanced devices like GPUs. The role of graphics virtualization technologies, therefore, is to bridge this gap and provide hardware acceleration in virtualized environments; e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-remotefx-vgpu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Microsoft RemoteFX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Microsoft has worked with our graphics ecosystem partners to integrate modern graphics virtualization capabilities directly into DirectX and WDDM, the driver model used by display drivers on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, this form of graphics virtualization works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apps running in a Hyper-V VM use graphics APIs as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics components in the VM, which have been enlightened to support virtualization, coordinate across the VM boundary with the host to execute graphics workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The host allocates and schedules graphics resources among apps in the VM alongside the apps running natively. Conceptually they behave as one pool of graphics clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62790i61A67D5F66C1E3E4/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=400&quot; alt=&quot;GPU virtualization for Sandbox - diagram.png&quot; title=&quot;GPU virtualization for Sandbox - diagram.png&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62790i61A67D5F66C1E3E4?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'62790i61A67D5F66C1E3E4'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'301849'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables the Windows Sandbox VM to benefit from hardware accelerated rendering, with Windows dynamically allocating graphics resources where they are needed across the host and guest. The result is improved performance and responsiveness for apps running in Windows Sandbox, as well as improved battery life for graphics-heavy use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of these benefits, you’ll need a system with a compatible GPU and graphics drivers (WDDM 2.5 or newer). Incompatible systems will render apps in Windows Sandbox with Microsoft’s CPU-based rendering technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--17841761&quot;&gt;Battery pass-through&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Sandbox is also aware of the host’s battery state, which allows it to optimize power consumption. This is critical for a technology that will be used on laptops, where not wasting battery is important to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId--1488208652&quot;&gt;Filing bugs and suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any new technology, there may be bugs. Please file them so that we can continually improve this feature. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For years, Facebook gave some of the world’s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users’ personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times. The records, generated in 2017 by the company’s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network’s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users — control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook allowed Microsoft’s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users’ friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users’ private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users’ names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends’ posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook has been reeling from a series of privacy scandals, set off by revelations in March that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;improperly used Facebook data&lt;/a&gt; to build tools that aided President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Acknowledging that it had breached users’ trust, Facebook insisted that it had instituted stricter privacy protections long ago. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20180411/108090/HHRG-115-IF00-Transcript-20180411.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assured lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; in April that people “have complete control” over everything they share on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Facebook’s strategy for handling crises:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;delay, deny and deflect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies — most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[Here are&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/facebook-data-sharing-deals.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;five takeaways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;from The Times’s investigation.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook’s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users’ privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. “We know we’ve got work to do to regain people’s trust,” Mr. Satterfield said. “Protecting people’s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that’s where we’ve been focused for most of 2018.” He said that the partnerships were “one area of focus” and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies’ access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;With most of the partnerships, Mr. Satterfield said, the F.T.C. agreement did not require the social network to secure users’ consent before sharing data because Facebook considered the partners extensions of itself — service providers that allowed users to interact with their Facebook friends. The partners were prohibited from using the personal information for other purposes, he said. “Facebook’s partners don’t get to ignore people’s privacy settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Data privacy experts disputed Facebook’s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. “The only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,” said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.’s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,” said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.’s consumer protection bureau. “I don’t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Details of the agreements are emerging at a pivotal moment for the world’s largest social network. Facebook has been hammered with questions about its data sharing from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe. The F.T.C. this spring opened a new inquiry into Facebook’s compliance with the consent order, while the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/technology/facebook-federal-investigations.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This month, a British parliamentary committee investigating internet disinformation &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/technology/facebook-documents-uk-parliament.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;released internal Facebook emails&lt;/a&gt;, seized from the plaintiff in another lawsuit against Facebook. The messages disclosed some partnerships and depicted a company preoccupied with growth, whose leaders sought to undermine competitors and briefly considered selling access to user data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Facebook has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;one crisis after another&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s critics, including some former advisers and employees, have singled out the data-sharing as cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I don’t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,” said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. “No one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-4a08b9a0&quot;&gt;An Engine for Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Personal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people — and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook’s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform’s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

The data-sharing deals were vetted at senior levels, sometimes by her and Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as “capabilities” — the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system — records that reflect just a portion of Facebook’s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called “People You May Know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The feature, introduced in 2008, continues even though some Facebook users have objected to it, unsettled by its knowledge of their real-world relationships. Gizmodo and other news outlets &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the tool’s recommending friend connections between patients of the same psychiatrist, estranged family members, and a harasser and his victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei — which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials — to gain deeper insight into people’s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users’ contact information through their friends — even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users’ email addresses through their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;One of Facebook’s device partners was Huawei, a Chinese company flagged as a security threat by United States intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wang Zhao/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users’ private messages, and to see all participants on a thread — privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A Royal Bank of Canada spokesman disputed that the bank had any such access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users’ personal information in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends’ posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2011. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times — one of nine media companies named in the documents — had access to users’ friend lists for an article-sharing application it also had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s internal records also revealed more about the extent of sharing deals with over 60 makers of smartphones, tablets and other devices, agreements first &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;reported by The Times&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Facebook enabled Apple devices to conceal that they were asking for data, making it impossible for users to disable sharing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alisa Yuldybaeva/EPA, via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook’s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to “rigorous controls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Yet Facebook has an imperfect track record of policing what outside companies do with its user data. In the Cambridge Analytica case, a Cambridge University psychology professor created an application in 2014 to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;harvest the personal data&lt;/a&gt; of tens of millions of Facebook users for the consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users’ information after sharing it broadly. “It travels,” Ms. Dixon said. “It could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-39d6b34&quot;&gt;400 Million Exposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Unlike Europe, where social media companies have had to adapt to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stricter regulation&lt;/a&gt;, the United States has no general consumer privacy law, leaving tech companies free to monetize most kinds of personal information as long as they don’t mislead their users. The F.T.C., which regulates trade, can bring enforcement actions against companies that deceive their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Besides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s agreement with regulators is a result of the company’s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users’ locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook called this “instant personalization” and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Under the decree, the social network introduced a “comprehensive privacy program” charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook’s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company’s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews — numbering about a dozen people by 2016 — was moved around within Facebook’s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Critically, many of Facebook’s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review “depended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends’ information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network’s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Facebook continued the access for Pandora, the music-streaming service, and other companies even after an F.T.C. agreement led to an official change in policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shannon Stapleton/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users’ privacy because it allowed access only to public data — though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users’ friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in “feature development” and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-918b1ef&quot;&gt;Compliance Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook’s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency’s approach to privacy regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“There has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users’ privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,” said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. “We brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;According to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers — companies that use the data only “for and at the direction of” Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term “integration partners” to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses — including internet companies such as Yahoo — Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook’s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine’s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations “have no merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;The Russian company Yandex, which has been accused of funneling information to the Kremlin, had access to Facebook data as recently as last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mikhail Metzel/TASS, via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook’s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.’s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But federal regulators had reason to know about the partnerships — and to question whether Facebook was adequately safeguarding users’ privacy. According to a letter that Facebook sent this fall to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, PricewaterhouseCoopers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/technology/facebook-data-privacy-users.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;reviewed at least some of Facebook’s data partnerships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only “limited” evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners’ use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook’s privacy program a passing grade over all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments — in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers — are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook’s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Steve Satterfield, Facebook’s director of privacy and public policy, said the sharing deals did not violate privacy rules because the partners functioned as extensions of the social network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Isopix/REX/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“These were high-touch relationships,” Mr. Satterfield said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Librem 5 dev kits are shipping</title>
<link>https://puri.sm/posts/2018-devkits-are-shipping/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://puri.sm/posts/2018-devkits-are-shipping/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Librem 5 dev kit’s hardware is done and shipping! We are beyond excited for our backers to receive their dev kits before year-end. Our entire PureOS Librem 5 development team will getting the same dev kits, upgrading the generic i.MX 6 boards (which most of the demos you have seen have been based on) to the Purism i.MX 8M based dev kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim from this point forward to have a community assisted development environment. There is still a lot of work required to make the dev kit truly functional for Librem 5 development, so we need your assistance. The frenetic pace of development continues and it’s astonishing how much we’ve accomplished in the two months since we’ve put the hardware together. But the path is still long and arduous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our backers who are receiving the dev kits will also have access to a Matrix channel for dev kit owners. This channel will be staffed by our engineering team who will be on hand to answer questions, work with the community on merge requests, and be available for those who are using the dev kits. But by no means is this an exclusive channel and all of you are welcome to join in as well! Please join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://im.puri.sm/#/room/#librem-5-devkit:talk.puri.sm&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; that was set up for questions and answers on the dev kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61784 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/devkit-image-shipping-300x204.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;469&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/devkit-image-shipping-300x204.jpeg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/devkit-image-shipping-768x521.jpeg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/devkit-image-shipping.jpeg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61785 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/file1539881124897-300x169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/file1539881124897-300x169.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/file1539881124897-768x432.jpg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/file1539881124897-1024x576.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With about four months to go until we ship the phones, we are going to need the community to help in the final sprint to the finish line. So we look forward to your help with testing, feature requests, and of course code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 is going to be an amazing year with the introduction of the first privacy and security focused mobile phone and we can’t wait to get it in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we are incredibly grateful for all of the support you’ve shown us and we’re working hard to do right by your belief in us. We hope to see some of you in our Matrix channels going forward. Till then onward and upward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.s.: You will note that there is a promotion this holiday season. For those of you who are in the market for a phone and a laptop, check out our “Have A Secure Life” Laptop and Phone bundle read further about having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/2018-holiday-season-bundle-sale/&quot;&gt;secure life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the phone’s early-bird preorder pricing at $599 will end soon; after January 7th the preorder price will rise to $699 to cover our expenses for the phone. The money coming from this will be used to fund further engineering of the phone and to help people from the community to work on upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What a Newfound Kingdom Means for the Tree of Life</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-a-newfound-kingdom-means-for-the-tree-of-life-20181211/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-a-newfound-kingdom-means-for-the-tree-of-life-20181211/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The tree of life just got another major branch. Researchers recently found a certain rare and mysterious microbe called a hemimastigote in a clump of Nova Scotian soil. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0708-8&quot;&gt;Their subsequent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of its DNA revealed that it was neither animal, plant, fungus nor any recognized type of protozoan — that it in fact fell far outside any of the known large categories for classifying complex forms of life (eukaryotes). Instead, this flagella-waving oddball stands as the first member of its own “supra-kingdom” group, which probably peeled away from the other big branches of life at least a billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the sort of result you hope to see once in a career,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://protists.biology.dal.ca/index.html&quot;&gt;Alastair Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at Dalhousie University who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressive as this finding about hemimastigotes is on its own, what matters more is that it’s just the latest (and most profound) of a quietly and steadily growing number of major taxonomic additions. Researchers keep uncovering not just new species or classes but entirely new kingdoms of life — raising questions about how they have stayed hidden for so long and how close we are to finding them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://protists.biology.dal.ca/people.html&quot;&gt;Yana Eglit&lt;/a&gt; is a Dalhousie graduate student dedicated to discovering novel lineages of the single-cell eukaryotes called protists. While hiking in Nova Scotia on a cold spring day in 2016, she fell back from her friends to scrape a few grams of dirt into a plastic tube. (Such impromptu soil sampling, she said, is “a professional hazard.”) Back in the lab, Eglit soaked her sample in water, and over the next month she periodically peeked at it through a microscope for signs of unusual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late one evening, something odd in the sample caught her eye. An elongated cell radiating whiplike flagella was “awkwardly swimming, as though it didn’t realize it had all these flagella that could help it move,” Eglit said. Under a more powerful scope, she saw it fit the description of a hemimastigote, a rare kind of protist that was notoriously hard to cultivate. The next morning, the lab was abuzz with excitement over the opportunity to describe and sequence the specimen. “We dropped everything,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemimastigotes represent one of a handful of Rumsfeldian “known unknown” protist lineages — moderately well-described groups whose positions on the tree of life are not precisely known because they are difficult to culture in a lab and sequence. Protistologists have used peculiarities of hemimastigotes’ structure to infer their close relatives, but their guesses were “‘shotgunned’ all over the phylogeny,” Simpson said. Without molecular data, lineages like hemimastigotes remain orphans of unknown ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new method called single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized such studies. It enables researchers to sequence large numbers of genes from just one cell. &lt;a href=&quot;http://protists.biology.dal.ca/people.html&quot;&gt;Gordon Lax&lt;/a&gt;, another graduate student in the Simpson lab and an expert on this method, explained that for hard-to-study organisms like hemimastigotes, single-cell transcriptomics can produce genetic data of a quality previously reserved for more abundant cells, making deeper genomic comparisons finally possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team sequenced more than 300 genes, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ettemalab.org/laura-eme/&quot;&gt;Laura Eme&lt;/a&gt;, now a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University, modeled how those genes evolved to infer a classification for hemimastigotes. “We were fully expecting them to fall within one of the existing supergroups,” she explained. Lab members were instead stunned to find that hemimastigotes fit nowhere on the tree. They represented their own distinct lineage apart from the other half-dozen super groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how evolutionarily distinct the hemimastigote lineage is, imagine the eukaryotic tree splayed out before you on the ground as a narrowing set of paths, which begin with places for all living groups of eukaryotes near your toes and converge far in the distance at our common ancestor. Starting at our mammalian tip, walk down the path and back into history, past the fork where our lineage diverged from reptiles and birds, past the turnoffs for fishes, for starfish and for insects, and then farther still, beyond the split that separates us from fungi. If you turn around and look back, all the diverse organisms you passed fall within just one of the six eukaryote supergroups. Hemimastigotes are still up ahead, in a supergroup of their own, on a path that nothing else occupies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.burki-lab.net/fabien-asst-prof.html&quot;&gt;Fabien Burki&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Uppsala University in Sweden who wasn’t involved in this study, was happy to see this result, but not entirely surprised. “It’s a bit like searching for life on other planets,” he said. “When we finally find it, I don’t think we will be very surprised, but it will be a huge discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burki, Simpson, Eglit and many others also think we have much more of the tree of life to uncover, largely because of how quickly it’s changing. “The tree of life is being reshaped by new data. It is really quite different than even what it was 15 or 20 years ago,” Burki said. “We’re seeing a tree with many more branches than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a lineage as distinct as hemimastigotes is still relatively rare. But if you go down a level or two on the hierarchy, to the mere kingdom level — the one that encompasses, say, all animals — you find that new major lineages are popping up about once a year. “That rate isn’t slowing down,” said Simpson. “If anything, it might be speeding up.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stop Learning Frameworks</title>
<link>https://sizovs.net/2018/12/17/stop-learning-frameworks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sizovs.net/2018/12/17/stop-learning-frameworks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are developers. We need to stay up to date with technology. Every day, we learn programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. The more modern tools we know — the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping up to date with Angular, React, Vue, Riot, Ember, Knockout is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are wasting our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is the most precious resource we have. Time is limited, nonrenewable and you cannot buy more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology, like fashion, is changing at the speed of light. To catch up, we need to run very fast. This race has no winners because it has no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/wolf.jpg&quot;/&gt; © The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) by Martin Scorsese
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mentor once taught me a lesson:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Ed, what are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me (proud): “I am reading a book about building modern Java apps with GWT.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “What for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “As a Java developer, I need to keep up with trends. GWT is a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “What technology book did you read before GWT?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “It’s a 500-page-long Apache Tapestry book. Tapestry was a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Is Tapestry still a thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “Not anymore. GWT is a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Can you re-use Tapestry skills to solve current problems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “No, no one is using it today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Does Tapestry knowledge help you understand GWT better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “No, it doesn’t. But I see some overlapping patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “It’s Design Patterns. Do they help you solve current problems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “Yes. Many of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Technology come and go, but it has a lot in common. Set priorities right. Invest 80% of your learning time in fundamentals. Leave 20% for frameworks, libraries and tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “Hmm… Only 20% for frameworks, libraries, and tools?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “Yes. You’ll learn them at work anyway while solving problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “Thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: “You’ll thank me later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This advice has changed my life&lt;/strong&gt;. I removed all framework books from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/eduardsi&quot;&gt;my bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;. The guilt pile shrank from 50 to 0 books. What a relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a set of evergreen books. These books took 80% of my learning time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also bought a single book on the current technology. &lt;strong&gt;The Lindy effect&lt;/strong&gt; suggested that Spring Framework must be a good investment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future life expectancy of technology is proportional to its current age. Every extra period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer a technology is on the market, the safer investment it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t rush to learn new technology – it has a high probability of dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will show which technology is worth investing in. Time is your best advisor. Learn to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years have passed since then. I helped 50 different software projects. Thanks to the advice, everything I learn is portable across companies, teams, domains. My knowledge is still relevant today. &lt;strong&gt;I did not waste my time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All projects seem different unless you look under the surface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programming languages are different, but design smells are alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks are different, but the same design patterns shine through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers are different, but rules of dealing with people are uniform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember – frameworks, libraries and tools come and go. Time is precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/intime.png&quot;/&gt; © In Time (2011) by Andrew Niccol

<title>How Alexa knows “peanut butter” is one shopping-list item, not two</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/36ca7d4c-cd98-40a9-a9c5-0cde2ab922ab/how-alexa-knows-that-peanut-butter-is-one-shopping-list-item-not-two</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.aboutamazon.com/devices/how-alexa-keeps-getting-smarter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press event&lt;/a&gt; on Alexa's latest features, Alexa’s head scientist, Rohit Prasad, mentioned multistep requests in one shot, a capability that allows you to ask Alexa to do multiple things at once. For example, you might say, “Alexa, add bananas, peanut butter, and paper towels to my shopping list.” Alexa should intelligently figure out that “peanut butter” and “paper towels” name two items, not four, and that bananas are a separate item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical spoken-language understanding (SLU) systems map user utterances to intents (actions) and slots (entity names). For example, the utterance “What is the weather like in Boston?” has one intent, WeatherInfo, and one slot type, CityName, whose value is “Boston.” This is an example of a “narrow parse”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrow parsers usually have rigid constraints, such as allowing only one intent to be associated with an utterance and only one value to be associated with a slot type. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11497.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that we’re presenting at this year’s IEEE Spoken Language Technology conference (SLT 2018), we discuss a way to enable SLU systems to understand compound entities and intents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We augment an SLU system with a domain-agnostic parser that can identify syntactic elements that establish relationships between different parts of an utterance, or “coordination structures”. In tests comparing our system to an off-the-shelf broad syntactic parser, we show a 26% increase in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-the-shelf broad parsers are intended to detect coordination structures, but they are often trained on written text with correct punctuation. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs, by contrast, often lack punctuation, and spoken language has different syntactic patterns than written language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new parser is a deep neural network that we train on varied coordination structures in spoken-language data. The training examples are labeled according to the BIO scheme, which indicates groups of words — or “chunks” — that should be treated as ensembles. Most of the words in a sample utterance are labeled with either a &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, to indicate the beginning of a chunk, an &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, to indicate the inside of a chunk, or an &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt;, to indicate a word that lies outside a chunk. Coordinating conjunctions such as “and” are labeled independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;BIO_scheme_examples.png&quot; src=&quot;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/DeveloperBlogs/AlexaBlogs/default/BIO_scheme_examples.png._CB459952676_.png?t=true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Sample utterances, labeled according to the BIO scheme&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inputs to the network undergo &lt;em&gt;embedding&lt;/em&gt;, a process that represents words as points (vectors) in high-dimensional spaces. We experiment with two different types of embeddings: word embeddings, in which words with similar functions are clustered together, and character embeddings, in which words that contain the same subsequences of letters are clustered together. Character embeddings are useful for systems like ours that are intended to generalize across contexts, because they enable educated guesses about the meanings of unfamiliar words on the basis of their roots, prefixes, and suffixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embeddings then pass through a bidirectional long short-term memory. Long short-term memories (LSTMs) are networks that process sequential data in order, and any given output factors in the outputs that precede it. Bidirectional LSTMs run through a given data sequence both forward and backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the bi-LSTM is a contextual embedding of each word in the input sentence, which captures information about its position in the sentence. On top of the bi-LSTM layer, we have a dense layer to map each contextual word embedding to a distribution over the output labels, which are the B, I, and O of the BIO scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experiments, we evaluated a system that classifies each word of the input according to its most probable output label. But we got better results by passing the label estimates through a conditional-random-field (CRF) layer. The CRF layer learns associations between output labels and chooses the most likely sequence of output labels from all possible sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we relied directly on the output of the label-prediction layer, it was possible to get incoherent outputs — such as an &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt; tag followed by an &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; tag — since each label is independently predicted. The CRF layer, however, would learn that such a sequence of output labels is unlikely and assign it a low score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building separate parsers for different slot types (such as ListItem, FoodItem, Appliance, etc.), we built one parser that can handle multiple slot types. For example, our parser can successfully identify ListItems in the utterance “add apples peanut butter and jelly to my list” and Appliances in the utterance “turn on the living room light and kitchen light”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable our model to generalize, we used a technique called adversarial training. During training, the output of the bi-LSTM layer passes not only to the densely connected layer that learns to predict BIO labels but to another layer that learns to predict &lt;em&gt;domains&lt;/em&gt;, or broad topic categories such as Weather, Music, and Groceries. The network is evaluated not only on how &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; it predicts BIO labels but on how &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; it predicts domain labels. That way, we ensure that it learns chunking cues that are not domain-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate data for our experiments, we take annotated single-entity data and replace the single entities with two or more entities of the same slot type with coordinating conjunctions between the penultimate entity and the final entity. For example, the utterance “set the timer for five minutes” might become “set the timer for five and ten minutes”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran an extensive set of experiments with variations in how the word embeddings are initialized (randomly or with pretrained embeddings, such as FastText, that group words together by meaning), whether or not we use character embeddings, and whether or not we use the CRF layer at the top. We tested separately on two-entity, three-entity, and four-or-more-entity utterances and measured accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed a few general trends: irrespective of the model configuration, accuracy degrades as we move from two- to three- to four-or-more-entity utterances; initialization with pretrained embeddings usually helps; and adding a CRF layer almost always improves accuracy. Our best results — the ones that improved most on the off-the-shelf parser — came from a model that used character embeddings, pretrained FastText embeddings, and a CRF layer.&lt;/p&gt;
