<description>Amazon S3 currently supports two request URI styles in all regions: path-style (also known as V1) that includes bucket name in the path of the URI (example: //s3.amazonaws.com//key), and virtual-hosted style (also known as V2) which uses the bucket name as part of the domain name (example: //.s3.amazonaws.com/key). In our effort to continuously improve customer experience, the path-style naming convention is being retired in favor of virtual-hosted style request format. Customers should update their applications to use the virtual-hosted style request format when making S3 API requests before September 30th, 2020 to avoid any service disruptions. Customers using the AWS SDK can upgrade to the most recent version of the SDK to ensure their applications are using the virtual-hosted style request format.&lt;p&gt;Virtual-hosted style requests are supported for all S3 endpoints in all AWS regions. S3 will stop accepting requests made using the path-style request format in all regions starting September 30th, 2020. Any requests using the path-style request format made after this time will fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is any reason why your application is not able to utilize the virtual-hosted style request format, or if you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;AWS Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>You can’t judge housing affordability without knowing transportation costs</title>
<link>http://cityobservatory.org/transportation_housing_affordability/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://cityobservatory.org/transportation_housing_affordability/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “commonly accepted” 30 percent standard for judging housing affordability leaves out transportation and location&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At City Observatory, we’ve long been dissatisfied with commonly used measures of describing housing affordability. There are lots of reasons to believe that a single, fixed percentage of income standard does a poor job of reflecting whether housing is priced appropriately, and whether households are being asked to spend too much. We’ve explored some of these issues before, but today we want to focus on one key issue–the tradeoff between cheap rents and costly transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprawl apologists tout the low housing prices of cities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.city-journal.org/html/battle-houston-16113.html&quot;&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, but invariably they leave out the fact that sprawling cities necessarily imply higher transportation costs. If you have to drive everywhere, and drive further for every trip, what you save in rent or mortgage payments, can be more than eaten up in car payments, gasoline purchases, and time wasted traveling. As we noted in our report on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityobservatory.org/introducing-the-sprawl-tax/&quot;&gt;Sprawl Tax&lt;/a&gt;, the added sprawl of cities like Houston cost the typical worker nearly $3,000 per year, not including the value of lost time. The same pattern also holds within housing markets as well as across them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In virtually every major urban real estate market, a major determinant of rent and housing prices is accessibility.  If you live in a dense, walkable urban neighborhood, you might manage to live quite comfortably not owning a car, or having just one car for a two-worker family.  If you live on the exurban edge, in a low density subdivision, you might need to own multiple cars just to manage the daily chores of school, shopping and play, as well as commuting to work. It turns out that the value of accessibility gets priced in to the walkable, well-located housing; and conversely, rental and for sale housing that’s located at a distance from everything is priced at a discount to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means as a practical matter that you can’t judge whether an individual household’s living situation is affordable just by looking at whether they spend less than 30 percent of their income directly on housing. Consider this example: two otherwise identical households.  One lives in a suburb, owns two cars, and drives most places. They spend 30 percent of their income on housing and 20 percent of their income on transportation.  The second household lives in a city and owns one car.  Their house is more expensive than the suburban one, so they spend 40 percent of their income on housing, and just 10 percent on transportation. Is it really accurate to describe the second (city) household as any more “cost-burdened” than its suburban peer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essential insight behind the Center for Neighborhood Technology’s “H+T” &lt;a href=&quot;http://htaindex.cnt.org/&quot;&gt;Housing and Transportation Index&lt;/a&gt;, which quantifies the approximate costs associated with housing and transportation in different neighborhoods. They’ve used census data on income and housing costs, and estimates of commuting patterns, transit available and car ownership to estimate what fraction of a household’s income gets spent on housing and transportation in different locations. They show that some neighborhoods with high housing costs are actually more affordable than lower rent areas, once you add in the savings in transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report from the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard shines a slightly different light on this question, by revealing differences in spending patterns among households. This report examines data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is constructed from spending diaries completed by a random sample of American households. We’ve taken their analysis from Table W-6, and reformatted it slightly, computing the share of total spending on housing and transportation for each income group.  We’ve also truncated the table to exclude a detailed breakout of other types of spending (food, apparel, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4767&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?resize=519%2C470&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?w=519 519w, https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?resize=300%2C272 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Expenditure Survey divides households into four quartiles according to household spending.  The lowest quartile spends the least (about $1,370 per month); the highest quartile spends about $9,300.  Within each quartile, the report divides households into three groups based on how much they spend on housing. Less than 30 percent is the group that is considered not-cost burdened by housing, 30 to 50 percent is cost-burdened by housing, and households spending more than 50 percent are severely cost burdened, according to this rubric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting to note here, is how, within each quartile, households that spend &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; on housing end up spending a great deal &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; on transportation.  Conversely, households that spend a larger fraction of their income on housing spend, on average much less on transportation. For example, households in the second quartile who spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing spend 12.6 percent of their income on transportation. That falls to less than 10 percent for those who are somewhat cost burdened, and less than 5 percent for those who are severely cost burdened. This pattern across income groups is consistent with the idea of a tradeoff between cheaper rents and higher transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its especially instructive to look at households in the highest spending quartile.  These are the 25 percent or so of most affluent households (as judged by their spending patterns), with monthly spending of about $9,300.  Households that spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing in this group spend $2,300 per month on transportation. Meanwhile, their peers with higher housing costs spend dramatically less on transportation ($400 to $600 per month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are important limitations to the Consumer Expenditure Survey data presented here. They aren’t adjusted for household size (small households tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on rent than larger ones), nor do they adjust for age, or exclude households who have paid of their mortgages (which also tends to dramatically affect reported household spending patterns). Nonetheless, the consumer spending data confirm that there’s a connection between lower rents and higher transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implication is that we shouldn’t be talking about housing affordability in isolation. We should really be talking about “affordable living” rather than “affordable housing.” If your rent is low, but you have to spend a disproportionately large share of your income on transportation, then your living situation isn’t affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than two years after buying Tumblr as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/oath-verizon-completes-4-5-billion-buy-of-yahoo-and-merges-it-with-aol/&quot;&gt;Yahoo acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon is reportedly trying to sell the blogging platform. Pornhub has also announced that it wants to buy Tumblr and end the site's Verizon-imposed porn ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Verizon Communications Inc. is seeking a buyer for blogging website Tumblr, according to people familiar with the matter, as it tries to steady a media business that has struggled to meet revenue targets,&quot; The Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-looks-to-unload-tumblr-blogging-site-11556823135&quot;&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pornhub quickly announced its interest after the news broke, although it isn't clear whether the two companies have talked. Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/verizon-takes-aim-at-tumblrs-kneecaps-bans-all-adult-content/&quot;&gt;banned all adult content&lt;/a&gt; from Tumblr in December 2018, and Pornhub wants to restore the site to its former porn-filled glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are obvious synergies between the two brands and value Pornhub could derive from Tumblr,&quot; Pornhub VP Corey Price said in a statement to Ars. &quot;We’re extremely interested in acquiring the platform and are very much looking forward to one day restoring it to its former glory with NSFW content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Pornhub if it has submitted an offer to buy Tumblr or at least spoken directly with Verizon about it, but we did not get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tumblr was a safe haven for those who wanted to explore and express their sexuality, adult entertainment aficionados included,&quot; Price's statement also said. &quot;We’ve long been dismayed that such measures were taken to eradicate erotic communities on the platform, leaving many individuals without an asylum through which they could comfortably peruse adult content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornhub's interest in buying Tumblr was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/pornhub-interested-in-buying-tumblr&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon declined to comment when contacted by Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Verizon announced the Tumblr porn ban, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/tumblrs-porn-ban-is-going-about-as-badly-as-expected/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tumblr's algorithm for enforcing the ban was &quot;flagging non-adult content as adult content, and vice versa.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon’s Yahoo/AOL division&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WSJ report said Verizon's sale process for Tumblr &quot;is ongoing and may not result in any transaction,&quot; and that &quot;[i]t is unclear how much Verizon might get for Tumblr.&quot; The WSJ report didn't mention any potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/yahoo-will-purchase-tumblr-for-1-1-billion-according-to-wsj-report/&quot;&gt;Yahoo bought Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; for $1.1 billion in 2013, but it later &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/07/yahoo-may-not-have-screwed-tumblr-up-but-it-has-hemhorraged-money/&quot;&gt;wrote down about half of that value&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon bought Yahoo's operating business, including Tumblr, for $4.48 billion in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon hoped Yahoo and previously acquired AOL would help it create a huge online advertising business. It hasn't gone well. Verizon laid off 7 percent of employees in the Yahoo/AOL division &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/verizon-cuts-7-percent-of-staff-in-failing-yahooaol-division/&quot;&gt;in January this year&lt;/a&gt;, a month after telling investors that the media division &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/verizon-cuts-10000-jobs-and-admits-its-yahooaol-division-is-a-failure/&quot;&gt;had &quot;lower-than-expected revenues and earnings&quot;&lt;/a&gt; as it lost ground to online advertising industry leaders Google and Facebook. Verizon recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of about $4.6 billion, wiping out nearly all of the Yahoo/AOL division's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/verizon-signals-its-yahoo-aol-divisions-are-almost-worthless-n946846&quot;&gt;goodwill value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>America’s Oldest Gun Maker Went Bankrupt: A Financial Engineering Mystery</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/remington-guns-jobs-huntsville.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/remington-guns-jobs-huntsville.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he news spread around Huntsville, Ala., in the winter of 2014. Remington, the country’s oldest gun maker, had decided to expand from its historic home in upstate New York to a gigantic former Chrysler factory near the airport. Workers at the new plant, the company said, would earn a minimum average of $19.50 an hour assembling shotguns, pistols, hunting rifles and AR-15-style semiautomatics. The city’s mayor wrote in a newspaper column that he was thrilled that Remington’s quest for a new factory space had ended in Huntsville. He calculated the typical annual salary as $42,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Huntsville is a boomtown in the Southern mold. The unemployment rate is lower than the country’s, and educated workers are in high demand. Southwest of downtown, in a facility that synthesized chemical weapons during World War II, the Army maintains a major research center and garrison. Orbiting the Army base are military and aerospace contractors: Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Car companies from Japan, an electronics manufacturer from Korea and many other concerns churn out goods for the domestic market. “Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest!” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/951236634095308800?lang=en&quot;&gt;President Trump tweeted in January 2018&lt;/a&gt;; he was talking about Huntsville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Since 1993, when the state gave Mercedes-Benz $253 million to build its first American auto plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama has refashioned itself as a kind of foundry for the rest of the country and the world, first courting automakers and then becoming an all-purpose workshop and technology hub. Airbus produces A320 jetliners; Toyota makes engines for Rav4s and Tundras; Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s “spacefaring” company, recently broke ground on a rocket-engine plant. These companies are drawn here partly by the benefits that Trump cited, but most forcefully by the generous tax-incentive packages doled out by officials in Montgomery, the state capital, in concert with pro-business mayors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Huntsvillians take pride in their economy, and when a new company comes to town, good will cascades toward it. In early 2015, wearing a shirt and hat from Remington could even score you the best table at a restaurant. In the display cases at Larry’s Pistol and Pawn, Huntsville’s most respected gun shop, managers made room for Remington pistols stamped with “Huntsville, AL”: It was a point of pride to carry a weapon made in-state. “Locked and Loaded,” ran the headline in The Huntsville Times, for an article describing how the factory would ultimately create more than 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Doors opened in spring 2015. News from the inside was scarce, but this was more or less to be expected. Workers in the gun industry endure a special kind of scrutiny, like metal detectors at the exits and visits to their homes from A.T.F. agents looking for weapons that have gone missing. When Remington forbade employees to speak to outsiders about their jobs or fired a person who removed a smartphone from his pocket in the vicinity of the line, the explanation was assumed to be that the company was protecting its secrets, including the pace of its production. “Those assault rifles,” one employee told me, “they couldn’t make them fast enough.” That year, Remington earned $191 million in gross profit on $809 million of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At the top of the employees’ checks, the name “Remington Arms” was printed, along with the address of the company’s new facility at 1816 Remington Circle SW in Huntsville. But this was somewhat misleading. While the guns were still stamped with the thick-footed Remington R, the company no longer existed as a fully independent entity. Seven years before Remington came to Huntsville, it was purchased, at a relative bargain, by a private-equity firm that controlled tens of billions of dollars from its offices in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The firm, Cerberus Capital Management, takes its name from the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog who, in Greek mythology, stands guard at the gates of Hades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Feinberg,&lt;/strong&gt; co-founder and chief executive of Cerberus, came of age alongside his field. He was born in the Bronx, N.Y., in 1960, went to Princeton, where he studied politics, then after graduation, took a job at the brokerage house Drexel Burnham Lambert. As the journalist Connie Bruck recounted in her 1988 best seller, “The Predators’ Ball,” Drexel was a feral place in the early ’80s. Under the direction of its star financier, Michael Milken, the firm developed a way to help clients purchase whole companies using high-interest loans — a practice mainstream investment banks found far too risky to imitate. Milken could whip together nine figures for a client just by picking up the phone. The client took the borrowed cash, bought an obscure or struggling company, and tried either to renovate it or to stamp out costs — often through layoffs — and make it profitable. When these so-called “leveraged buyouts” worked, investors made a hundred or a thousand times their money. When they failed, the bought-out businesses crumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Milken made hundreds of millions of dollars from the fees he earned on leveraged buyouts. At Drexel’s parties at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Milken would unleash his male clients on a bungalow filled with what Bruck referred to as “extremely attractive young women” the firm had paid to be there. His career came to an abrupt halt in 1990, when he was convicted of securities fraud and was permanently banned from the stock market. (Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/politics/mnuchin-private-flight-michael-milken.html&quot;&gt;has reportedly lobbied Trump to pardon Milken&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Milken’s conviction coincided with the declining popularity of the term “leveraged buyout.” In the winter of 1988, the acquisition of R.J.R. Nabisco by a firm called KKR — one of the most televised news stories of the year — had taken the opaque practice directly into people’s kitchens and cigarette packs, where it turned out to be threatening and unwelcome. In 1990, Susan Faludi at The Wall Street Journal wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning story about a Safeway trucker in Dallas who worked for the supermarket chain for nearly 30 years, lost his job after KKR acquired it and shot himself in the head with a hunting rifle. The way people in 2008 talked about “credit default swaps” as a symbol of Wall Street lunacy, people in the early 1990s talked about leveraged buyouts. Faced with all this bad publicity, Wall Street decided it had only one option. It would have to change the name. Stephen Feinberg founded Cerberus in 1992 as the euphemism “private equity” was coming into currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;If Feinberg resembles Milken, it’s in superficial ways. Milken cultivated a “blue-collar billionaire” persona, speaking brashly and wearing jeans and loafers; Feinberg wore off-the-rack suits to his gray, dingy offices in New York. The young Milken would take a predawn bus from New Jersey to the Drexel offices in New York City while reading regulatory filings with a flashlight; when researching a deal, Feinberg is said to establish “war rooms” at his office and keep his staff until midnight or later. According to Bruck’s book, Milken seldom granted interviews, because “you can’t make a dime off publicity”; Feinberg is reported to have joked to a private meeting of his investors in 2007 that “if anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper, and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it.” (Feinberg declined to comment for this article.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Milken financed leveraged buyouts, but Feinberg made his name by investing directly in distressed assets, businesses that were in bad shape financially. His deal to acquire the parent company of National Car Rental is emblematic of his shrewdness. In 2003, the company was bankrupt, and Feinberg bought it for just $230 million. In four years, he realigned it toward the airport market, then sold it to Enterprise Rent-A-Car for $3 billion. During the rest of the ’00s, the firm expanded to mortgage lenders, real estate, department stores, automakers: anywhere it saw an inefficiency it could exploit. The industry had matured, too. No longer executing leveraged buyouts exclusively, private-equity firms had a host of investment strategies at their disposal. Twenty-seven years after Feinberg founded it, Cerberus was managing $39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Because private-equity firms appear frequently as villains in the press, many people assume that they cater mostly to the superrich, earning high returns on investments for billionaire clients. They do. But by far the most important piece of their business — 48 percent, according to the data-analytics firm Preqin — is investing capital for American pension funds. Beginning in the 1990s, pension managers and unions could see that when the baby-boom generation retired, there would be shortfalls between what the funds were obligated to pay out and the money they had — the so-called pension gap. An investment strategy that could return 15 to 20 percent a year and close that gap was an irresistible solution. The pension fund for the Boston-area public water utility invests in Cerberus. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, CalSTRS, is a Cerberus client, as is a pension fund for the Presbyterian Church as well as many university endowments, sovereign wealth funds and philanthropic foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Private-equity buyouts are associated in the public imagination with layoffs, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.23.1.121&quot;&gt;the research on that topic isn’t conclusive&lt;/a&gt;. Private-equity-owned firms don’t necessarily occasion more layoffs than publicly traded ones, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/690712&quot;&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; that private-equity firms may be responsible for increased polarization in the job market, that is, for eliminating midlevel roles and thereby contributing to the shrinking of the middle class. A company purchased by private equity can expect to be realigned aggressively, in a five- or 10-year window, to become more “efficient,” which often entails firing, automation and offshoring. For a pension fund, then, and especially the pension fund of a union, investing in private equity can be a devil’s bargain: helping retiring workers by using tools that may harm younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;When Cerberus bought Remington in 2007, the world was hurtling through the greatest rush of private-equity acquisitions in history. From 2002 to the crash in 2008, hundreds of billions of dollars a year were deployed in private-equity deals by firms like Cerberus, KKR and Blackstone. There were never fewer than 1,700 private-equity transactions annually; in 2007 the figure peaked at 7,400. After the crash briefly interrupted its momentum, the industry came back in force. The United States government was responding to the crisis by lowering borrowing costs to kick-start the economy. For private-equity firms, the access to cheap debt was a gift: It allowed them to purchase a long list of targets, then borrow more money using those targets as collateral. During the recovery, private-equity firms made an average of one trillion dollars’ worth of acquisitions every year. In 2017 there were a record 9,500 deals. By 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Private%20Equity%20and%20Principal%20Investors/Our%20Insights/Private%20markets%20come%20of%20age/Private-markets-come-of-age-McKinsey-Global-Private-Markets-Review-2019-vF.ashx&quot;&gt;according to the consulting firm McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;, the industry controlled $3.4 trillion in assets globally. If private equity were a country, it would be the fifth-largest economy on earth, beating India, Britain and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tommy Battle,&lt;/strong&gt; the mayor of Huntsville, is a hefty man who speaks in a baritone and wins ribbons at amateur barbecue cook-offs. In his office on the eighth floor of Huntsville’s City Hall, he has a plaque from Mazda and Toyota that looks like a pro-wrestling belt, a blue-tipped shovel with Facebook printed on the head and a long-barreled Remington rifle mounted on a wooden board. Each commemorates the opening of a factory or an office that Battle helped entice to move to Huntsville, mostly using tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Battle was re-elected in 2016 with 80 percent of the vote. His popularity springs from his ability to generate jobs — and to generate headlines about generating jobs. Though his endorsement of Roy Moore, who lost his bid for a seat in the United States Senate amid sexual-assault accusations, alienated some Huntsvillians — northern Alabamians consider themselves more socially liberal than their southern neighbors — Battle is mostly beloved by his constituents. When I met him in his office, his business-relations officer leaned over my recorder on the table and said, “If Amazon Web Services is reading right now, tell them we’d love to have a data center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2013, Battle learned that a site-selection consultant, someone who helps businesses looking to expand or relocate, was sniffing around the South on behalf of an unnamed manufacturer. The consultant, Michael Press, was an old hand in the tax-incentive game. In the 1980s, advising the New York City mayor Ed Koch, he wrote many of the incentives that Amazon recently claimed in its ill-fated bid to build a headquarters in Long Island City. When Press was hired to find a Remington factory, he did what he always did, sending letters to multiple states soliciting bids, inciting competition without disclosing his client. Press had learned that if workers at a company’s existing plants heard a new one was being sought, they would panic about the impending layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;By choosing to place Remington in a Southern state, Press was acknowledging how much the gun business had transformed. Historically, gun makers operated in the North, in New England’s “Gun Valley” or, like Remington, in upstate New York. Smith &amp;amp; Wesson and Colt were established in the 1850s by businessmen in Massachusetts and Connecticut, respectively. During the Civil War, arsenals in Massachusetts furnished huge quantities of firearms to the Union Army. But social mores had changed. The year that Michael Press sent his letters, New York passed the SAFE Act, one of the nation’s most stringent gun-control measures. Battle summarized to me the message the law sent to gunmakers: “If you like guns,” he said, “then you need to go somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There was a secondary benefit. Composed entirely of “right to work” states, the South allowed employees in unionized shops to opt out of paying dues, effectively guaranteeing that any union encountered by Remington would be worse-funded, and therefore less powerful, than a counterpart in the North. At Remington’s factory in Ilion, N.Y., employees had health care and long-term contracts thanks to the United Mine Workers of America. They were difficult to fire, and they stuck together. In some cases, multiple generations of men in the same family had worked on the line. “That union,” a former Remington executive told me disdainfully, “had them by the balls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;If Press had every reason to send his client south, though, he lacked any special affection for Huntsville. For one thing, he explained to me, the airport had a shortage of worthwhile direct flights. For another, the technical labor pool was limited compared with those of larger cities. Press fine-tuned his list, disclosed the name of his client, and flew to Huntsville for a series of meetings, still skeptical. Across the table sat Battle, the head of the Chamber of Commerce and the state’s economic-development director. They flipped their cards one by one. The governor’s office would give Remington a significant abatement of their income tax for 10 years. The Tennessee Valley Authority would provide discounted electricity. Alabama Industrial Development Training, a state agency, would train Remington’s workers free, as it had done for 800,000 others at big-name companies in Alabama, like Boeing, Raytheon and Mercedes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Then Battle flipped the fourth ace: He agreed to purchase and renovate the former Chrysler factory in Huntsville for $12.5 million and give it to Remington rent-free. Press could scarcely believe his good fortune. “It is hard to think of a deal that is better than the Remington deal from the perspective of the company,” he told me. “And I’ve done easily 200.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In exchange for tens of millions in incentives, Remington had only to commit to a few terms, laid out in a fat document called a development agreement. First, it had to hire enough employees every year so that, in 2021, it would have a local work force of 1,868. Second, starting immediately, it had to pay those employees a minimum average hourly wage of $19.50, rising to $20.19 in 2017. All parties signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Private-equity firms typically replace existing managers and install handpicked lieutenants. At Remington, George Kollitides was made chief executive in 2012. A Cerberus managing director until that year, Kollitides was a private-equity star and a fixture in New York philanthropy circles. He received his M.B.A. from Columbia in the late 1990s and, like Feinberg, was a firearms enthusiast. (Kollitides declined to comment for this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Kollitides spent much of 2013 and 2014 zigzagging across the country in Remington’s Piaggio turboprop. Handsome and charming, he persuaded a number of sought-after executives to relocate to Huntsville. “George picked me up in the plane in New Hampshire,” said Ginger Chandler, a former Smith &amp;amp; Wesson executive who served as senior vice president of new-product development at Remington from 2014 to 2017. “He brought me to Huntsville, and he showed me the engineering lab,” she said. “That’s how he convinced me. For an engineer in the gun industry, these facilities were superior to everyone else’s, except maybe Sig Sauer’s. George convinced me that they had a dream in Huntsville, and I believed him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The dream was lofty and ambitious, and Huntsville was only a piece of it. Cerberus had been trying for years to assemble a dominant American gun company. First, in 2006, it purchased Bushmaster, known for its AR-15-style rifles. Then it paid $118 million in cash for Remington and assumed the company’s debt. Other acquisitions followed, until by 2013, 18 businesses were rolled up together under Cerberus’s roof. One of Kollitides’s jobs was to oversee the necessary layoffs. In Ilion, where Remington has operated for 191 years on the same site — unfinished weapons had to travel from one brick building to the next — 231 people lost their jobs. There were 160 layoffs at Montana Rifleman in Kalispell, Mont. The Advanced Armament Corporation, a manufacturer of suppressors and silencers, closed its plant in Georgia, and 68 people were let go from D.P.M.S. Panther Arms in St. Cloud, Minn.; 65 from Para USA in Pineville, N.C. What remained was to increase profit margins by combining all these scattered production lines into a single megafactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;As Chandler flew with Kollitides on the plane from New Hampshire, there was every indication that success awaited them below. When Cerberus bought Remington, the company was earning $500 million a year in revenue. In 2014, it earned $939 million. Guns sales are driven by anti-gun rhetoric; a popular joke in the industry is that Barack Obama was the greatest gun salesman of all time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/regulation/248950-gun-production-has-doubled-under-obama&quot;&gt;The numbers bear this out&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, the year following his second electoral victory, American gun companies produced 10,844,792 firearms, 222 percent more than they produced in the year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2015, expecting another Democrat in the White House, many manufacturers thought the party would continue, stoked by a combination of gun-control rhetoric and the right-wing media’s confiscation conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There was, however, a hidden, vaguely mysterious quirk of the company’s finances. In 2012, more or less in the middle of the best climate for gun makers in a generation, America’s oldest continually operating manufacturer abruptly, and for no easily discernible reason, borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars. When the company came to Alabama, it owed $828 million to its creditors. While this number, compared with the company’s earnings, represented a comfortable ratio on the balance sheet, it was nonetheless curious. The debt could conceivably have been explained by the cost of opening a new factory were it not for the fact that Remington got its factory free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last fall,&lt;/strong&gt; a former Remington executive, who asked that his name not be used for fear of a backlash, opened the door to his house in Huntsville and beckoned me into his study, where we sat on either side of a fireplace. A four-volume edition of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” bound in dark green leather sat on the mantle, next to Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States” and a copy of the United States Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I had met the executive in a bar in Huntsville, where I was looking for a different Remington executive, one who ultimately refused an interview because I couldn’t satisfy his condition of getting a prominent American war journalist to send him a personal email. This one told me he would talk if I showed up at his house the next morning with a Dunkin’ Donuts pumpkin latte, which I now set in front of him on his Oriental rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He was hired, the executive explained, as the plant was coming online, and he was tasked with wrangling together some scattered acquisitions. The business was, according to him, “in shambles.” It seemed that the companies Cerberus had moved to Alabama had been “bought and forgot.” He explained that he was “a realist” about business, a game in which not everyone gets “a shiny rose at the end,” but even so he sensed that something had gone deeply wrong. Executives were fired at a fast clip. Line employees came and went. Parts piled up on the factory floor. Most worrying, Cerberus, which was trying to integrate disparate brands — the father-son pastoralism of Remington with the urban-militia aesthetic of AAC, for instance — seemed to him miserly when it came to marketing. “The decisions were all about: Where can I save another dime?” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Despite all this frenzy, he was certain that Cerberus had somehow made a great deal of money on Remington even before opening the Huntsville factory. According to him, Cerberus had made “hundreds of millions of dollars” almost immediately. “They pulled out all that money up front, took as much cash as they could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“How?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He squinted cryptically. “They get their money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I realized he didn’t know. I went back and reread Remington’s public filings. It was obvious when the debt appeared, in 2012. What wasn’t clear was where the money went. I showed the filings to a professor of finance. He said it looked as if Cerberus had wound up in debt to itself. “Seems like they did something stupid,” he said. “But that can’t be right, because they’re not stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I asked Gustavo Schwed, a professor of private equity at New York University who spent 24 years in the industry, to help me review the documents. Schwed pored over the many years of financial data and located two separate debt transactions, one of which was so esoteric I would never even have known to look for it. Together, these transactions explained not just the mysterious 2012 loan but, indirectly, the way the deal finally unraveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In order to buy Remington, Cerberus, as most private-equity firms would, created a new entity, a holding company. Instead of Cerberus buying a gun company, Cerberus put money into the holding company, and the holding company bought Remington. The entities were related but — and this was crucial — each could borrow money independently. In 2010, Cerberus had the holding company borrow $225 million from an undisclosed group of lenders, most likely hedge funds. Because this loan was risky — the lenders would be paid only if Remington made a lot of money or was sold — the holding company offered a generous interest rate of around 11 percent, much higher than a typical corporate loan. When the interest payments were due, the holding company paid them not in cash but with paid-in-kind notes, that is, with more debt. These are known as PIK notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The holding company now had $225 million in borrowed cash. Cerberus, meanwhile, owned most of the shares of the holding company’s stock, basically slips of paper they acquired when they created the holding company. The handoff happened next: The holding company spent most of the $225 million buying back its own stock, effectively transferring all the borrowed cash to Cerberus. Cerberus would keep that money no matter what. Meanwhile Remington continued rolling along as though nothing had happened, because Remington itself was not responsible for the holding company’s debt. Remington was just an “operating company” that the holding company owned, something that allowed the holding company to borrow money, the way you would take a necklace to a pawnshop. These were garden-variety maneuvers in a private-equity buyout. In the trade, this is called “financial engineering.” People get degrees in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In April 2012, Cerberus did something fateful, which probably seemed smart at the time. It had Remington borrow hundreds of millions of dollars and use it to buy the holding company’s debt, effectively transferring responsibility for the principal and the interest payments onto Remington. America’s oldest gun company now owed the money that Cerberus had used to pay itself back for having bought the company in the first place. There were plenty of sensible reasons to do this. Gun sales were high, and the debt that Remington took out was cheaper to service than the paid-in-kind debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But there was a catch. Because the operating company borrowed the money with a normal loan — and not with PIK notes — interest payments were required in cash. Suddenly Remington was carrying hundreds of millions of dollars in debt that, if it could not be paid, would cause the business to go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;By the time the factory opened in Huntsville, the various players stood in vastly different positions. The private-equity firm had made back its initial investment and was playing with house money. Remington owed hundreds of millions that it hadn’t borrowed. And its workers, urgently, had to make a lot of guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntsville is a&lt;/strong&gt; de facto segregated city. Pastor T.C. Johnson, of St. Luke Missionary Baptist Church, recounted to me how while he was in the Army in the early 1990s, real estate agents didn’t show him houses in South Huntsville, the white side of town. He was unaware South Huntsville existed until some of his Army subordinates, who were white, bought homes there. Since 1965 Huntsville’s schools have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/desegregation-orders&quot;&gt;under a federal desegregation order&lt;/a&gt;, which compels school districts to remedy race-based inequality. Johnson’s oldest son attended Mae Jemison High, a predominantly black school that the state classified as failing. White students at nearby schools “were so far ahead of my child it was almost sickening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Johnson’s experience was of a piece with the racial hierarchy in Huntsville. Blacks make up 31 percent of the city’s population but make up 16 percent of its police force. Unlike Birmingham and Mobile, there has never been a black mayor in Huntsville. Though blacks, like all Huntsvillians, paid the taxes that supported lucrative incentive packages, they seldom reaped the rewards of the best-paying jobs. This reality was of course not felt by whites, Johnson said. For whites, “that’s just the way it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Remington factory was housed in a gray building the size of 14 football fields set back behind fencing topped with razor wire. Inside, the building was divided in half, the production line on the left and the administrative and engineering offices on the right, along with a classroom set up by the state agency that provides free worker training for private businesses. Classes for new hires were held three days a week, every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;About a year after the factory opened, leaders in Huntsville’s black community, including Johnson, began to hear reports from inside. Johnson was disappointed but not surprised to learn from his parishioners that on the Remington line, the usual racial divisions manifested. Most of the line workers were black, whereas most of the managers and engineers were white. Though the company was supposed to be hiring hundreds of people, workers said that the line appeared suspiciously sparse. In addition, though the jobs had been advertised at $19.50 an hour in newspaper columns and Facebook posts — as they should have been, per the development agreement — no one seemed to be earning anything close to $19.50. Johnson, along with the president of the Huntsville N.A.A.C.P. chapter at the time, the Rev. Robert Shanklin, invited a union organizer from the United Mine Workers of America, the same union that organized Remington’s Ilion plant, to use its church facilities and offices as necessary in order to hold clandestine meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The organizer arrived in Huntsville in 2016. He was born in Birmingham and spent most of his career organizing throughout the South. As a result, he tended to be suspicious of Southern bosses — “I have a warped mind when it comes to Alabama,” he told me — and he expected an oppositional management at Remington. But another obstacle surprised him. From week to week, in Johnson’s church or Shanklin’s N.A.A.C.P. office, the organizer rarely saw the same face twice. It seemed to Shanklin that in order to prevent unionization, the factory was exchanging its full-time workers for temps, who came and went rapidly, never sticking around long enough to have a stake. (Remington declined to comment for this article.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The presence of the temp workers, who were exempt from the minimum average hourly wage in the development agreement, also served as a cautionary tale, a reminder of how much lower you could sink if you raised trouble. Temps started at $9.20 an hour with no benefits. Full-time workers, for their part, were often unaware that the tax-incentive package might entitle them to higher wages than they were receiving. And when they did realize, they were unsure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;While I was in Huntsville, Remington employees told me that if they spoke to me for this article, they would be fired. One woman, a line worker, told me over the phone: “These people, they have ways of finding out if you talked. I talk to you, no ifs, ands or buts, I’m gone. It makes us feel they have something to hide. But we keep our mouths shut. Clock in, clock out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I eventually met a former employee, who asked to be identified by her first initial, D., and agreed to talk about her experience at Remington. D. started working full time on the Remington line in August 2015. She was 43 and divorced and moved to Alabama more than a decade earlier from Michigan, along with her 17-year-old son. In 2014 she was earning $10 an hour as a housekeeper at a hospital, but she left for a job at Remington after seeing a newspaper article in which the company promised a minimum average hourly wage of $19.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After taking her two-week course at A.I.D.T., D. started work. She was assigned to a boxing station, which was not on an assembly line but at a static counter where the workers stood side by side. The job was boring. She received the guns — they were long guns, for hunting — placed them in boxes, then weighed the boxes on a digital scale. If the scale displayed a red light, that meant D. had missed a part. When she opened her first paycheck, she saw that she was earning $12.36 an hour — gross. After taxes and benefits, her take-home pay amounted to $353.70 a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After two years, according to paystubs that D. shared with me, she was earning $14.16 an hour. She decided to move into a better apartment in North Huntsville, a two-bedroom with a linoleum square cut out of gray carpeting for a welcome mat. Rent was $675. She bought a Dodge Avenger and a Ruger .380 for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Then, in 2016, D. slipped on a metal pole that a maintenance worker had left outside the factory, grabbed the fence with her right hand to break her fall and felt a muscle tear in her wrist. After missing several days for a second surgery, she says she was called into the office of her supervisor, told that she had missed too much work and fired, three years to the day after she started. As the union effort had fizzled, there was no one she could appeal to for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We were sitting in her apartment last October when her cellphone rang. “Tracir Financial’s calling,” she said. “’Cause I owe on the car.” She pressed decline. The fingers of her left hand returned to her right wrist and massaged it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Over the winter, facing several months of back rent and payments on the Dodge, D. ran out of cash. One morning she woke up to find her car had been repossessed. Bankruptcy offered the only way out, and she filed her petition three weeks before Christmas. Just before the New Year, she was hired by the private-security firm Securitas. She was assigned to the Toyota factory. For the first hour of the day, she would stand outside in her jacket and check employees’ IDs as they arrived. Then she patrolled the parking lot in a company car. The job pays $10 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the 2016&lt;/strong&gt; election, researchers at Cerberus saw an omen in their data. Applications through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which are known as “NIC checks,” were dropping by double-digit percentages. A plunge in NIC checks foreshadows a corresponding plunge in gun sales, which is what happened in the months that followed. Remington’s profit slid toward zero. The debt, meanwhile, was racing upward, like a flame licking a fuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;For Cerberus’s executives, the predicament was like being bitten by a trusted pet. Cerberus has a habit of hiring power brokers from the United States government, many of them prominent Republicans. The former vice president Dan Quayle became chairman of Cerberus Global Investments in 1999; the former Treasury secretary John W. Snow joined Cerberus seven years later. The Republican donor William Richter is a founder. Since May 2018, Feinberg has been a member of Trump’s Intelligence Advisory Board, an independent entity created to advise the president on national-security matters. But if Obama was the best, Trump was proving to be the worst gun salesman of all time. Magnifying his negative impact, gun makers had already ramped up production ahead of Hillary Clinton’s expected victory: In 2017 the market was choked with surplus product, and Trump’s Second Amendment enthusiasm was dousing any hope of a panic buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Remington executives arranged a meeting with their creditors. They calmly explained the situation. Remington had been loaded with debt; now it couldn’t pay the interest. After listening politely, the banks made a proposal: They would exchange the money they were owed for an ownership stake in Remington, a so-called Chapter 11 bankruptcy or “debt-for-equity swap.” This arrangement would allow Remington to stay running, albeit under distant ownership, until a plan could be drawn up for its future, such as a sale or a liquidation of assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In March, Remington announced that it would lay off about 200 employees between its Ilion and Huntsville factories. Shortly after that, the state of Alabama, in a routine payroll audit, found that Remington had missed its hiring targets: Only 450 people were working at the plant at the beginning of 2018, as opposed to the 680 promised in the development agreement. In response, the county and state revoked a number of their tax incentives and demanded the return of $500,000. Remington, not Cerberus, will be responsible for the sum. By the time the state finished its audit, the private-equity firm had long since exited the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A source told me that Cerberus executives were disappointed in the way the Remington transaction turned out; you never want your companies to end up in bankruptcy. Even so, for the firm, at least, the decade-long saga had been profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Paying for Open Source Contributions</title>
<link>https://formidable.com/blog/2019/sauce-program/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://formidable.com/blog/2019/sauce-program/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Formidable, open source is at the heart of everything we do. We help our clients build mission-critical systems using open source technologies like React, Node, GraphQL, and dozens of others. In return we contribute back to these projects, and give our engineers dedicated time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://formidable.com/blog/2019/oss-maintenance/&quot;&gt;maintain more than 70 of our own open source projects&lt;/a&gt; that others can build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently we’ve come to realize this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When push comes to shove, our clients take first priority, and there’s only so many hours in a work day (eight, to be exact). This means that some people are able to contribute more than others depending on their workload, or some may be able to do more in quieter periods and then have to juggle their maintainer responsibilities when things get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side effect of building a company culture around OSS is that the kind of people who gravitate to work at Formidable are passionate about their open source work, and won’t stop contributing when they clock out at 5 pm. We need to acknowledge that most of the meaningful progress in open source communities happens outside of office hours, and if we truly value the open source ecosystem and believe that the work we do has a positive impact, we need to recognize and reward people for this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Sauce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last nine months we’ve experimented with paying our employees for any open source contributions to any project they do on their free time, no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this program Sauce, and here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pay our employees $20/hr for contributions to OSS and tech communities, whether it’s a third-party library we use in our work like React, Next.js, or styled-components; one of our own OSS projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/&quot;&gt;Spectacle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/&quot;&gt;Urql&lt;/a&gt;; or even a personal hack project purely for fun and learning, as long as it’s released under an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses&quot;&gt;OSI license&lt;/a&gt;. Contributions can be code, documentation, design work, pull request reviews, issue triage, community management, or really anything that the individual thinks counts as a contribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we’ve expanded the definition of contributing to include any social impact work within the field of technology, whether it’s teaching children to code at your kid’s school, speaking at your local meetup, or volunteering at a bootcamp for underrepresented minorities in the industry. This makes the Sauce program available to those who want to give back to the community, but don’t feel OSS is their preferred medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trial period, &lt;strong&gt;42% of all Formidables&lt;/strong&gt; (and half of our engineering staff) have been paid for contributions to &lt;strong&gt;55 different OSS projects and local mentorship communities&lt;/strong&gt;. Our employees have fixed critical bugs in code we use every day, launched new OSS projects, had a lot of fun, and learned a ton!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dolla dolla bill y'all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that nominal compensation isn’t the most effective incentive to get people to do things, and compared to engineer salaries in our US and UK tech hubs, $20/hr isn’t exactly a windfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intentional. We don’t want people to log on after hours to earn money. Instead, we think of the Sauce bonus as a recognition of the work people want to do anyway, and the compensation is aimed to be meaningful enough to do something fun with, but not so high that it would skew their priorities to stare at their computer screens instead of spending time with their hobbies, families, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Sauce bonus, you can grab a free coffee and respond to a couple of issues, treat yourself to a cocktail while reviewing a PR, earn a nice meal by fixing a bug, buy yourself a Nintendo Switch to wind down after implementing a new feature to an existing project, or fund a weekend getaway with your partner by launching a new library that solves a previously unaddressed problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping the dollar amount reasonable, we can also ensure that the program is sustainable. Even if every single Formidable employee spent all their evenings contributing to open source, we could afford it in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Please, steal this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is working well for us, and after an initial trial period, we’ve now made the Sauce bonus a permanent perk for all Formidable employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We foresee Sauce playing a part in the personal development and employment satisfaction of our team, but we are far more excited about the good work we can support them to do in OSS and broader tech communities. We also see Sauce motivating people to work on their passion projects, encouraging them to experiment with new technologies to support their career growth, and pass on learnings to the benefit of our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think what we’re doing with Sauce is a good idea, feel free to start your own OSS sponsorship program at your company, or forward this article to your manager with a wink emoji! Or, you could always &lt;a href=&quot;https://formidable.com/careers/&quot;&gt;just become a Formidable&lt;/a&gt; 😉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Sauce itself is heavily inspired (both in name and concept) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiceprogram.org&quot;&gt;Spice Program&lt;/a&gt;, a similar social impact initiative pioneered by my former employer Futurice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, please fork this idea and make it your own. And as always, we’d love to hear your feedback over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FormidableLabs&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reply-to&lt;/em&gt;: Jakub Jelinek &amp;lt;jakub at redhat dot com&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
We are proud to announce the next, major release of the
GNU Compiler Collection.

If you want to boost your software with a fresh new compiler,
with new language features, various new optimizations,
improvements to old optimizations, GCC 9.1 is here for you!

GCC 9.1 is a major release containing substantial new
functionality not available in GCC 9.x or previous GCC releases.

In this release C++17 support is no longer marked experimental. The
C++ front-end implements the full C++17 language (already previous GCC
major version implemented that) and the C++ standard library support is
almost complete. The C++ front-end and library also have numerous further
C++2a draft features [1].  GCC has a new front-end for the D language.
GCC 9.1 has newly partial OpenMP 5.0 support and almost
complete OpenACC 2.5 support.

On the optimization side, the link time and inter-procedural optimizations
have been made more scalable [2].

There have been various usability improvements in GCC diagnostics and GCC 9.1
features various new warnings [3].

Some code that compiled successfully with older GCC versions might require
source changes, see &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/porting_to.html&quot;&gt;http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/porting_to.html&lt;/a&gt; for
details.

See

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9/changes.html&quot;&gt;https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9/changes.html&lt;/a&gt;

for more information about changes in GCC 9.1.

This release is available from the FTP servers listed here:

 &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html&quot;&gt;http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html&lt;/a&gt;

The release is in gcc/gcc-9.1.0/ subdirectory.

If you encounter difficulties using GCC 9.1, please do not contact me
directly.  Instead, please visit &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://gcc.gnu.org&quot;&gt;http://gcc.gnu.org&lt;/a&gt; for information about
getting help.

Driving a leading free software project such as GNU Compiler Collection
would not be possible without support from its many contributors.
Not to only mention its developers but especially its regular testers
and users which contribute to its high quality.  The list of individuals
is too large to thank individually!

Please consider a donation to the GNU Toolchain Fund to support the
continued development of GCC!

<title>Common mistakes in PostgreSQL</title>
<link>https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A short list of common mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_SQL_ASCII&quot;&gt;Don't use SQL_ASCII&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the name suggests that this encoding is in some meaningful way related to ASCII, it is not. Instead, it simply forbids the use of NUL bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &lt;code&gt;SQL_ASCII&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;no conversions&quot; for the purpose of all encoding conversion functions. That is to say, the original bytes are simply treated as being in the new encoding, subject to validity checks, without any regard for what they mean. Unless extreme care is taken, an &lt;code&gt;SQL_ASCII&lt;/code&gt; database will usually end up storing a mixture of many different encodings with no way to recover the original characters reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your input data is already in a hopeless mixture of unlabelled encodings, such as IRC channel logs or non-MIME-compliant emails, then SQL_ASCII might be useful as a last resort—but consider using &lt;code&gt;bytea&lt;/code&gt; first instead, or whether you could autodetect UTF8 and assume non-UTF8 data is in some specific encoding such as WIN1252.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_psql_-W_or_--password&quot;&gt;Don't use psql -W or --password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use &lt;tt&gt;psql -W&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;psql --password&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_2&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the --password or -W flags will tell &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/reference-client.html&quot;&gt;psql&lt;/a&gt; to prompt you for a password, before trying to connect to the server - so you'll be prompted for a password even if the server doesn't require one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's never required, as if the server does require a password psql will prompt you for one, and it can be very confusing when setting up permissions. If you're connecting with -W to a server configured to allow you access via &lt;tt&gt;peer&lt;/tt&gt; authentication you may think that it's requiring a password when it really isn't. And if the user you're logging in as doesn't have a password set or you enter the wrong password at the prompt you'll still be logged in and think you have the right password - but you won't be able to log in from other clients (that connect via localhost) or when logged in as other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_2&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never, pretty much. It will save a round trip to the server but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_rules&quot;&gt;Don't use rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrule.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;. If you think you want to, use a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-trigger.html&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_3&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules are incredibly powerful, but they don't do what they look like they do. They look like they're some conditional logic, but they actually rewrite a query to modify it or add additional queries to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.rhodiumtoad.org.uk/2010/06/21/the-rule-challenge/&quot;&gt;all non-trivial rules are incorrect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depesz has &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.depesz.com/2010/06/15/to-rule-or-not-to-rule-that-is-the-question/&quot;&gt;more to say&lt;/a&gt; about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_3&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never. While the rewriter is an implementation detail of VIEWs, there is no reason to pry up this cover plate directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_table_inheritance&quot;&gt;Don't use table inheritance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-inheritance.html&quot;&gt;table inheritance&lt;/a&gt;. If you think you want to, use foreign keys instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_4&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table inheritance was a part of a fad wherein the database was closely coupled to object-oriented code. It turned out that coupling things that closely didn't actually produce the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_4&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never …almost. Now that table partitioning is done natively, that common use case for table inheritance has been replaced by a native feature that handles tuple routing, etc., without bespoke code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the very few exceptions would be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables&quot;&gt;temporal_tables&lt;/a&gt; extension if you are in a pinch and want to use that for row versioning in place of a lacking SQL 2011 support. Table inheritance will provide a small shortcut instead of using &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; to get both historical as well as current rows. Even then you ought to be wary of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://clarkdave.net/2015/02/historical-records-with-postgresql-and-temporal-tables-and-sql-2011/#using-inheritance&quot;&gt;caveats&lt;/a&gt; while working with parent table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_NOT_IN&quot;&gt;Don't use NOT IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use &lt;code&gt;NOT IN&lt;/code&gt;, or any combination of &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;NOT (x IN (select…))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you think you wanted &lt;code&gt;NOT IN (select …)&lt;/code&gt; then you should rewrite to use &lt;code&gt;NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_5&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;code&gt;NOT IN&lt;/code&gt; behaves in unexpected ways if there is a null present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;select * from foo where col not in (1,null); -- always returns 0 rows&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;select * from foo where col not in (select x from bar);
  -- returns 0 rows if any value of bar.x is null&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens because &lt;code&gt;col IN (1,null)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if col=1, and &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; otherwise (i.e. it can never return &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;). Since &lt;code&gt;NOT (TRUE)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;NOT (NULL)&lt;/code&gt; is still &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, there is no way that &lt;code&gt;NOT (col IN (1,null))&lt;/code&gt; (which is the same thing as &lt;code&gt;col NOT IN (1,null)&lt;/code&gt;) can return &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Because of point 1 above, &lt;code&gt;NOT IN (SELECT ...)&lt;/code&gt; does not optimize very well. In particular, the planner can't transform it into an anti-join, and so it becomes either a hashed Subplan or a plain Subplan. The hashed subplan is fast, but the planner only allows that plan for small result sets; the plain subplan is &lt;strong&gt;horrifically&lt;/strong&gt; slow (in fact O(N²)). This means that the performance can look good in small-scale tests but then slow down by 5 or more orders of magnitude once a size threshold is crossed; you &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; want this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_5&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOT IN (&lt;em&gt;list,of,values,...&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is mostly safe &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; you might have a null in the list (via a parameter or otherwise). So it's sometimes natural and even advisable to use it when excluding specific constant values from a query result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_upper_case_table_or_column_names&quot;&gt;Don't use upper case table or column names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use NamesLikeThis, use names_like_this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_6&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL folds all names - of tables, columns, functions and everything else - to lower case unless they're &quot;double quoted&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;tt&gt;create table Foo()&lt;/tt&gt; will create a table called &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt&gt;create table &quot;Bar&quot;()&lt;/tt&gt; will create a table called &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These select commands will work: &lt;tt&gt;select * from Foo&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;select * from foo&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;select * from &quot;Bar&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will fail with &quot;no such table&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;select * from &quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;select * from Bar&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;select * from bar&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if you use uppercase characters in your table or column names you have to either &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; double quote them or &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; double quote them. That's annoying enough by hand, but when you start using other tools to access the database, some of which always quote all names and some don't, it gets very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to using a-z, 0-9 and underscore for names and you never have to worry about quoting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_6&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's important that &quot;pretty&quot; names are displaying in report output then you might want to use them. But you can also use column aliases to use lower case names in a table and still get pretty names in the output of a query: &lt;tt&gt;select character_name as &quot;Character Name&quot; from foo&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_BETWEEN_.28especially_with_timestamps.29&quot;&gt;Don't use BETWEEN (especially with timestamps)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_7&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/code&gt; uses a closed-interval comparison: the values of both ends of the specified range are included in the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particular problem with queries of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM blah WHERE timestampcol BETWEEN '2018-06-01' AND '2018-06-08'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will include results where the timestamp is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 2018-06-08 00:00:00.000000, but not timestamps later in that same day. So the query might seem to work, but as soon as you get an entry exactly on midnight, you'll end up double-counting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM blah WHERE timestampcol &amp;gt;= '2018-06-01' AND timestampcol &amp;lt; '2018-06-08'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_7&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/code&gt; is safe for discrete quantities like integers or dates, as long as you remember that both ends of the range are included in the result. But it's a bad habit to get into.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_timestamp_.28without_time_zone.29&quot;&gt;Don't use timestamp (without time zone)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the &lt;tt&gt;timestamp&lt;/tt&gt; type to store timestamps, use &lt;tt&gt;timestamptz&lt;/tt&gt; (also known as &lt;tt&gt;timestamp with time zone&lt;/tt&gt;) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_8&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;timestamptz&lt;/tt&gt; records a single moment in time. Despite what the name says it doesn't store a timestamp, just a point in time described as the number of microseconds since January 1st, 2000 in UTC. You can insert values in any timezone and it'll store the point in time that value describes. By default it will display times in your current timezone, but you can use &lt;tt&gt;at time zone&lt;/tt&gt; to display it in other time zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it stores a point in time it will do the right thing with arithmetic involving timestamps entered in different timezones - including between timestamps from the same location on different sides of a daylight savings time change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;timestamp&lt;/tt&gt; (also known as &lt;tt&gt;timestamp without time zone&lt;/tt&gt;) doesn't do any of that, it just stores a date and time you give it. You can think of it being a picture of a calendar and a clock rather than a point in time. Without additional information - the timezone - you don't know what time it records. Because of that, arithmetic between timestamps from different locations or between timestamps from summer and winter may give the wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if what you want to store is a point in time, rather than a picture of a clock, use timestamptz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://it.toolbox.com/blogs/josh-berkus/zone-of-misunderstanding-092811&quot;&gt;More about timestamptz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_8&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're dealing with timestamps in an abstract way, or just saving and retrieving them from an app, where you aren't going to be doing arithmetic with them then timestamp might be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_timestamp_.28without_time_zone.29_to_store_UTC_times&quot;&gt;Don't use timestamp (without time zone) to store UTC times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing UTC values in a &lt;code&gt;timestamp without time zone&lt;/code&gt; column is, unfortunately, a practice commonly inherited from other databases that lack usable timezone support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;timestamp with time zone&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_9&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there is no way for the database to know that UTC is the intended timezone for the column values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complicates many otherwise useful time calculations. For example, &quot;last midnight in the timezone given by u.timezone&quot; becomes this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;date_trunc('day', now() AT TIME ZONE u.timezone) AT TIME ZONE u.timezone AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &quot;the midnight prior to &lt;code&gt;x.datecol&lt;/code&gt; in u.timezone&quot; becomes this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;date_trunc('day', x.datecol AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE u.timezone)
  AT TIME ZONE u.timezone AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_9&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If compatibility with non-timezone-supporting databases trumps all other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_timetz&quot;&gt;Don't use timetz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the &lt;tt&gt;timetz&lt;/tt&gt; type. You probably want &lt;tt&gt;timestamptz&lt;/tt&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_10&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the manual tells you it's only implemented for SQL compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_10&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_CURRENT_TIME&quot;&gt;Don't use CURRENT_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the &lt;code&gt;CURRENT_TIME&lt;/code&gt; function. Use whichever of these is appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CURRENT_TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;now()&lt;/code&gt; if you want a &lt;code&gt;timestamp with time zone&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOCALTIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; if you want a &lt;code&gt;timestamp without time zone&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CURRENT_DATE&lt;/code&gt; if you want a &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOCALTIME&lt;/code&gt; if you want a &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_11&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It returns a value of type &lt;code&gt;timetz&lt;/code&gt;, for which see the previous entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_11&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_timestamp.280.29_or_timestamptz.280.29&quot;&gt;Don't use timestamp(0) or timestamptz(0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use a precision specification, especially not 0, for timestamp columns or casts to timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;date_trunc('second', blah)&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_12&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it rounds off the fractional part rather than truncating it as everyone would expect. This can cause unexpected issues; consider that when you store &lt;code&gt;now()&lt;/code&gt; into such a column, you might be storing a value half a second in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_12&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_char.28n.29&quot;&gt;Don't use char(n)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the type &lt;tt&gt;char(n)&lt;/tt&gt;. You probably want &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_13&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any string you insert into a &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; field will be padded with spaces to the declared width. That's probably not what you actually want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values of type character are physically padded with spaces to the specified width n, and are stored and displayed that way. However, trailing spaces are treated as semantically insignificant and disregarded when comparing two values of type character. In collations where whitespace is significant, this behavior can produce unexpected results; for example &lt;code&gt;SELECT 'a '::CHAR(2) collate &quot;C&quot; &amp;lt; E'a\n'::CHAR(2)&lt;/code&gt; returns true, even though C locale would consider a space to be greater than a newline. Trailing spaces are removed when converting a character value to one of the other string types. Note that trailing spaces are semantically significant in character varying and text values, and when using pattern matching, that is LIKE and regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should scare you off it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space-padding does waste space, but doesn't make operations on it any faster; in fact the reverse, thanks to the need to strip spaces in many contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that from a storage point of view &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is not a fixed-width type&lt;/strong&gt;. The actual number of bytes varies since characters may take more than one byte, and the stored values are therefore treated as variable-length anyway (even though the space padding is included in the storage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_13&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're porting very, very old software that uses fixed width fields. Or when you read the snippet from the manual above and think &quot;yes, that makes perfect sense and is a good match for my requirements&quot; rather than gibbering and running away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_char.28n.29_even_for_fixed-length_identifiers&quot;&gt;Don't use char(n) even for fixed-length identifiers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people respond to &quot;don't use &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with &quot;but my values must always be exactly N characters long&quot; (e.g. country codes, hashes, or identifiers from some other system). &lt;strong&gt;It is still a bad idea to use &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; even in these cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;, or a domain over text, with &lt;code&gt;CHECK(length(VALUE)=3)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CHECK(VALUE ~ '^[[:alpha:]]{3}$')&lt;/code&gt; or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_14&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; doesn't reject values that are too short, it just silently pads them with spaces. So there's no actual benefit over using &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; with a constraint that checks for the exact length. As a bonus, such a check can also verify that the value is in the correct format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;there is no performance benefit whatsoever to using &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;varchar(n)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact the reverse is true. One particular problem that comes up is that if you try and compare a &lt;code&gt;char(n)&lt;/code&gt; field against a parameter where the driver has explicitly specified a type of &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt;, you may be unexpectedly unable to use an index for the comparison. This can be hard to debug since it doesn't show up on manual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_14&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_varchar.28n.29_by_default&quot;&gt;Don't use varchar(n) by default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the type &lt;tt&gt;varchar(n)&lt;/tt&gt; by default. Consider &lt;tt&gt;varchar&lt;/tt&gt; (without the length limit) or &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_15&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;varchar(n)&lt;/tt&gt; is a variable width text field that will throw an error if you try and insert a string longer than n characters (not bytes) into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;varchar&lt;/tt&gt; (without the &lt;tt&gt;(n)&lt;/tt&gt;) or &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; are similar, but without the length limit. If you insert the same string into the three field types they will take up exactly the same amount of space, and you won't be able to measure any difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what you really need is a text field with an length limit then varchar(n) is great, but if you pick an arbitrary length and choose varchar(20) for a surname field you're risking production errors in the future when Hubert Blaine Wolfe­schlegel­stein­hausen­berger­dorff signs up for your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some databases don't have a type that can hold arbitrary long text, or if they do it's not as convenient or efficient or well-supported as varchar(n). Users from those databases will often use something like &lt;tt&gt;varchar(255)&lt;/tt&gt; when what they really want is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to constrain the value in a field you probably need something more specific than a maximum length - maybe a minimum length too, or a limited set of characters - and a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS&quot;&gt;check constraint&lt;/a&gt; can do all of those things as well as a maximum string length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_15&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to, really. If what you want is a text field that will throw an error if you insert too long a string into it, and you don't want to use an explicit check constraint then varchar(n) is a perfectly good type. Just don't use it automatically without thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Don.27t_use_money&quot;&gt;Don't use money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;money&lt;/tt&gt; data type isn't actually very good for storing monetary values. Numeric, or (rarely) integer may be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Why_not.3F_16&quot;&gt;Why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/20130328092819.237c0106@imp#20130328092819.237c0106@imp&quot;&gt;lots of reasons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fixed-point type, implemented as a machine int, so arithmetic with it is fast. But it doesn't handle fractions of a cent (or equivalents in other currencies), it's rounding behaviour is probably not what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't store a currency with the value, rather assuming that all money columns contain the currency specified by the database's &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LC-MONETARY&quot;&gt;lc_monetary&lt;/a&gt; locale setting. If you change the lc_monetary setting for any reason, all money columns will contain the wrong value. That means that if you insert '$10.00' while lc_monetary is set to 'en_US.UTF-8' the value you retrieve may be '10,00 Lei' or '¥1,000' if lc_monetary is changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing a value as a numeric, possibly with the currency being used in an adjacent column, might be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;When_should_you.3F_16&quot;&gt;When should you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're only working in a single currency, aren't dealing with fractional cents and are only doing addition and subtraction then money might be the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
