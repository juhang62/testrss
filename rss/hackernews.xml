<title>How to speed up the Rust compiler in 2018</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;18 months ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2016/10/14/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler/&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2016/11/23/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more/&quot;&gt;some work&lt;/a&gt; I did to speed up the Rust compiler (rustc). I’ve recently taken this work up again. Also, in the meantime rustc’s build system has been replaced and its benchmark suite has been overhauled. So it’s a good time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps for getting the rustc code haven’t changed. First, I fork the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/&quot;&gt;main Rust repository&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. Then I make two local clones: a base clone that I won’t modify, which serves as a stable comparison point (rust0), and a second clone where I make my modifications (rust1). I use commands something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
user=nnethercote
for r in rust0 rust1 ; do
  git clone https://github.com/$user/rust $r
  cd $r
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:$user/rust
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building the Rust compiler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiler’s build system is &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.rust-lang.org/x-py.html&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; with many possible invocations and configurations. I’ll cover the absolute minimum information required to understand how I’ve been using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need a &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file, which sits at the root of the repository and dictates the compiler’s configuration. I used the provided &lt;code&gt;config.toml.example&lt;/code&gt; as a starting point, cut it down a lot, and ended up with the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[llvm]
optimize = true
release-debuginfo = true
assertions = false

[rust]
optimize = true
codegen-units = 1
debug-assertions = false
debuginfo = true
debuginfo-lines = true
use-jemalloc = false
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that some of these lines just restate defaults, but I figure it doesn’t hurt to be explicit. This configuration has the following characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It results in the production of a fully optimized rustc, which is important for profiling. The exception to this is that I disable jemalloc, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html&quot;&gt;DHAT&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t work when jemalloc is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has maximal debug info present, which ensures that profiles are as detailed as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building rustc can be confusing, particularly because of the multiple compiler stages and the terminology around them. Here is the command I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
./x.py build --stage 2 src/rustc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces a stage 2 compiler that can handle procedural macros and so is suitable for profiling the benchmark suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The benchmark suite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rustc’s benchmark suite is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf&quot;&gt;rustc-perf&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;collector: The 24 benchmark programs, 14 of which are “real” code (i.e. crates used in real applications), and 10 of which are toy programs or stress test microbenchmarks. Also, the harness code that runs and measures them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;site: Code for displaying measurements as a website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test harness is very thorough. For each benchmark, it measures Debug, Opt, and Check (no code generation) invocations. Furthermore, within each of those categories, it does five or more runs, including a normal build and various kinds of incremental builds. A full benchmarking run measures over 400 invocations of rustc. Note however that only the compilation of the final crate is measured in each benchmark; compilation of dependent crates is not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rustc-perf was created primarily for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://perf.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;perf.rust-lang.org&lt;/a&gt; site, which tracks rustc’s performance over time. I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/pull/207&quot;&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt; it so it could be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector&quot;&gt;compare two builds of rustc on a local machine&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fundamental operation when optimizing. This can be done by running the suite and site locally and navigating to the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html&quot;&gt;“compare” page&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/compare/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3176&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3176&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of rustc-perf's compare page&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height=&quot;526&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare.png 667w, https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare-252x199.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare-600x473.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that rustc-perf uses perf-stat for its measurements, so the benchmarking functionality currently only works on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/pull/209&quot;&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; rustc-perf so the benchmarks can be run under a profiler. I implemented support for perf-record, Cachegrind, and DHAT, because they are the profilers that I am most familiar with; it isn’t hard to add support for other profilers (including non-Linux ones). The advantage of integrating support for a profiler intto rustc-perf is that it gets the profiler invocations underneath the Cargo invocations, ensuring that the right rustc invocations are measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the improvements I’ve made to rustc over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49993&quot;&gt;#49993&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that derived methods for the &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; type were taking up significant time. This PR changed the ‘#’ counts in raw &lt;code&gt;Lit&lt;/code&gt; variants from &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt;, which reduced the size of &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; from 32 to 24 bytes, speeding up some of the runs for coercions and html5ever by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50051&quot;&gt;#50051&lt;/a&gt;: Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Option::ok_or&lt;/code&gt; function transforms an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; value into a &lt;code&gt;Result&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a bit of a footgun… as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or&quot;&gt;docs say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments passed to &lt;code&gt;ok_or&lt;/code&gt; are eagerly evaluated; if you are passing the result of a function call, it is recommended to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or_else&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ok_or_else&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is lazily evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAT’s output showed that one hot allocation site involved the creation of a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; while getting the value of the &lt;code&gt;MIRI_BACKTRACE&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. This seemed to me like a strange thing to be happening frequently, and it turns out that it was at the end of a chain of calls that were only needed in the (rare) error case of an &lt;code&gt;ok_or&lt;/code&gt; call. This PR changed the code to use a trivial closure with &lt;code&gt;ok_or_else&lt;/code&gt;, speeding up runs for a lot of benchmarks, the best by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50052&quot;&gt;#50052&lt;/a&gt;: DHAT’s output showed that the &lt;code&gt;char_lit&lt;/code&gt; function, which parses “\u{…}” literals, was doing a lot of allocations while stripping out ‘_’ chars. This PR avoided that allocation, speeding up various runs — particularly ones for regex, futures, clap, coercions, hyper, and encoding — the best by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50106&quot;&gt;#50106&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that the &lt;code&gt;nearest_common_ancestor&lt;/code&gt; function, which computes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor&quot;&gt;lowest common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of two nodes in a scope tree, was very hot. The algorithm in use constructed the full scope chain for each node, and then worked backward from the end of the two scope chains until a difference was found. This is a reasonable algorithm in many circumstances, but some ad hoc instrumentation (&lt;code&gt;eprintln!&lt;/code&gt; statements plus some simple post-processing) showed that the scope chains usually only differ by a handful of elements at the front and then have very long common tails, with dozens or even hundreds of elements. This PR switched to a different algorithm that looks for differences from the front of the scope chain, speeding up runs for many benchmarks, the best by 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50174&quot;&gt;#50174&lt;/a&gt;: By default, Rust’s &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; use a hash function that is very high quality but also very slow. Therefore, the Rust compiler internally uses different types, &lt;code&gt;FxHashSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FxHashMap&lt;/code&gt;, which are identical to the standard ones except they use a much faster hash function. Unfortunately, it’s easy to forget about them and use the standard hash tables instead. Cachegrind’s output showed that the default hash function code (SipHash) was executed a lot, and that one particularly hot hash table (the symbol interner) was using &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;. This PR (trivially) changed that table to an &lt;code&gt;FxHashMap&lt;/code&gt;, speeding up runs for numerous benchmarks, the best by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50240&quot;&gt;#50240&lt;/a&gt;: Some of Rust’s standard containers, such as &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;, have the nice property that by default they don’t allocate until an element is inserted. This is good because it’s surprising how often such containers are created but never inserted into. DHAT’s output showed that such behaviour would also help with a couple of the compiler’s uses of BTreeMap. I tried and failed to implement this behaviour directly in BTreeMap; according to Gankro, “BTreeMap is some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7f3444e1baf0d335b4bf379f845dbc28cdd0509c/src/liballoc/btree/node.rs#L257-L280&quot;&gt;most complex unsafe code in libstd” &lt;/a&gt;and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gankro/status/989683166658121728&quot;&gt;I just scared off a grizzled firefox dev explaining it&lt;/a&gt;“! Instead this PR introduced a thin wrapper type (&lt;code&gt;LazyBTreeMap)&lt;/code&gt; around &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; and used it in the handful of relevant places within the compiler, speeding up the runs for several benchmarks, the best by 3%. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50266&quot;&gt;#50266&lt;/a&gt; is open to do the general fix for &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt;, whereupon &lt;code&gt;LazyBTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; will be able to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50246&quot;&gt;#50246&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that a function named &lt;code&gt;dump_allocs&lt;/code&gt; was hot for some benchmarks. This sounded to me like a logging or debugging function of some kind, and investigation confirmed that it was traversing data structures in order to build up strings that went unused in the standard case where logging is disabled. This PR (trivially) changed this function and a couple of related ones to be no-ops if logging is disabled, speeding up runs for coercions, tuple-stress, html5ever, and encoding, the best by almost 15%! This shows how &lt;em&gt;not doing unclever things&lt;/em&gt; is often as important as &lt;em&gt;doing clever things&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to optimizing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s worth noting that I also made three or four optimization attempts that didn’t work out — where I made a change that seemed like it should help, based on profiling data, but the effect was negligible. Success isn’t guaranteed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the PRs mentioned above (except for the aborted &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; change) involved small, simple changes to the Rust compiler’s code. I’m not a rustc expert, but I do know how to use a couple of profilers well, and I’ve been able to make a difference. I’m sure there are more improvements of this nature to be made, and I encourage other people to try profiling rustc with their favourite profilers to see what they can find. This is valuable because rustc’s speed is something that Rust users often complain about. And it’s fun, if you like that sort of thing 🙂  I’m happy to help people, and the members of the #rustc IRC channel are very friendly and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, in a lot of cases, especially for opt builds, the majority of execution time is within LLVM, which rustc uses for code generation. Speeding up LLVM itself may be difficult, but I hope/suspect there is room for improvement in the way that rustc interacts with LLVM. If anyone has ideas on that front I’d love to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A home-made lithographically-fabricated integrated circuit</title>
<link>http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/#</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to announce the details of my first integrated circuit and share the journey that this project has taken me on over the past year. I hope that my success will inspire others and help start a revolution in home chip fabrication. When I set out on this project I had no idea of what I had gotten myself into, but in the end I learned more than I ever thought I would about physics, chemistry, optics, electronics, and so many other fields. Furthermore, my efforts have only been matched with the most positive feedback and support from the world; I owe a sincere thanks to everyone who has helped me, given me advice, and inspired me on this project. Especially my amazing parents, who not only support and encourage me in any way they can but also give me a space to work in and put up with the electricity costs… Thank you!&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737&quot; src=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-1024x678.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_D7V8343&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; srcset=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-1024x678.jpg 1024w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-300x199.jpg 300w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-768x509.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I present the first home(garage)made lithographically-fabricated integrated circuit – the “Z1” PMOS dual differential amplifier chip. I say “lithographically-fabricated” because Jeri Ellsworth made the first transistors and logic gates (meticulously hand wired with conductive epoxy) and showed the world that this is possible. Inspired by her work, I have demonstrated ICs made by a scalable, industry-standard, photolithographic process. Needless to say, this is the logical step-up from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/fet/&quot;&gt;previous replication of Jeri’s FET fabrication work. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/ic-design-tools-from-verilog-to-mask/&quot;&gt;I designed the Z1 amplifier&lt;/a&gt; looking for a simple chip to test and tweak my process. Layout was done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/&quot;&gt;Magic VLSI&lt;/a&gt; for a 4 mask PMOS process (active/doped area, gate oxide, contact window, and top metal.) PMOS has advantages over NMOS as far as mobile ionic contamination that lends it to being fabricated in a garage. The masks are designed in 16:9 aspect ratio for easy projection.&lt;/p&gt;

Metal&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature (gate) size is approximately 175μm although there are test features as small as 2μm on the chip. Each amplifier section (center and right) contain 3 transistors (2 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_amplifier&quot;&gt;long-tailed differential pair&lt;/a&gt; and one as current source/load resistor) which means a total of 6 FETs on the IC. The left portion of the IC contains resistors, capacitors, diodes, and other test features used to characterize the fabrication process. Each node of the differential pairs is broken out to a separate pin on the lead frame so it can be analyzed and external biasing can be added as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fabrication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 66 individual fabrication steps to make this chip and it takes approximately 12 hours for a full run. I have made Youtube videos covering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCSIGejNT4M&amp;amp;t=1808s&quot;&gt;semiconductor fabrication theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1MCi7FliVY&quot;&gt;discrete MOSFET fabrication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50mm (2″) Si wafers are scored into 5.08 x 3.175mm dies (~16mm^2 area) with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/laser-silicon-wafer-scribing-and-cutting/&quot;&gt;Epilog fiber laser.&lt;/a&gt; This die size is chosen to fit into a Kyocera 24pin DIP carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

50mm N-type wafer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native oxide is stripped off the wafer with a quick dilute HF dip and then they are extensively cleaned in Piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2), RCA 1 (H2O:NH3:H2O2), RCA 2 (H2O:HCL:H2O2), followed by another dilute HF dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field oxide is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleanroom.byu.edu/OxideTimeCalc&quot;&gt;thermally grown&lt;/a&gt; in a water vapor ambient (wet oxidation) to a thickness of 5000-8000Å.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resist pattern is then hard baked and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/sio2-patterning/&quot;&gt;number of other tricks&lt;/a&gt; are used to ensure good resist adhesion and chemical stability during the following HF etch step which transfers that pattern to the oxide layer and opens windows to the bare silicon surface for doping. These regions later become the source/drain of the FETs.&lt;/p&gt;

Doped dies w/ gate etch&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping is then carried out by either solid or liquid source. The solid source is a Boron Nitride disk that is placed in proximity (&amp;lt;2mm) from the wafer in the tube furnace. Alternatively, spin-on liquid sources can be prepared from Phosphoric or Boric acid in water or solvents and doping is carried out in a standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://desertsilicon.com/spin-on-glass-spin-on-dopants-application-procedure/&quot;&gt;pre-deposition/HF dip/drive-in/deglaze process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above mentioned patterning steps are then repeated twice for the gate oxide layer and then the contact layer. The gate oxide must be much thinner (&amp;lt;~750Å) than the field oxide, so the regions between the source/drain are etched away and a thinner oxide is grown there. Then, since the whole wafer has been oxidized during the doping step, contact windows must be etched for the metal layer to make connection with source/drain doped regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1764&quot; src=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;na_1&quot; width=&quot;422&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; srcset=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png 422w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1-300x136.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all the transistors are formed and are ready to be interconnected and broken out to the lead frame. A blanket layer of Aluminum (400-500nm) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/sem-sample-preparation-dc-sputtering/&quot;&gt;sputtered&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/thermal-evaporation-physical-vapor-deposition/&quot;&gt;thermally evaporated&lt;/a&gt; onto the wafer. An alternative would be to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/lift-off-metal-patterning/&quot;&gt;lift-off process&lt;/a&gt; in which the photoresist is patterned first and then metal is deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

Evaporated metal&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal layer is then patterned with photolithography and etched in hot Phosphoric acid to yield the completed IC. The final steps before testing are visual inspection and high temperature annealing of the Aluminum to create ohmic connections.&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8327.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished chip is now ready for packaging and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a wire bonder (accepting donations!) so my testing right now is limited to manually probing the wafer with sharp tweezers or using a flip-chip board (difficult to align) to connect it to a curve tracer. The differential amplifier is also tested empirically in-circuit to verify operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these curves are far from ideal (some of which is due to extra contact resistance/other factors like that) but I would expect things to get better with proper wire bonding. This may also account for some of the die to die variation. This page will be updated with new IV, FET, and a differential amplifier characteristic curves soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thinking of yourself as an insomniac may be a major part of the problem</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/cant-sleep-insomnia-identity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/cant-sleep-insomnia-identity</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ote to publishers: in my view, there’s an unfilled gap in the “wellness” market for a book on how sleep isn’t really that important. In contrast to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/arianna_huffington_how_to_succeed_get_more_sleep&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the message relentlessly promoted&lt;/a&gt; by lifestyle gurus these days, this book would argue that four hours a night is probably fine, that caffeine before bed is no big deal, and that even severe sleep deprivation poses no real risk of poor performance, health troubles or early death. Admittedly, this might raise certain ethical issues, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/tiredness-and-fatigue/Pages/lack-of-sleep-health-risks.aspx&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;that’s not what the science says&lt;/a&gt;. But you know what? Unlike all those other books, this one would &lt;em&gt;help people sleep&lt;/em&gt;. Because take it from an intermittent bad sleeper: there’s nothing more likely to keep an insomniac up at night, or turn a good sleeper into an insomniac, than being told it’s completely essential they drift off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the ironies of insomnia are even worse than that, because there’s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac – having an &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/26/insomnia-identity-misbelieving-youve-got-sleep-problems-can-be-more-harmful-than-actual-lack-of-sleep/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“insomnia identity”&lt;/a&gt;, in the coinage of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sleepresearchproject.ua.edu/about-the-director.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;sleep researcher Kenneth Lichstein&lt;/a&gt; – is a major part of the problem. It’s not just that such a self-image makes it harder to sleep, though doubtless that’s the case. It’s that having an insomnia identity makes life terrible even if, in reality, you’re getting sufficient sleep. In a review of the research published last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717301638&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lichstein concluded&lt;/a&gt; that “non-complaining poor sleepers” – who sleep badly but don’t define themselves as insomniacs – don’t suffer the high blood pressure commonly associated with severe sleeplessness. Meanwhile, “complaining good sleepers” – who get enough shut-eye, but are heavily invested in their alleged insomnia – were essentially as tired, anxious and depressed as those who genuinely didn’t sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the worst part, arguably, is this: with an insomnia identity, seeking help is liable to make things worse. Drag your weary bones to the doctor and she may be willing to prescribe sleeping pills. But apart from the fact that they’re not very effective, and often very addictive, the benefits are likely to be outweighed by the very act of visiting the doctor: by doing so, you’ve doubled down on your insomnia identity, signalling to your subconscious mind that you have an intransigent problem, requiring medical intervention. Reading all this, some chronic insomniacs may protest that I’m making light of their own, far more serious condition, which really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; intransigent. Perhaps. But do bear in mind that’s exactly what someone with a strong insomnia identity would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root of the problem, as Sasha Stephens explains in her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-effortless-sleep-method/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;The Effortless Sleep Method&lt;/a&gt;, is that any external crutch on which you lean – not just pills, but herbal remedies and elaborate bedtime rituals, too – risks further eroding your trust in your ability to fall asleep on your own, and it’s that lack of self-trust that is insomnia’s main cause. (Obviously, don’t stop taking prescription drugs without consulting a doctor.) Few things have helped me as much as following one of Stephens’ many recommendations and training myself to remember, upon waking at 2am, that when I have a terrible night, the next day usually isn’t so bad. Once I’m OK with not getting back to sleep, it’s surprisingly hard to stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Roger Ekirch’s endlessly fascinating 2005 book At Day’s Close, a social history of night-time, argues that pre-industrial people slept in two phases, with an hour awake in between.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>StreetLend.com shuts down, citing GDPR regulations</title>
<link>https://streetlend.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://streetlend.com</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;stylesheet.css&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=500&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;101.35031847134&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's Streetlend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlend.com was a website that helped neighbours and friends lend items to each other. Ladders, drills etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was modern, mobile-friendly and easy to use. Scroll down to see how Streetlend worked, and why it was reluctantly shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders listed hundreds of items, mainly in London. Many friction-free transactions were made, at no charge to lender or borrower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.streetlend.com/img/entry.png&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlend's business model involved affiliation with Amazon. When members searched for an item to borrow, they were also shown items to buy, and Streetlend earnt a cut of the sales revenue. Did it turn a profit? No, sadly not, but running at a loss was fine as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://brightercode.com&quot;&gt;day job&lt;/a&gt; covered the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why shut down the site?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sadness, StreetLend was shut down in April 2018, after five years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the European Union's new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), introduced on 25th May 2018, creates uncertainty and risk that I can't justify taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR threatens website owners with fines of 4% of turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher) if they do not jump through a number of ambiguously-defined hoops. The law, combined with parasitic no-win-no-fee legal firms, puts website owners at risk of vindictive reporting. Young websites and non-profits cannot afford legal teams. Therefore the risk posed by GDPR is unacceptably high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perversely, this new EU law hurts small and ethical startups, but helps reinforce the dominance of Facebook, Google and Twitter, who are able to prepare and defend themselves using established legal teams and cash reserves, and who now face less competition from startups. The EU Cookie Law, EU VAT regulation and now the EU GDPR are all examples of poorly-implemented laws that add complexity and unintended side-effects for businesses within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A brief tour of Streetlend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logging in to Streetlend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlend supported Facebook / LinkedIn / Twitter / Email+Password login. A couple of clicks, and you're in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors see all nearby items for rental as soon as they land on the site (with their permission, the user's location is shared electronically with the site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any nearby friends (or friends of friends) are highlighted on the list of lenders (you'd be surprised how many local people you have a second-degree connection with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.streetlend.com/img/logged-in.png&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlend allowed searching for terms such as &quot;ladder,&quot; and all relevant results e.g. ladders, step-ladders etc would be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.streetlend.com/img/search.png&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listing Items for Lending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was free of charge to list items, and free of charge to borrow items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.streetlend.com/img/my-items.png&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Borrowing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A messaging process initially guided by forms helped borrowers arrange the transaction with lenders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.streetlend.com/img/borrow.png&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlend was created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisbeach&quot;&gt;Chris Beach&lt;/a&gt; as a side project in 2013, using Scala, Play Framework, jQuery, Neo4J and MongoDB. Google Maps provided mapping and location search.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Health dangers of sleep deprivation</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/how-much-sleep-is-enough-sleep-deprivation-health-dangers-a8328126.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/how-much-sleep-is-enough-sleep-deprivation-health-dangers-a8328126.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rocker Warren Zevon is often credited with coining the mantra that’s been embraced by everyone from partying college kids to early-morning exercise evangelists: “You can sleep when you’re dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as Bon Jovi put it, “Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an intoxicating thought, but the truth is that not getting enough sleep is literally killing us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what neuroscientist Matthew Walker, who directs the sleep and neuroimaging lab at UC Berkeley, says in his book, ‘Why We Sleep,’ which was published in October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker has dolled out sleep advice to the NBA, NFL and Pixar, among others. His first book is a deep dive into the latest research on the importance of sleep, as well as a how-to guide for getting better sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He succinctly summed up his overall stance on snoozing for Business Insider: “The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life,” Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that two thirds of adults around the world aren’t getting enough sleep. The World Health Organisation and Walker both recommend about eight hours a night as a good baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker argues that routinely getting only six or seven hours of shut-eye per night can do serious long-term damage to your health, and in some cases even kill you. He insists on a strict eight hours of &quot;sleep opportunity&quot; for himself. That means he's in bed for at least eight hours a night, even if he spends a portion of that time falling asleep and waking up. He says that schedule helps keep him productive, as well as emotionally and physically fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three of the key ways Walker says a lack of sleep can hurt your body and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of sleep puts the immune system at a disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you haven't slept enough, it’s harder for the body to fight off illnesses ranging from the common cold to cancer. Sleep deprivation depletes stores of your “natural killer cells,” a type of lymphocyte (white blood cell) that nix tumor and virus cells. A single 4- or 5-hour night of sleep could lower your body’s &quot;natural killer&quot; cell count by around 70%, Walker says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missing sleep can also put your body on a crash course for chronic disease. Insufficient sleep has been linked to increased instances of Alzheimer's, obesity, stroke, and diabetes. Lack of sleep changes how insulin operates in your body and how quickly your cells absorb sugar. After a week of short sleep nights (say, five or six hours), your doctor could diagnose you with pre-diabetes, Walker says. That means your blood sugar levels are elevated enough that you're on track to become a diabetic. Long-term damage to your heart, blood vessels, and kidneys could already be in motion in such circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that some people, a &quot;sleepless elite&quot; as Walker calls them, are built to survive on less sleep and will sleep just six hours, even in laboratory sleep conditions. Such lucky individuals make up just a fraction of one percent of the population, Walker says, and share a gene (BHLHE41) that's incredibly rare. (If you think you have it, you probably don't.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just an hour of lost sleep can kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker likes to say that &quot;there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people, twice a year.&quot; You probably call it Daylight Saving Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we lose an hour of sleep every spring when the clocks get pushed forward, car accident rates jump. Walker's seen this play out in the lab too — after study participants spent two weeks sleeping for seven hours instead of nine, their reaction times slowed by half a second. That's a long lapse if you're cruising at 60 mph. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has studied car crashes in the US, and found that tired drivers kill about 6,400 people a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks also spike 25% around Daylight Saving Time, since sleep deprivation puts more stress on the heart. Researchers have found that men in Japan who sleep less than six hours a night are 400-500% likelier to have a heart attack than their better-rested counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep debt is carcinogenic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep makes the body a better breeding ground for cancer. Sleepiness is now being blamed for cases of colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. An off-kilter sleep schedule may also give rise to cancer, since it causes melatonin to be suppressed. The World Health Organisation calls night work a &quot;probable carcinogen.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all these factors, scientists warn that hanging on to the idea that you'll sleep when your dead is truly deadly advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sleeping enough, &quot;you will be both dead sooner, and the quality of your (now shorter) life will be significantly worse,&quot;  Walker told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>You are probably not getting enough sleep, and it is killing you</og:title>

<og:description>Rocker Warren Zevon is often credited with coining the mantra that’s been embraced by everyone from partying college kids to early-morning exercise evangelists: “You can sleep when you’re dead.” Or as Bon Jovi put it, “Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead.” It’s an intoxicating thought, but the truth is that not getting enough sleep is literally killing us. That’s what neuroscientist Matthew Walker, who directs the sleep and neuroimaging lab at UC Berkeley, says in his book, ‘Why We Sleep,’ which was published in October 2017.</og:description>

<title>9,096 Stars in the Sky – Is That All?</title>
<link>http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-stars-night-sky-09172014/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-stars-night-sky-09172014/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten thousand stars bedazzle the eye on a dark night. Wait, how many stars in the sky?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_255427944&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Stars-ST.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-255427944&quot; src=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Stars-ST-242x190.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How many stars in the sky can you see from a pitch black sky? Bob King explores this in his informative article.&quot; width=&quot;242&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; srcset=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Stars-ST-242x190.jpg 242w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Stars-ST.jpg 411w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;How many stars in the sky can you see?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go out on a dark night and you'd swear there are thousands of stars in the sky. Too many to count. 10,000 at least. But why guess when someone has already done the counting for you? Astronomer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/dorrit-hoffleit-19072007/?showAll=y&amp;amp;c=y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dorrit Hoffleit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Yale University, well known for her work with variable stars, compiled the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?V/50&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yale Bright Star Catalog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; decades ago. It tabulates every star visible from Earth to magnitude 6.5, the naked eye limit for most of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be in for a surprise when you read it, though. To answer the question, &quot;How many stars in the sky?&quot; The total comes to 9,096 stars visible across the entire sky. Both hemispheres. Since we can only see half the celestial sphere at any moment, we necessarily divide that number by two to arrive at 4,548 stars (give or take depending on the season). And that's from the darkest sky you can imagine. I don't know about you, but that number seems paltry to one's impression of an inky night in the backcountry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the poles, where the north and south polestars are pinned to the zenith and no stars rise or set, the same ~4,500 stars are visible every single clear night of the year. At northern mid-latitudes, the pole star is halfway up in the northern sky, allowing us to peer deeper into the southern realms of the celestial sphere. During the course of a year from latitude 45° north, we see roughly half again as many stars as we do at a particular time on a given evening. That tallies up to approximately 6,800 stars. Still pretty lean, but apparently enough to convey the impression of an intensely starry sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_255427903&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-255427903&quot; src=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Magnitude-scale-mini-ST.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fifty-eight magnitudes of apparent brightness encompass the things that astronomers study, from the glaring Sun to the faintest objects detected with the Hubble Space Telescope. This range is equivalent to a brightness ratio of some 200 billion trillion. -&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; srcset=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Magnitude-scale-mini-ST.jpg 275w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Magnitude-scale-mini-ST-113x113.jpg 113w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Magnitude-scale-mini-ST-190x190.jpg 190w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Why stop at the naked eye? 50-mm binoculars increase the number of stars to about 100,000 while observers using a 3-inch telescope can spy about 5 million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky and Telescope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/MagScale.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;magnitude scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to measure star and planet brightness. Each magnitude is 2.5 times brighter than the one below it. Altair, in Aquila the Eagle, shines at about magnitude +1 which is 2.5 times brighter than a 2nd magnitude star, which is 2.5 times brighter than a 3rd magnitude star, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first magnitude star is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 (about 100) times brighter than a 6th magnitude star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger the magnitude number, the fainter the star. If an object is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bright, it’s assigned a negative magnitude. Sirius, the brightest star sparkles at magnitude –1.4, Jupiter at –2.5, and Venus tops the planets at  –4.4. The Full Moon reaches a magnificent –12.7, bested only by the Sun at –26.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_255427984&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/47833278@N02/15081348717/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-255427984 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-6.5-limit_ST_edited-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A night sky too few of us ever see.&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; srcset=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-6.5-limit_ST_edited-2.jpg 504w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-6.5-limit_ST_edited-2-300x179.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The sky facing south at nightfall in late September from a dark, light-pollution-free site with stars visible to magnitude 6.5, the naked eye limit. Click to enlarge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Stellarium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;While the total number of naked eye stars may seem unimpressive, consider what happens to the sky in and around cities, where most of us live. From the suburbs, the magnitude limit is around +4 for a worldwide total of about 900 stars or &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; that for your location. If we set the city limit at magnitude +2 (stars similar to the Big Dipper in brightness) we're left with just 70 stars worldwide, or 35 stars visible from say, downtown Chicago or Boston.
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_255427985&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/47833278@N02/15267904805/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-255427985 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-2.5-limit_ST_edited-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Out of stars, out of touch with the night. How many stars in the sky can you see?&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; srcset=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-2.5-limit_ST_edited-2.jpg 504w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-stars-magnitude-2.5-limit_ST_edited-2-300x179.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The same sky as above but seen from the downtown of a larger city. The reddish glow is simulated light pollution from high-pressure sodium vapor lights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Stellarium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder city dwellers are stunned by the night sky when they take their first trip to the country. Stars barely exist for those trapped beneath an ever-present dome of light pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stargazing.net/david/constel/howmanystars.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numbers increase exponentially&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if we go in the opposite direction as there are far more faint stars than bright. The standard limit for a pair of 50-mm binoculars is 9th magnitude, opening up a vista of some 217,000 stars across the heavens. Impressed? A 3-inch telescope pulls in a treasure-worthy 5.3 million, enough for several lifetimes of viewing pleasure. Dare I go further?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_255427986&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/47833278@N02/15081204590/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-255427986 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-Stars-magnitude-9.5-limit-binoculars_ST_edited-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owl-eyed sky a starry paradise&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; srcset=&quot;http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-Stars-magnitude-9.5-limit-binoculars_ST_edited-2.jpg 504w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky-Stars-magnitude-9.5-limit-binoculars_ST_edited-2-300x179.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;If we had eyes that could gather as much light as do a pair of 50-mm binoculars, we'd be dumbstruck with its richness. Many of the fainter stars can barely be seen in this much reduced simulation. Click to enlarge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Stellarium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the very best nights, I can reach 16th magnitude with my 15-inch telescope, or 380 million stars. Well, only half that really, but who's counting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
A French-born American has now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4446066-1-Complaint.html&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; his home country because, he claims, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has illegally seized a domain that he’s owned since 1994: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.france.com&quot;&gt;France.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, Jean-Noël Frydman bought France.com from Web.com and set up a website to serve as a &quot;digital kiosk&quot; for Francophiles and Francophones in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gauliath.wpengine.com/&quot;&gt;For over 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, Frydman built up a business (also known as France.com), often collaborating with numerous official French agencies, including the Consulate General in Los Angeles and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sometime around 2015, that very same ministry initiated a lawsuit in France in an attempt to wrest control of the France.com domain away from Frydman. Web.com locked the domain, and Frydman even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4446836-France-Com-202016-04-15-20-Letter-20to-20-Web-Com.html&quot;&gt;roped&lt;/a&gt; in the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard Law School to intervene on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By September 2017, the Paris Court of Appeals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4446106-Copy-20of-20the-20-Translation-20-Jugement-20of.html&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that France.com was violating French trademark law. Armed with this ruling, lawyers representing the French state wrote to Web.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4446110-Notification-20letter-20domain-20name-20-France.html&quot;&gt;demanding&lt;/a&gt; that the domain be handed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on March 12, 2018, Web.com abruptly transferred ownership of the domain to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The company did so without any formal notification to Frydman and no compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm probably [one of Web.com's] oldest customers,&quot; Frydman told Ars. &quot;I've been with them for 24 years... There's never been any cases against France.com, and they just did that without any notice. I've never been treated like that by any company anywhere in the world. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 19, Frydman filed a federal lawsuit in Virginia in an attempt to get his domain name back. The suit names the French Republic, Atout France (a government tourism agency), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the minister himself (Jean-Yves Le Drian), and VeriSign as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the defendants has yet made a formal appearance in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web.com, the original registrar, is not a party to the lawsuit. However, the company seems to have taken it upon itself to heed the French legal ruling and give up the France.com domain name without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Frydman's civil complaint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4446066-1-Complaint.html#document/p4/a420695&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the incidents complained of in this lawsuit, Defendants did not object to nor challenge Plaintiff's ownership or use of &amp;lt;France.com&amp;gt;. To the contrary, and as previously demonstrated in Exhibit A, Defendants publicly recognized Plaintiff as a leader in the tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Defendants began expressing an interest in owning the &amp;lt;France.com&amp;gt; domain name and exploiting it for Defendants' own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants did not approach Plaintiff to purchase or license the domain, the trademark, or Plaintiff's underlying business and goodwill. Instead, in 2015, Defendants misused the French judicial system to seize the domain from Plaintiff without compensation, under the erroneous theory that Defendants were inherently entitled to take the domain because it included the word &quot;France.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants knew that they did not, and do not, have a right to the word &quot;France,&quot; as evidenced by Defendant Atout France's US Trademark Registration No. 4027580, filed in 2009, in which Defendant expressly disclaimed the exclusive right to the word &quot;France.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accuses France of cybersquatting France.com and &quot;reverse domain-name hijacking,&quot; among other allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web.com's chief legal officer, Matt McClure, did not respond to Ars' request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They claim to be a company that's good for small businesses,&quot; Frydman said. &quot;What a joke. They've been absolutely horrible, not even answering our emails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
