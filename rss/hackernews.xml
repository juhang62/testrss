<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285?guestAccessKey=29ac3052-6203-4fb4-b1e2-d9dda5988445&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=110420&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of 24 adults with major depression finds that two doses of the psychedelic substance psilocybin, given with supportive psychotherapy, produced rapid and large reductions in depressive symptoms. Most of the participants showed improvement, and half achieved remission at the four-week follow-up.&lt;span id=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-adpicker-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ezoic-ad medrectangle-3 adtester-container adtester-container-111&quot; data-ez-name=&quot;psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3-0&quot; ezaw=&quot;250&quot; ezah=&quot;250&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; is a compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms.” It produces visual and auditory hallucinations, and profound changes in consciousness, over a period of several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared on November 4 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effect of psilocybin 4x stronger than traditional antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” said co-author &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/davis&quot;&gt;Alan Davis&lt;/a&gt; of Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the paper explains, “the effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy, and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacological depression treatment studies.”&lt;span id=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-adpicker-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ezoic-ad medrectangle-4 adtester-container adtester-container-107&quot; data-ez-name=&quot;psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4-0&quot; ezaw=&quot;336&quot; ezah=&quot;280&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-ad ezoic-adl&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up” in future clinical trials,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And compared to traditional antidepressants, the side effects of psilocybin are more limited. These include mild-to-moderate headaches, and “challenging emotions” during the sessions. Antidepressant medications, on the other hand, have more far-reaching side effects. These include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-finds-ethnic-variation-in-suicide-method-guns-vs-hanging/&quot;&gt;suicidal&lt;/a&gt; ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the effectiveness of psilocybin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/effects-of-therapy-for-hypochondriacs-last-10-years-or-more/&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; appears after only one or two administrations. This represents another&lt;br/&gt;advantage over commonly used antidepressants, which typically require daily administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two five-hour psilocybin sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the researchers recruited 24 people with a long-term history of depression. Most of the participants had experienced symptoms for about two years before enrolling in the study. &lt;span id=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-108&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-adpicker-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ezoic-ad box-4 adtester-container adtester-container-108&quot; data-ez-name=&quot;psychnewsdaily_com-box-4&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-psychnewsdaily_com-box-4-0&quot; ezaw=&quot;300&quot; ezah=&quot;250&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants underwent two five-hour psilocybin sessions, under the supervision of the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of participants was 39. Sixteen were women. Twenty-two identified as white, one identified as Asian, and one identified as African American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants had to taper off any antidepressants prior to the study. They did so with the help of their personal physician, to ensure safe exposure to this experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment consisted of two psilocybin doses given by two monitors who provided guidance and reassurance. The doses were given two weeks apart, between August 2017 and April 2019. Each treatment session lasted about five hours. The participants lay on a couch wearing eyeshades and headphones that played music, in the presence of the monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A very large reduction in depressive symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants completed the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408526/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&lt;/a&gt; upon enrollment. They also did this same assessment at one and four weeks following completion of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A score of 24 or more indicates severe depression. A score of 17-23 means moderate depression, 8-16 mild depression, and 7 or less no depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At enrollment, participants had an average depression scale rating of 23. But at one week and four weeks after treatment, they had an average depression scale score of 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After treatment, most participants showed a substantial decrease in their symptoms. Likewise, almost half were in remission from depression at the four-week follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up, and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission, meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to ketamine, another psychoactive substance that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25038867/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;recently been found&lt;/a&gt; to alleviate depression, psilocybin has several advantages. The antidepressant effects of psilocybin seem to last longer. Psilocybin also has a lower potential for addiction and adverse events than ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More results to follow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say they will follow the participants for a year after the study to see how long the antidepressant effects of the psilocybin treatment last. They will report these new findings in a later publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers first reported that treatment with psilocybin under psychologically supported conditions significantly relieved existential anxiety and depression in people with a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;life-threatening cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 17 million people in the U.S., and 300 million people worldwide, have experienced major &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/depression/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur and philanthropist &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt; supported the funding campaign for this study. “I believe this study to be a critically important proof of concept for the medical approval of psilocybin for treatment of depression, a condition I have personally struggled with for decades,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do we explain the incredible magnitude and durability of effects? Treatment research with moderate to high doses of psychedelics may uncover entirely new paradigms for understanding and improving mood and mind,” Ferriss said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Designing Raspberry Pi 400</title>
<link>https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/designing-raspberry-pi-400/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/designing-raspberry-pi-400/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a journey, but it’s finally here, and I can talk about the secret Raspberry Pi 400 project! I’ll also try to cover some of the questions you asked following Eben’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/&quot;&gt;announcement of Raspberry Pi 400&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;571&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-800x571.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64953&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-800x571.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-500x357.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-desktop-Sense-HAT.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four years in the making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been over four years since the original idea of a Raspberry Pi inside a keyboard was discussed, before I even started working at Raspberry Pi Towers. Initially, the plan was for a kit with all the parts needed for people simply to open the box and get started by connecting the accessories to a “classic” credit-card sized Raspberry Pi. The challenge was that we needed a mouse and a keyboard: if we could manufacture a mouse and a keyboard, we could make a complete kit. How hard could it be? Then, within a day of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/official-raspberry-pi-keyboard-mouse/&quot;&gt;announcing our new keyboard and mouse&lt;/a&gt;, we saw a blog from someone who had milled out the keyboard and integrated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+&lt;/a&gt; into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our jaws dropped – we were impressed but we couldn’t say a word. Then others did the same with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and by that point we kind of expected that. We knew it was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard and mouse were the big things we needed to sort out: once the quality control and supply chain were in place for those, we could move to fitting keyboard matrices to Raspberry Pi 400s, and achieve final assembly in Sony’s manufacturing facility in Wales. We had first planned to make a Raspberry Pi 3-based version, but it was clear that getting such a complex item into product wouldn’t happen until after we’d launched Raspberry Pi 4, and this would make the new product seem like a runner-up. So, instead, we started work on the Raspberry Pi 4-based version as soon as the design for that was finalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A fresh, new Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board inside the housing is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 unit, but with a fresh PCB design. It has the same USB and Ethernet system as the Raspberry Pi 4, but one of the USB2.0 ports is dedicated to the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-500x357.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-65096&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-500x357.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-768x549.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS-800x572.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/RPI400_INNARDS.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Left-handed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen a few comments about the USB ports being on the left side of the unit, and the fact that this makes the mouse cable cross over for most right-handed users. The PCB shape had to be defined early on so that the industrial designers could get on with the housing design, and I then stared endlessly at the PCB layout, trying to get one of the USB ports to route to the right side without wrecking the signal integrity of the memory or the HDMI; I could not find a way to do this. Left-handed folks and Bluetooth mouse-owners will be happy at least!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-800x572.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64959&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-800x572.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-500x357.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-768x549.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-ports.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Micro HDMI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi 400 has dual-band 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.0. Like Raspberry Pi 4, it has dual micro HDMI output which achieves up to 4K video. It would have been lovely to have had full-size HDMI connectors, but in order to achieve this we would have to remove other functions, or make a bulkier unit. However, the kit does come with a micro HDMI-to-HDMI cable to cheer you all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept the GPIO connector since it is loved so much by beginners and experts alike, and this is after all a Raspberry Pi – we want people to be able to use it for tinkering and prototyping. The HAT functionality works better with an extender cable, which you can buy from numerous websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-800x322.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64957&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-800x322.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-500x201.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270-1536x618.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/10/Raspberry-Pi-400-back-view-2-e1604083605270.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.8GHz!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi 400 has the same circuit layout of the power management, processor, and memory as Raspberry Pi 4, but with one major difference: we’ve adjusted the operating point to 1.8GHz! And did I mention cooling? We’ve solved the cooling challenge so users don’t have to give this any thought. Raspberry Pi 400 contains a heat spreader that dissipates the heat across the whole unit, front and back, so that no part of it will feel too hot to touch. In fact, there is enough thermal margin to overclock it, if you’re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not the Compute Module?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks have asked us why we did not fit the Raspberry Pi Compute Module inside. The reason is that above a certain scale, it generally makes more sense to go with a custom PCB rather than a module with a carrier board. With hundreds of thousands of Raspberry Pi 400 units in the first instance, we are above that scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turn it off and on again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a feature that is completely new to Raspberry Pi products: an on/off button! Power off is achieved by holding down Fn+F10 for two seconds. This is a soft control that negotiates with Linux to shut down, so you don’t corrupt your memory card or your USB drive. Power can be restored by pressing F10 (or Fn+F10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of love went into making this the best possible product we can manufacture, and it has been through extensive alpha testing and compliance testing. I thought I would show you the insides of a very early prototype. There are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/OqpylxLhw98&quot;&gt;some teardown videos online&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see how Raspberry Pi 400 is put together; it has not changed much from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-800x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-65099&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/First-Raspberry-400-2048x1536.jpg 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;Inside one of the first Raspberry Pi 400 units – 3D-printed and CNC-machined. ~£1500 each to build!
&lt;h2&gt;Raspberry Pi 400 kit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official Raspberry Pi mouse has been a lovely product to have available where Raspberry Pi 400 is concerned, because now we can provide a complete kit of official matching Raspberry Pi parts that looks fantastic on your desk. The kit comes with the SD card already programmed and inserted, so on Christmas day, you just need to plug it into the family TV and start coding. No frantic searches for somewhere that sells memory cards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;micro HDMI to HDMI cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewel box to store the SD card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth-edition &lt;em&gt;Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide&lt;/em&gt; book with instructions for getting started with Raspberry Pi 400, as well as loads of things you can do with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ode to Commodore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a bit of fun to finish with. On Christmas morning 1985, I opened the polystyrene box of a Commodore 64 computer and the world switched on for me. It had the best games and the best sound, and it was easy to program. We think the combination of gaming and programming still works today, but we’ve come a long way since 1985. Here’s a chart to show how a Commodore 64 and a Raspberry Pi 400 compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; src=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-800x373.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-65097&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-800x373.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-300x140.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-500x233.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-768x358.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-1536x716.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/11/C64_comparison-2048x954.png 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the benchmark increase for less than half the power. This makes Raspberry Pi 400 almost a million times more efficient at processing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do hope this bring smiles to the faces of those fortunate enough to get one by Christmas. The factory has been running flat-out for the last two months building up stock – order yours soon though, since they’ll sell quickly! &lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. Exits Paris Climate Accord</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-scientists-reacted-to-the-u-s-leaving-the-paris-climate-agreement/&quot;&gt;exit from the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt; takes effect today, capping four years of President Donald Trump aggressively rolling back the Obama administration’s climate-change-mitigation policies. The acceleration of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions on Trump’s watch has been blunted by state- and city-level efforts, a burgeoning renewable energy market and the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic downturn. But the Trump-era rollbacks could still ultimately lead to more heat-trapping carbon entering the atmosphere over the next decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.’s position contrasts starkly with that of much of the rest of the world. Other industrialized nations “are crafting detailed policies that are suited to their individual national context and making commitments that are high-ambition and delivered in many different ways with the policies that they will enact,” says Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Just last week, for example, Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to reduce his country’s carbon emissions to zero by 2050. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-says-it-will-stop-releasing-co2-within-40-years/&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en#:~:text=The%20EU%20aims%20to%20be,action%20under%20the%20Paris%20Agreement.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have made similar commitments. “At this moment, the U.S. is globally isolated,” Cleetus adds. “No other country has left the agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Paris Agreement was concluded in 2015, it was hailed as a historic commitment, among nearly 200 nations, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stave off the worst effects of climate change. The pact’s stated aim was to keep global average temperatures from increasing by more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of this century and to pursue efforts to keep that temperature rise below 1.5 degrees C. Contrary to Trump’s assertions, the agreement (which took effect in November 2016), is not prescriptive; signatory countries are asked to implement their own emissions-reduction strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing the agreement was something of a capstone to the ambitious climate policies championed by President Barack Obama. U.S. emissions had steadily increased for decades before he was elected, and his administration reversed this trend. It took actions such as setting stricter fuel economy standards for vehicles and setting out a Climate Action Plan that “outlined systematic emission reductions for almost every sector of the economy,” says Kate Larsen, a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization. Larsen recently co-authored an analysis that found &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhg.com/research/the-rollback-of-us-climate-policy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trump’s climate policy rollbacks&lt;/a&gt; could add the equivalent of one third of the country’s 2019 greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2035. “We estimate that had all of the Obama policies been put in place, the U.S. would have come close to meeting the [2009] &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/12/21/21climatewire-obama-negotiates-copenhagen-accord-with-senat-6121.html?pagewanted=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Copenhagen [Accord] commitment&lt;/a&gt; of a 17 percent reduction [in carbon emissions below 2005 levels] in 2020,” she says. Obama’s policies would not have brought about the Paris Agreement’s more rigorous goal of 26 to 28 percent reductions below 2005 levels by 2025, but they “would have been an important first start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump began attempting to unravel his predecessor’s legacy almost immediately after taking office. In March 2017 he ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to scrap the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-far-does-obama-s-clean-power-plan-go-in-slowing-climate-change/&quot;&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt;—an Obama-era policy that aimed to reduce U.S. emissions from power generation by 32 percent of 2005 levels by 2030—and under this directive, the agency replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule. According to the Rhodium Group analysis, that policy change alone could result in as much as an extra 624 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. The Trump administration has also weakened fuel efficiency requirements and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-completes-climate-dismantling-with-methane-rollback/&quot;&gt;rolled back numerous regulations related to methane&lt;/a&gt;, a potent greenhouse gas, among other actions. Collectively, those rule changes will result in an excess 1.8 billion metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent by 2035, according to the Rhodium report. “The last four years of the Trump administration has not only been a reversal of many of the Obama policies that would have put us on track with meeting our initial obligations,” Larsen says, “[it has also been] four years of lost opportunities to continue the progress of the Obama administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that lost time, a confluence of factors has prevented Trump’s rollbacks of emissions standards from manifesting their worst possible outcomes. Efforts by states and municipalities to fill the gap—along with the growing economic competitiveness of renewable energy sources—have helped curb emissions in the absence of federal regulations. Joseph Aldy, an economist at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, who served as Obama’s special assistant for energy and the environment from 2009 to 2010, says the result is that emissions output has plateaued, rather than spiked, during Trump’s tenure. “The Trump administration has slowed progress considerably, but they haven’t reversed progress,” Aldy says. “They’re certainly not consistent with their [campaign] rhetoric to bring back coal” as an energy source. (Coal-fired power plants produce more than twice as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as natural gas plants.) The combined market forces of cheap natural gas, wind and solar power mean “there’s just no economic reason” to be investing in coal, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 shutdowns have also dampened the U.S.’s 2020 emissions output. According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; in May, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x?fbclid=IwAR0xRkUKsPWMpJW_3gyHXqJHmj5u6npfEsnVcPfE2GZjDwbFnetFXoEEKDo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions decreased&lt;/a&gt; by about 17 percent in the first four months of 2020, compared with the previous year. The largest reductions were caused by sharp decreases in aviation and surface transport. Another paper, published in October in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; found CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions began to rise again in May and June 2020, resulting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18922-7&quot;&gt;global emissions decline of about 9 percent&lt;/a&gt;, compared with 2019. Eri Saikawa, an environmental scientist at Emory University, who was not involved in either study, says the fact that the COVID-19 shutdowns were the single largest factor in reducing emissions is rather bleak news. “We really need to do everything we can to reduce [emissions],” she says. “COVID cannot do that.” If the federal government continues to ignore climate change after the pandemic subsides, grassroots movements could pressure local governments to move forward on their own, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal climate change action now depends largely on who takes office in January 2021. The Trump administration is continuing to enact rollbacks to emissions regulations and appointing officials who have made statements casting doubt on widely accepted climate science to key government positions. But former vice president Joe Biden has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-biden-administration-could-reverse-trumps-climate-legacy/&quot;&gt;pledged to enact climate-change polices&lt;/a&gt; that are even more ambitious than Obama’s. He has also said he will bring the U.S. back into the Paris pact. Doing so would be a relatively simple process and would take place 30 days after Biden sends notification of his intent to rejoin. But even if a Biden administration aggressively tackles carbon emissions, Trump’s impact on climate policy could be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a longer-term effect of failing to act over the past four years,” Aldy says. “We need a serious, whole-of-the-economy, whole-of-the-government approach to public policy [on climate change]. It’s the delay in getting that going which makes it all the more challenging. But as [Trump has] demonstrated with COVID, it’s hard for him to actually do hard work to deal with challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>RIAA Takedowns Backfire as Pirated MP3s Now Surface on GitHub</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;article__excerpt&quot;&gt;Two weeks ago the RIAA asked GitHub to remove the open-source stream-ripper software youtube-dl. This request wasn't well-received by developers, many of whom retaliated by posting copies of the code. Yesterday, things went from bad to worse when a user with the name 'F*** T** RIAA' uploaded three MP3s of the songs the RIAA mentioned in its takedown notice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;126.42449789239&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/fuckriaa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;f riaa&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-196182&quot;/&gt;The RIAA and other music groups see people who download music from YouTube as a major piracy threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with this problem, they have increased their enforcement actions against stream-ripping tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RIAA Takes Youtube-dl Off GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to lawsuits and takedown notices, where it’s argued that stream-ripping sites and software violate the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions. That was also the case with the open-source software youtube-dl, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-takes-down-popular-open-source-youtube-dl-software-201024/&quot;&gt;pulled from Github last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RIAA informed GitHub of the alleged copyright violations and the developer platform swiftly complied, taking the software offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen similar requests in the past but this one struck a nerve, especially among developers. They believe that the RIAA went too far. As we highlighted earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/&quot;&gt;hundreds of new copies&lt;/a&gt; of the youtube-dl code appeared online in response, also on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GitHub’s CEO Nat Friedman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/&quot;&gt;annoyed&lt;/a&gt; by RIAA takedown efforts, he stressed that the platform legally had to comply, which it did. More recently, the company even said that users who continue to republish the code &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/deciphering-youtubes-rolling-cypher-in-your-browser-is-a-piece-of-cake-201030/&quot;&gt;risk being banned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full MP3s Now Appear on GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far this hasn’t stopped the problem. The youtube-dl code continues to be uploaded to GitHub multiple times a day. This obviously frustrated the RIAA, but the music group has a bigger problem too. Full MP3s are being shared on the site as well now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago we spotted a new GitHub user named ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FuckTheRIAA/&quot;&gt;FuckTheRIAA&lt;/a&gt;‘ who uploaded a copy of youtube-dl as well as a ‘FuckTheRIAA’ repository that includes three songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/profileftheriaa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;f riaa&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-196186&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These songs from Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, and Icona Pop, were not chosen randomly. The same tracks were mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md&quot;&gt;RIAA’s original takedown request&lt;/a&gt;, as the YouTube videos were highlighted in the youtube-dl code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also note that the source code prominently includes as sample uses of the source code the downloading of copies of our members’ copyrighted sound recordings and music videos,” the RIAA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Will the RIAA Respond?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another example that shows how the RIAA’s takedown request has actually made things worse for the music group, at least for now. After nearly a day the three MP3 files are still available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak requested a comment from the RIAA on these unusual uploads but the group didn’t immediately reply. However, it seems likely that it will send another DMCA takedown request to remove the tracks from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the RIAA will also file takedown notices to remove all of the new youtube-dl forks has yet to be seen. For now, its takedown efforts have only made things worse, so they may let things cool down for a while first while exploring other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawful Uses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, a lot of people and organizations have criticized the RIAA’s enforcement efforts, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;, which stressed that “youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of lawful uses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF believes that the circumvention restrictions in DMCA section 1201, which prevent people from bypassing technological restrictions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-youtube-dl-takedown-isnt-just-problem-american-law&quot;&gt;are too broad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DMCA 1201 is incredibly broad, apparently allowing rightsholders to legally harass any ‘trafficker’ in code that lets users re-take control of their devices from DRM locks,” EFF wrote recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to another issue we highlighted recently. How much circumvention is involved when &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/deciphering-youtubes-rolling-cypher-in-your-browser-is-a-piece-of-cake-201030/&quot;&gt;anyone can bypass YouTube’s ‘restrictions’&lt;/a&gt; in a regular web browser without extra tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RIAA, however, is convinced that it has the law on its side and thus far its takedown efforts have been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the controversy, it will be interesting to see how US courts interpret this issue. The legality of YouTube download services has never been properly litigated and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-rippers-flvto-and-2conv-will-take-legal-battle-to-us-supreme-court-200919/&quot;&gt;Flvto/2conv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-sued-by-youtube-ripping-site-over-dmca-anti-circumvention-notices-201027/&quot;&gt;Yout.com lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; could bring more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the GitHub user named FuckTheRIAA appears to have made up their mind already. Meanwhile, youtube-dl remains available via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yt-dl.org/&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
