<description>&lt;li readability=&quot;11.954887218045&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Case About?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case relates to a hack on defendant Zappos.com LLC’s (formerly known as Zappos.com, Inc.) (“Defendant” or “Zappos”) data security systems in January 2012. The case alleges that Zappos’s data security practices on and prior to January 15, 2012, exposed consumers to a heightened risk of identity theft, fraud or other harm, and further alleges that these risks were not properly disclosed to consumers. The case also alleges that Zappos customers suffered inconvenience, harm and increased risk as a result. Zappos denies all wrongdoing in the matter, denies that any valuable data was stolen, and denies that any consumer was harmed by the hack. Nonetheless, Zappos has agreed to the settlement described here, without admitting any fault in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;10.921241050119&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Class Action?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a class action, one or more people called class representatives (in this case Theresa D. Stevens, Denise Relethford, Emily E. Braxton, Stephanie Preira (also known as Stephanie Huppert), Robert Ree, Patti Hasner, Dahlia Habashy (also known as Dahlia Bonzagni), Katharine Vorhoff and Shari Simon (collectively, “Class Representatives”)) sue on behalf of people who have similar claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;4.9462365591398&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I a Settlement Class Member?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a Settlement Class Member if, on or before January 15, 2012, you had an online account with Zappos, and Zappos had an email address for your account in its records at that time. Both individuals and legal entities can be Class Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.9739884393064&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is There a Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to a settlement to avoid the uncertainty and cost of litigation, and to provide benefits to Class Members more promptly. The Court did not decide in favor of the Class Representatives or Zappos. Zappos denies any liability or wrongdoing of any kind associated with the claims in this class action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7.7865429234339&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can I Get From the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may use the discount code emailed to you to receive 10% off a single future online purchase on Zappos.com or via the Zappos.com mobile app of goods (exclusive of shipping costs and taxes). Your discount code cannot be used to purchase gift cards or on previous purchases. &lt;span&gt;Your discount code is valid immediately.&lt;/span&gt; You also may transfer this discount code to someone else for individual, non-commercial use. Discount codes expire December 31, 2019, but if the settlement is not approved by the Court, they may expire sooner. If you are unable to use your discount code immediately due to hospitalization or military service, you may request a substitute code by sending an email to &lt;span&gt;2012action@zappos.com&lt;/span&gt;. Discount codes have no cash value, and other terms and conditions of use are explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/media/2391587/settlement_agreement_and_release.pdf&quot;&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;116.21499416569&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Am I Giving Up to Get Settlement Benefits or Stay In the Settlement Class?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you exclude yourself, as described below, you will remain in the Settlement Class and be bound by the terms of the settlement and all of the Court’s orders. This means that you can’t sue or be part of any other lawsuit against Defendant or related parties (including Amazon.com) about the January 2012 data security hack or any other issues in this case. Staying in the Settlement Class also means that you agree to the release of the following claims, including any unknown claims, as set forth in greater detail in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/media/2391587/settlement_agreement_and_release.pdf&quot;&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release of the Settlement Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any and all rights, duties, obligations, claims, actions, causes of action or liabilities, whether known or unknown, including, without limitation, claims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, public disclosure of private facts, violations of Cal. Bus. &amp;amp; Prof. Code § 17200 et seq., Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.29 &amp;amp; 1798.80, Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq., Fla. Stat. Ann. § 501.204(1) et seq., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, M.C.P.L.A. §§ 445.903(1)(c), 445.903(1)(e), 445.903(1)(s) &amp;amp; 445.903(1)(cc), Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 598.0903, 598,0915(5), 598.0915(15) &amp;amp; 598.0923(2), N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 349, 598.0915(5) &amp;amp; 598.0915(7), Tex. Bus. &amp;amp; Com. Code §§ 17.46(a), 17.46(b)(5), 17.46(b)(7) &amp;amp; 17.50(a)(3) and unjust enrichment, whether arising under local, state or federal law, whether by Constitution, statute, contract, rule, regulation, any regulatory promulgation (including, without limitation, any opinion or declaratory ruling), common law or equity, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, foreseen or unforeseen, actual or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, punitive or compensatory concerning the Released Parties’ conduct, policies, or practices, arising from, related to, connected with, or described in the litigation (and all related cases) that were alleged or could have been alleged in the litigation, the Third Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint or any other pleading or other document filed in the litigation, whether the claims are brought directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any Settlement Class Member in an individual or class action, representative action or in any other capacity, with respect to any form of relief, including without limitation damages, restitution, disgorgement, penalties, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “&lt;strong&gt;Released Parties&lt;/strong&gt;” are Zappos, and all of its present, former and future officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys, servants, heirs, administrators, executors, members, member entities, predecessors, successors, subsidiaries (direct and indirect), parents (direct and indirect) (including, but not limited to, Amazon.com, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries), affiliates (controlling, controlled by or under common control with Zappos), representatives, trustees, principals, insurers, vendors and assigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the settlement is &lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; approved by the Court, and if you use or transfer your discount code, Zappos may argue at a later date that you have already been fully compensated by your use or transfer of the discount code, and accordingly that you are not entitled to any other relief; however, you may present any arguments in opposition to Zappos’s arguments if this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;24.943310657596&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I Exclude Myself From the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to receive benefits from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue Defendant on your own and at your own expense about the issues in this case, then you must take steps to exclude yourself from the settlement. This is also called “opting out” of the settlement. To exclude yourself from the settlement (opt out), you must send a letter to the Settlement Administrator at the following address containing: (1) your signature; (2) your full name, address, email address and Zappos.com account number, if any; and (3) a statement that you request to be excluded from the Settlement Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zappos Settlement Administrator - Exclusions&lt;br/&gt;P.O. Box 43434&lt;br/&gt;Providence, RI 02940-3434&lt;br/&gt;info@zapposdatasettlement.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opt out deadline is November 29, 2019 and, to be valid, an opt out request must be postmarked no later than that date. If you request exclusion from the settlement, you will not get any settlement benefits, and you cannot object to the terms of the settlement. You will not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit. &lt;span&gt;If you use or transfer your discount code, you are not permitted to exclude yourself and you will be bound by the terms of the settlement, including the release of claims, if the settlement is approved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12.952955367913&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I Don’t Exclude Myself, Can I Sue Defendant for the Same Thing Later?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Unless you exclude yourself, you &lt;span&gt;give up any right&lt;/span&gt; to sue Defendant and/or any of the Released Parties for the claims that this settlement resolves, if the settlement is approved by the Court. If you have a pending lawsuit covering these same claims, speak to your lawyer in that case immediately. You must exclude yourself from this Settlement Class to continue your own lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if the settlement is not approved by the Court but you have used or transferred your discount code, Zappos may argue that such use or transfer has fully compensated you and Zappos may argue for that reason that you may no longer pursue a claim against Zappos; however, you would be permitted to present arguments in opposition to Zappos’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9.9383983572895&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Have a Lawyer in the Case?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has appointed Ben Barnow (Barnow and Associates, P.C.), Jeremiah Frei-Pearson (Finkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson &amp;amp; Garber, LLP), Mark Godino (Glancy Prongay &amp;amp; Murray, LLP) and Richard Coffman (The Coffman Law Firm) to represent you and other Class Members as Class Counsel. Class Counsel will be paid by Zappos and you will not be charged for this. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;17.747316267547&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Will the Lawyers, the Class Representatives and the Settlement Administrator Be Paid?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zappos will pay the Settlement Administrator for the costs associated with administering the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of up to $1,620,000 in total to Class Counsel (and to additional plaintiff’s counsel who worked on the case) for attorneys’ fees, out-of-pocket costs, and service awards to the Class Representatives. The service award requests will amount to $22,500 of the $1,620,000 total, or $2,500 for each of the nine Class Representatives. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, negotiating the settlement and following through to make sure that its terms are carried out. The service awards reflect Class Representatives’ efforts to pursue the case and to provide information and documents in support of the claims. The Court may award less than the requested amounts. Class Counsel will file with the Court their motion for award of attorneys’ fees and litigation costs and Class Representatives’ service awards no later than November 20, 2019. After that date, you may view the motion under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/case-documents.aspx&quot; title=&quot;Case Documents&quot;&gt;Case Documents&lt;/a&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;21.963993453355&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do I Tell the Court That I Don’t Like the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask the Court to deny approval of the Settlement by making an objection. You can’t ask the Court to order a larger settlement; the Court can only approve or deny the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must object to the proposed settlement in writing. All written objections and supporting papers must include: (1) your full name and postal address, and, if represented by counsel, the name, bar number, address and telephone number of your attorney; (2) a statement that you are a Settlement Class Member; (3) documents establishing, or information sufficient to allow the Parties to confirm, that you are a Settlement Class Member; (4) a statement whether you intend to appear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through counsel; (5) a statement of your specific objections and the grounds supporting the objections; (6) identification and production of copies of any documents that you desire the Court to consider; and (7) your original signature (for individuals) or the original signature of a legally-authorized representative (for entities). Your objection must be filed with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada by November 29, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objections made through counsel must be filed and served electronically through the Court’s CM/ECF system. If you are not represented by counsel and file your objection with the Court in paper format, you must also mail copies of your objection to Class Counsel and Counsel for Zappos postmarked no later than November 29, 2019, at the address below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11.964035964036&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the Difference Between Objecting to the Settlement and Requesting Exclusion from the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objecting is telling the Court that you do not like something about the settlement. You can object &lt;span&gt;only if&lt;/span&gt; you stay in the Settlement Class. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not want to be part of the Settlement Class or participate in the settlement. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. You cannot both object to and exclude yourself from the settlement. Those who attempt to both object and exclude themselves from the settlement will be deemed to have excluded themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use or transfer your discount code, you may still object to the settlement. However, if you use or transfer your discount code, you are not permitted to exclude yourself and you will be bound by the settlement and release (give up) all claims as described above and in the settlement agreement, if the Court approves the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;15.953307392996&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and Where Will the Court Decide Whether to Approve the Settlement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing regarding the settlement on December 20, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 3 of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, located at 400 S. Virginia Street, Reno, Nevada 89501. At that hearing, the Court will consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider them. The Court will listen to people who ask to speak at the hearing that have timely filed an objection and given notice of their intent to appear. The Court also will decide how much to pay to Class Counsel and the Class Representatives. At or after the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the settlement. Class Counsel does not know how long those decisions will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Final Approval Hearing date, time or location may be changed and notice of any change will be provided on this website, so please check back regularly if you plan to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7.9533073929961&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Have to Come to the Hearing?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Class Counsel will answer questions the Court may have. You are welcome to come at your own expense. If you send an objection, you don’t have to come to Court to talk about it. As long as you submit your written objection on time, the Court will consider it. You may also have your own lawyer attend the hearing at your own expense, but doing so is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot submit an objection or speak at the hearing if you excluded yourself from the Settlement Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposdatasettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#bodytop&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.9697732997481&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens if I Do Nothing at All?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do nothing, you will remain in the Settlement Class and will be bound by the terms of the settlement and all of the Court’s orders, including the Release. This also means that you will not receive any settlement benefits and can’t sue or be part of any other lawsuit against Defendant or the other Released Parties about the issues in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;header class=&quot;article__header article__header--inline&quot; readability=&quot;25.685714285714&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/author/mitch-leslie&quot;&gt;Mitch Leslie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Oct. 17, 2019 , 2:00 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice put human runners to shame. Despite taking puny strides, the rodents can log 10 kilometers or more per night on an exercise wheel. But the mice that muscle biologist Eric Olson of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and colleagues unveiled in 2015 stood out. On a treadmill, the mice could scurry up a steep 10% grade for about 90 minutes before faltering, 31% longer than other rodents. Those iron mice differed from counterparts in just one small way—the researchers had genetically altered the animals to lack one muscle protein. That was enough to unleash superior muscle performance. &quot;It's like you've taken the brakes off,&quot; Olson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as startling was the nature of the crucial protein. Muscles house some gargantuan proteins. Dystrophin, a structural protein whose gene can carry mutations that cause muscular dystrophy, has more than 3600 amino acids. Titin, which acts like a spring to give muscles elasticity, is the biggest known protein, with more than 34,000 amino acids. The protein disabled in the mice has a paltry 46. Although researchers have probed how muscles work for more than 150 years, they had completely missed the huge impact this tiny protein, called myoregulin, has on muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olson and his colleagues weren't the only ones to be blindsided by Lilliputian proteins. As scientists now realize, their initial rules for analyzing genomes discriminated against identifying those pint-size molecules. Now, broader criteria and better detection methods are uncovering minuscule proteins by the thousands, not just in mice, but in many other species, including humans. &quot;For the first time, we are about to explore this universe of new proteins,&quot; says biochemist Jonathan Weissman of the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists are just beginning to delve into the functions of those molecules, called microproteins, micropeptides, or miniproteins. But their small size seems to allow them to jam the intricate workings of larger proteins, inhibiting some cellular processes while unleashing others. Early findings suggest microproteins bolster the immune system, control destruction of faulty RNA molecules, protect bacteria from heat and cold, dictate when plants flower, and provide the toxic punch for many types of venom. &quot;There's probably going to be small [proteins] involved in all biological processes. We just haven't looked for them before,&quot; says biochemist Alan Saghatelian of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small proteins also promise to revise the current understanding of the genome. Many appear to be encoded in stretches of DNA—and RNA—that were not thought to help build proteins of any sort. Some researchers speculate that the short stretches of DNA could be newborn genes, on their way to evolving into larger genes that make full-size proteins. Thanks in part to small proteins, &quot;We need to rethink what genes are,&quot; says microbiologist and molecular biologist Gisela Storz of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the remaining mysteries, scientists are already testing potential uses for the molecules. One company sells insecticides derived from small proteins in the poison of an Australian funnel-web spider. And a clinical trial is evaluating an imaging agent based on another minute protein in scorpion venom, designed to highlight the borders of tumors so that surgeons can remove them more precisely. Many drug companies are now searching for small proteins with medical potential, says biochemist Glenn King of the University of Queensland in St. Lucia, Australia. &quot;It's one of the most rapidly growing areas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-break-style&quot;&gt;Other short amino acid&lt;/span&gt; chains, often called peptides or polypeptides, abound in cells, but they are pared-down remnants of bigger predecessors. Myoregulin and its diminutive brethren, in contrast, are born small. How tiny they can be remains unclear. Fruit flies rely on a microprotein with 11 amino acids to grow normal legs, and some microbes may crank out proteins less than 10 amino acids long, notes microbial genomicist Ami Bhatt of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. But even the largest small proteins don't measure up to average-size proteins such as alpha amylase, a 496–amino-acid enzyme in our saliva that breaks down starch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few small proteins came to light until recently because of a criterion for identifying genes set about 20 years ago. When scientists analyze an organism's genome, they often scan for open reading frames (ORFs), which are DNA sequences demarcated by signals that tell the cell's ribosomes, its proteinmaking assembly lines, where to start and stop. In part to avoid a data deluge, past researchers typically excluded any ORF that would yield a protein smaller than 100 amino acids in eukaryotes or 50 amino acids in bacteria. In yeast, for example, that cutoff limited the list of ORFs to about 6000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxing that criterion reveals that cells carry vastly more ORFs. Earlier this year, Stanford postdoc Hila Sberro Livnat, Bhatt, and colleagues trawled genome fragments from the microbes that inhabit four parts of the human body, including the gut and skin. By searching for small ORFs that could encode proteins between five and 50 amino acids long, the researchers identified about 4000 families of potential microproteins. Almost half resemble no known proteins, but the sequence for one small ORF suggested that a corresponding protein resides in ribosomes—a hint that it could play some fundamental role. &quot;It's not just genes with esoteric functions that have been missed&quot; when scientists overlooked small ORFs, Bhatt says. &quot;It's genes with core functions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we are about to explore this universe of new proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Jonathan Weissman, University of California, San Francisco&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cells also house huge numbers of short ORFs—yeast could make more than 260,000 molecules with between two and 99 amino acids, for example. But cells almost certainly don't use all those ORFs, and some of the amino acid strings they produce may not be functional. In 2011, after finding more than 600,000 short ORFs in the fruit fly genome, developmental geneticist Juan Pablo Couso of the University of Sussex in Brighton, U.K., and colleagues tried to whittle down the number. They reasoned that if a particular ORF had an identical or near-identical copy in a related species, it was less likely to be genomic trash. After searching another fruit fly's genome and analyzing other evidence that the sequences were being translated, the group ended up with a more manageable figure of 401 short ORFs likely to yield microproteins. That would still represent a significant fraction of the insects' protein repertoire—they harbor about 22,000 full-size proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weissman and colleagues found microproteins a second way, through a method they invented to broadly determine which proteins cells are making. To fashion any protein, a cell first copies a gene into messenger RNA. Then ribosomes read the mRNA and string together amino acids in the order it specifies. By sequencing mRNAs attached to ribosomes, Weissman and his team pinpoint which ones cells are actually turning into proteins and where on the RNAs a ribosome starts to read. In a 2011 &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; study, he and his team applied that ribosome profiling method, also called Ribo-seq, to mouse embryonic stem cells and discovered the cells were making thousands of unexpected proteins, including many that would fall below the 100–amino-acid cutoff. &quot;It was quite clear that the standard understanding had ignored a large universe of proteins, many of which were short,&quot; Weissman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saghatelian and his colleagues adopted a third approach to discover a trove of microproteins in our own cells. The researchers used mass spectrometry, which involves breaking up proteins into pieces that are sorted by mass to produce a distinctive spectrum for each protein. Saghatelian, his then-postdoc Sarah Slavoff, and colleagues applied the method to protein mixtures from human cells and then subtracted the signatures of known proteins. That approach revealed spectra for 86 previously undiscovered tiny proteins, the smallest just 18 amino acids long, the researchers reported in 2013 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Chemical Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-break-style&quot;&gt;Being small limits&lt;/span&gt; a protein's capabilities. Larger proteins fold into complex shapes suited for a particular function, such as catalyzing chemical reactions. Proteins smaller than about 50 to 60 amino acids probably don't fold, says chemist Julio Camarero of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. So they probably aren't suited to be enzymes or structural proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their diminutive size also opens up opportunities. &quot;They are tiny enough to fit into nooks and crannies of larger proteins that function as channels and receptors,&quot; Olson says. Small proteins often share short stretches of amino acids with their larger partners and can therefore bind to and alter the activity of those proteins. Bound microproteins can also shepherd bigger molecules to new locations—helping them slip into cell membranes, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of their attraction to larger proteins, small proteins may give cells a reversible way to switch larger proteins on or off. In a 2016 study in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, plant developmental biologist Stephan Wenkel of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues genetically altered &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; plants to produce extra amounts of two small proteins. The plants normally burst into flower when the days are long enough, but when they overproduced the two microproteins, their flowering was postponed. The small proteins caused that delay by blocking a hefty protein called CONSTANS that triggers flowering. They tether CONSTANS to other inhibitory proteins that shut it down. &quot;A cell uses things that help it survive. If a short protein does the job, that's fine,&quot; Saghatelian says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those jobs include other key tasks. In 2016, Slavoff, Saghatelian, and colleagues revealed that human cells manufacture a 68–amino-acid protein they named NoBody that may help manage destruction of faulty or unneeded mRNA molecules. NoBody's name reflects its role in preventing formation of processing bodies (P-bodies), mysterious clusters in the cytoplasm where RNA breakdown may occur. When the protein is missing, more P-bodies form, thus boosting RNA destruction and altering the cell's internal structure. &quot;It shows that small proteins can have massive effects in the cell,&quot; Slavoff says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscles appear to depend on a variety of microproteins. During embryonic development, individual muscle cells merge into fibers that power contraction. The 84–amino-acid protein myomixer teams up with a larger protein to bring the cells together, Olson's team reported in 2017 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Without it, embryonic mice can't form muscles and are almost transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in life, myoregulin steps in to help regulate muscle activity. When a muscle receives a stimulus, cellular storage depots spill calcium, triggering the fibers to contract and generate force. An ion pump called SERCA then starts to return the calcium to storage, allowing the muscle fibers to relax. Myoregulin binds to and inhibits SERCA, Olson's team found. The effect limits how often a mouse's muscles can contract—perhaps ensuring that the animal has muscle power in reserve for an emergency, such as escaping a predator. Another small protein, DWORF, has the opposite effect, unleashing SERCA and enabling the muscle to contract repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even extensively studied organisms such as the intestinal bacterium &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; harbor unexpected small proteins that have important functions. Storz and her team reported in 2012 that a previously undiscovered 49–amino-acid protein called AcrZ helps the microbe survive some antibiotics by stimulating a pump that expels the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the venom produced by a variety of organisms—including spiders, centipedes, scorpions, and poisonous mollusks—teems with tiny proteins. Many venom components disable or kill by blocking the channels for sodium or other ions that are necessary for transmission of nerve impulses. Small proteins &quot;hit these ion channels with amazing specificity and potency,&quot; King says. &quot;They are the major components of venoms and are responsible for most of the pharmacological and biological effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia's giant fish-killing water bug, for instance, doesn't just rely on sharp claws and lancelike mouthparts to subdue prey. It injects its victims with a brew of more than 130 proteins, 15 of which have fewer than 100 amino acids, King and colleagues reported last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-break-style&quot;&gt;Unlike hulking proteins&lt;/span&gt; such as antibodies, microproteins delivered by pill or injection may be able to slip into cells and alter their functions. Captopril, the first of a class of drugs for high blood pressure known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was developed from a small protein in the venom of a Brazilian pit viper. But the drug, which the Food and Drug Administration approved for sale in the United States in 1981, was discovered by chance, before scientists recognized small proteins as a distinct group. So far, only a few microproteins have reached the market or clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer researchers are trying to capitalize on a microprotein in the poison of the deathstalker scorpion (&lt;em&gt;Leiurus quinquestriatus&lt;/em&gt;) of Africa and the Middle East. The molecule has a mysterious attraction to tumors. By fusing it to a fluorescent dye, scientists hope to illuminate the borders of brain tumors so that surgeons can safely cut out the cancerous tissue. &quot;It lights up the tumor. You can see the margins and if there are any metastases,&quot; King says. A clinical trial is now evaluating whether the dual molecule can help surgeons remove brain tumors in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How important small proteins will be for medicine is still unknown, but they have already upended several biological assumptions. Geneticist Norbert Hübner of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin and colleagues found dozens of new microproteins in human heart cells. The group traced them to an unexpected source: short sequences within long noncoding RNAs, a variety that was thought not to produce proteins. After identifying 169 long noncoding RNAs that were probably being read by ribosomes, Hübner and his team used a type of mass spectrometry to confirm that more than half of them yielded microproteins in heart cells, a result reported earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption__text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; also churn out many microproteins, although their functions remain unclear in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;KWANGSHIN KIM/SCIENCE SOURCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA sequences for other tiny proteins also occur in unconventional locations. For example, some lie near the ORFs for bigger proteins. Researchers previously thought those sequences helped manage the production of the larger proteins, but rarely gave rise to proteins themselves. Some coding sequences for recently discovered microproteins are even nested within sequences that encode other, longer proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those genomic surprises could illuminate how new genes arise, says evolutionary systems biologist Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis of the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Researchers had thought most new genes emerge when existing genes duplicate or fuse, or when species swap DNA. But to Carvunis, microproteins suggest protogenes can form when mutations create new start and stop signals in a noncoding portion of the genome. If the resulting ORF produces a beneficial protein, the novel sequences would remain in the genome and undergo natural selection, eventually evolving into larger genes that code for more complex proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2012 study, Carvunis, who was then a postdoc in the lab of Marc Vidal at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, and colleagues found that yeast translate more than 1000 short ORFs into proteins, implying that these sequences are protogenes. In a new study, Carvunis and her team tested whether young ORFs can be advantageous for cells. They genetically altered yeast to boost output of 285 recently evolved ORFs, most of which code for molecules that are smaller than the standard protein cutoff or just over it. For almost 10% of the proteins, increasing their levels enhanced cell growth in at least one environment. The results, posted on the preprint server bioRxiv, suggest these sequences could be on their way to becoming full-fledged genes, Carvunis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slavoff still recalls being astonished when, during her interview for a postdoc position with Saghatelian, he asked whether she would be willing to go hunting for small proteins. &quot;I had never thought that there could be this whole size of proteins that was dark to us until then.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bet paid off—she now runs her own lab that is searching for microproteins. Recently, she unleashed some of her postdocs and graduate students on one of the most studied organisms, the K12 strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli.&lt;/em&gt; The team soon uncovered five new microproteins. &quot;We are probably only scratching the surface,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;Last fall, Intuit’s longtime CEO Brad Smith embarked on a farewell tour of the company’s offices around the world. Smith had presided over 11 years of explosive growth, a period when Intuit had secured its place in the Silicon Valley pantheon, and the tour was like a long party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;2.2&quot;&gt;In Ontario, employees wore T-shirts with Smith’s quasi-spiritual sayings: “Do whatever makes your heart beat fastest” and “Repetition doesn’t ruin the prayer.” In Bangalore, India, workers put on Smith face masks as they posed for selfies with the man himself. Fittingly, the tour culminated in San Diego, the home of TurboTax, the software that transformed the company’s fortunes. There, Smith arrived at his party in a DeLorean, and as he walked a red carpet, cheering employees waved “Brad is Rad” signs. To Smith’s delight, his favorite rock star, Gene Simmons of Kiss, emerged. The two posed for pictures, Simmons clad in black and the beaming CEO flashing the “rock on” hand sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;2.3&quot;&gt;Intuit began in the 1980s as an accounting software company focused on helping people with their bookkeeping. Over time, the company, like the other giants of Big Tech, cultivated an image of being not just good at what it did, but good, period. In a recent Super Bowl ad, Intuit portrayed itself as a gentle robot that liberates small-business owners from paperwork. The company stresses values above all, urging employees to “deliver awesome” and pursue “integrity without compromise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;Intuit’s QuickBooks accounting product remains a steady moneymaker, but in the past two decades TurboTax, its tax preparation product, has driven the company’s steadily growing profits and made it a Wall Street phenom. When Smith took over in 2008, TurboTax was a market leader, but only a small portion of Americans filed their taxes online. By 2019, nearly 40% of U.S. taxpayers filed online and some 40 million of them did so with TurboTax, far more than with any other product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.1&quot;&gt;But the success of TurboTax rests on a shaky foundation, one that could collapse overnight if the U.S. government did what most wealthy countries did long ago and made tax filing simple and free for most citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.2&quot;&gt;For more than 20 years, Intuit has waged a sophisticated, sometimes covert war to prevent the government from doing just that, according to internal company and IRS documents and interviews with insiders. The company unleashed a battalion of lobbyists and hired top officials from the agency that regulates it. From the beginning, Intuit recognized that its success depended on two parallel missions: stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington. Indeed, employees ruefully joke that the company’s motto should actually be “compromise without integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.3&quot;&gt;Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board-of-directors-presentation-2007.html&quot;&gt;confidential 2007 PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-TurboTax-2014-15-Encroachment-Strategy.html&quot;&gt;manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support&lt;/a&gt;. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.4&quot;&gt;The centerpiece of Intuit’s anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;Since Free File’s launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program’s reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.6&quot;&gt;Twelve years ago, Intuit launched its own “free” product: the similarly named “Free Edition” of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of “free” into paying, some more than $200. Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for “free” prep remains core to the company’s growth. Recently, it launched a “free, free free free” ad campaign for the Free Edition, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6476887-NYT-TurboTax-Free-Crossword.html&quot;&gt;crossword&lt;/a&gt; puzzle in The New York Times in which the answer to every clue was “f-r-e-e.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.7&quot;&gt;Intuit knows it’s deceiving its customers, internal company documents obtained by ProPublica show. “The website lists Free, Free, Free and the customers are assuming their return will be free,” said a company PowerPoint presentation that reported the results of an analysis of customer calls this year. “Customers are getting upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20191017-intuit-slide-Free-Free-Free-slide-highlighted-border.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20191017-intuit-slide-Free-Free-Free-slide-highlighted-border.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20191017-intuit-slide-Free-Free-Free-slide-highlighted-border.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20191017-intuit-slide-Free-Free-Free-slide-highlighted-border.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20191017-intuit-slide-Free-Free-Free-slide-highlighted-border.jpg 2000w&quot;/&gt; An internal Intuit analysis of customer calls this year shows widespread customer confusion about ads for “free” TurboTax. (Highlights added by ProPublica.)
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.0&quot;&gt;Intuit also continues to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes&quot;&gt;“dark patterns”&lt;/a&gt; — design tricks to get users of its website to do things they don’t necessarily mean to do — to ensure that as many customers as possible pay, former employees say. A marketing concept frequently invoked at Intuit, which goes by the acronym “FUD,” seeks to tap into Americans’ fear, uncertainty and doubt about the tax filing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.1&quot;&gt;An Intuit spokesman declined to answer ProPublica’s detailed questions about its efforts to fend off a government filing system, but he provided a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.2&quot;&gt;“We empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, which includes being in charge of their own tax preparation,” he said, adding that a “government-run pre-filled tax preparation system that makes the tax collector (who is also the investigator, auditor and enforcer) the tax preparer is fraught with conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.3&quot;&gt;The IRS is seemingly the biggest threat to Intuit and other commercial tax prep businesses, but it has more frequently acted as the industry’s ally, defending the Free File program even in the face of critical internal reviews. The IRS declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.4&quot;&gt;The consequences of Intuit’s efforts affect a huge proportion of the taxpaying public. Americans spend an estimated 1.7 billion hours and $31 billion doing their taxes each year. Just 2.8 million participated in the Free File program this year, down from 5.1 million at the program’s peak in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;Intuit’s success has made the men who run the company rich. Smith, the CEO who stepped down last year and is now executive board chair, had a stake worth $20 million when he became chief executive. It ballooned to $220 million by last year. Co-founder Scott Cook is now among the country’s wealthiest people, his fortune soaring to $3.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.0&quot;&gt;This year, Intuit was close to realizing a long-held goal: enshrining the Free File program in law, effectively closing the door on the IRS ever creating a free tax filing system. But an outcry followed ProPublica’s reporting on the matter and Intuit’s treatment of its customers, prompting the provision to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax&quot;&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; and state and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/senior-irs-leaders-launch-review-of-partnership-with-turbotax-and-h-r-block&quot;&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-intuit-h-r-block-new-york-regulator-launches-investigation&quot;&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Intuit’s practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.1&quot;&gt;Yet even after this setback, the company remained steadfastly confident that its clout in Washington would win the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.2&quot;&gt;“What we’re not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do,” said Sasan Goodarzi, the new CEO, in a video released to staff this May and obtained by ProPublica. “We are actually working with the IRS and members of the Congress to ensure that the facts are very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.3&quot;&gt;Intuit has dominated the tax software market since 1993, when for $225 million, it bought Chipsoft, the San Diego-based company that had created TurboTax. Even then, TurboTax was the most popular option, but Intuit pursued a plan of aggressive growth. The product necessarily came on a disk, and by the end of the 1990s TurboTax boxes were nearly ubiquitous, on shelves in office supply stores across America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.4&quot;&gt;As internet speeds increased and dot-com mania took hold, it became apparent that Intuit’s future was not in a box on a shelf. It was online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;The prospect of TurboTax’s growth was vast for another reason. As late as 2001, around 45 million Americans still filled out their tax forms on paper. For Intuit, those were all potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.6&quot;&gt;But Intuit wasn’t alone in seeing possibilities in the spread of high-speed internet. In Washington, lawmakers began pushing the IRS to modernize and get more taxpayers to file electronically. It was a no-brainer: Filing taxes online would be easier, and the IRS would save staff costs on processing paper returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.7&quot;&gt;The danger to Intuit’s growing business was obvious. If the government succeeded in creating a system that allowed the vast majority of taxpayers to file online for free, TurboTax profits would plummet. Intuit recognized that the notion of “return-free filing” was not going away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.8&quot;&gt;And so in 1998, the company hired Bernie McKay, a onetime Carter administration aide and a senior lobbyist at AT&amp;amp;T, to be its vice president for corporate affairs. Intuit executives like to talk about having a “customer obsession” in developing their products. McKay’s obsession is stopping government encroachment. Known to physically bang the table to drive home a point, McKay’s style is “aggressive to the point of offense,” said one fellow tax prep lobbyist. An Intuit spokesman said, “This mischaracterization of Mr. McKay is pure fiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.9&quot;&gt;McKay, for his part, when asked at a recent tax industry conference which Star Wars character he is, responded, “Darth Vader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.10&quot;&gt;The year McKay was hired, Congress passed a major overhaul of the IRS. The bill, reflecting Intuit’s lobbying, said that the IRS “should cooperate with and encourage the private sector” to increase electronic filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.11&quot;&gt;While McKay came through in his first big test, in 2002, the company found itself up against an unexpected foe, the George W. Bush administration. The threat came from a broad administration initiative to upgrade government technology. One of the proposals called for the IRS to develop “an easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.12&quot;&gt;Without such an option, taxpayers were stuck either filing on paper or, to file electronically, paying a tax professional or software company like TurboTax. Providing an alternative would be an obvious improvement, said Mark Forman, an official at the Office of Management and Budget who led the “e-government” program. The technology wasn’t all that complicated, and creating a free, automated filing system would help tens of millions of Americans. “This was seen as a low-cost, high-payoff initiative,” Forman recalled in a recent interview with ProPublica. Standing in the way, he said, was an industry “that lives off the complexity of the tax code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.13&quot;&gt;Intuit revved its new lobbying machine. Even before the OMB report was publicly released, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by TurboTax’s hometown congressman, wrote to the agency arguing that there was no reason for the government to “compete” with the “well-established” private tax prep companies. Intuit’s lobbyists also went above the OMB and pressed their case directly to the White House, Forman recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.14&quot;&gt;At the IRS, “all hell broke loose,” remembered Terry Lutes, who was then the head of electronic filing at the agency. Intuit’s clout on the Hill meant that lawmakers were soon accusing the IRS of making “secret plans to undercut the industry,” Lutes said. The agency ran the risk of seeing its funding cut if it were to pursue the Bush plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.15&quot;&gt;The IRS commissioner at the time, Charles Rossotti, also opposed the idea. The IRS’ customer service staff, already too thin to respond adequately to Americans’ questions about the tax code, would have to grow substantially to handle millions of software queries. Congress “will never give you sufficient funding,” Rossotti told ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.16&quot;&gt;So the IRS felt caught in the middle. The question became, Lutes said, “Is there some way to come out of this with something for taxpayers that addresses the administration’s objective and at the same time is acceptable to industry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.17&quot;&gt;Intuit, it turned out, did have a way. Since 1999, as part of the company’s strategy to head off encroachment, TurboTax had been offering free tax prep to the poorest filers.It was a program that served to bolster the company’s arguments that government intervention was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.18&quot;&gt;This became the basis for a deal. The industry would offer free tax prep to a larger portion of taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS would promise not to develop its own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CEO Says Intuit Is Taking Its Case Directly to the IRS and Congress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an internal video, CEO Sasan Goodarzi told Intuit staffers: “What we’re not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HSMQT_gZZY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.0&quot;&gt;Intuit organized a coalition of tax prep companies under the name the Free File Alliance, and after negotiations with the IRS, the group agreed to provide free federal filing to 60% of taxpayers, or about 78 million people at the time. Government officials touted the solution as a marvel of public and private cooperation. Americans would get free tax prep, and it would cost the government almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.1&quot;&gt;For Intuit, it was the culmination of years of lobbying. The IRS had signed a contract that said it “will not compete with the [Free File Alliance] in providing free, online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.2&quot;&gt;What’s more, “free” wasn’t as unprofitable as it sounded. The alliance, guided by a lawyer who was also an Intuit lobbyist, won a series of concessions that made the program palatable to industry. Free File only required the companies to offer free federal returns. They could charge for other products. The state return was the most common, but they could also pitch loans, “audit defense” or even products that had nothing to do with taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.3&quot;&gt;Free File had another bright side: The companies could tailor their Free File offers so that they didn’t cut into their base of paying customers. The agreement said the industry had to offer free federal services to at least 60% of taxpayers, but each company individually only had to cover 10% of taxpayers. Intuit and the others were free to limit their offers of free tax prep by age, income or state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.4&quot;&gt;There was little incentive for the companies to publicize a free alternative to their paid products, and the IRS agreed that the Free File offers need only be listed on a special page of the agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;For Intuit, it was a major victory in the war against encroachment. The company could now focus on turning whatever new customers it acquired through the program into paying users, both that year and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.6&quot;&gt;The first year of Free File was 2003, and for Intuit, things went well. On paper, the Free File Alliance was a collection of 17 companies, all of them vying to serve the American taxpayer. But in reality, it was a group made up of two giants and a bunch of gnats. Intuit’s only significant competitor was H&amp;amp;R Block, and even it was a distant second. The rest of the alliance consisted mostly of tiny companies with names like Free1040TaxReturns.com. As a result, Intuit could tailor its Free File offer just the way it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.7&quot;&gt;But the next year, Intuit began to lose control of its creation. A scrappy competitor, TaxAct, decided to use Free File to stand out. The company decided it would try to pick up as many new customers as possible and then charge them for ancillary services. Instead of following Intuit’s lead and constraining its offer to a subset of low-income taxpayers, TaxAct went the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.8&quot;&gt;“Why not go for an offer that’s much simpler to understand?” is how Lance Dunn, the president of the maker of TaxAct, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6480807-Lance-Dunn-Transcript-Day-2.html#document/p78&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the strategy in a later court hearing. It began advertising a pitch for “free federal online tax preparation and e-filing for all taxpayers. No restrictions. Everyone qualifies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.9&quot;&gt;TurboTax’s offer on the Free File page, meanwhile, was more difficult to parse: “if you are eligible for EIC, are age 22 or younger, age 62 or older, or active Military with a W2.” (EIC stood for the Earned Income Tax Credit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.0&quot;&gt;TaxAct’s ploy was a smashing success. The company’s volume exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.1&quot;&gt;Alarmed, Intuit tried to get the other companies not to offer their products for free to too many potential customers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477791-Lance-Dunn-Transcript.html#document/p50&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Dunn. Such a request could be collusion, a violation of antitrust law, Dunn said. “Intuit asked the Free File Alliance members that we should restrict offers, which I believe is probably not legal for that group to restrain trade,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.2&quot;&gt;ProPublica asked Intuit about Dunn’s accusation, but the company did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.3&quot;&gt;Dunn, who declined to speak with ProPublica, made these remarks during sworn testimony in 2011. The hearing was part of an antitrust case by the Justice Department against H&amp;amp;R Block after it tried to buy TaxAct. The U.S. argued that, by eliminating a competitor, the merger would create a duopoly of Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block. Although the Justice Department ultimately blocked that takeover, the market has grown even more consolidated in recent years. In 2019, according to a ProPublica analysis of IRS data, the two giants accounted for 81% of all individual returns filed using tax prep software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.4&quot;&gt;On the defensive, Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block matched TaxAct’s “no restrictions” offer on Free File. Americans rushed to file for free, and in 2005, 5 million people filed their taxes through the program. Free File had become the most popular way to file taxes online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;Intuit viewed the popularity of Free File as a serious threat and took its case to Congress. That year, Brad Smith, then a senior vice president at the company and head of TurboTax, told a House committee that “the current Free File Alliance program has drifted very far from its original public service purpose and objective,” as he put it. The program wasn’t supposed to be for everyone, he said: It was for the “disadvantaged, underprivileged and underserved taxpayer populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.6&quot;&gt;Intuit’s arguments quickly gained traction at the IRS. Already, in March 2005, the IRS had written to the Justice Department for legal advice on modifying the Free File program. The agency wanted to know: Would it run afoul of antitrust laws if the IRS barred companies in the Free File Alliance from offering a free product to everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.7&quot;&gt;The Justice Department responded in a May 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477776-DoJ-Free-File-Letter-to-IRS.html&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, wrote Renata Hesse, an antitrust section chief at the department, “any agreement among Alliance members to restrict such free service is likely a form of price fixing” and thus illegal. But there was still a way for Intuit to get what it wanted. She wrote that if the IRS itself were to impose such a restriction, it would be legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.8&quot;&gt;The IRS swooped in to beat back Intuit’s competition, doing for Intuit what the company could not on its own. Despite just 5 million Americans using a program that was purportedly available to 80 million, the IRS agreed that Free File needed to be reined in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.0&quot;&gt;The agency made its reasoning clear in a previously unreported letter sent to the Free File Alliance the following year. Bert DuMars, then head of electronic filing at the IRS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477777-IRS-Letter-to-Free-File-Alliance.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that there’d been a huge jump in people using Free File in 2005, but no corresponding boom in people paying for tax prep. “If this trend continued, the IRS was concerned that it could cause many vendors to go out of business,” he wrote. Stock market analysts, he pointed out, had said Free File “represented a threat to future revenues and profits of the publicly traded company participants.” The IRS decided to remove this threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.1&quot;&gt;The new agreement, struck between the IRS and the alliance in 2005, gave Intuit what it had sought. Companies were now expressly barred from offering free tax prep to everyone through the program. Instead, only taxpayers under an income cap, then $50,000 a year, would be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.2&quot;&gt;On paper, the program’s eligibility had actually increased to 70% of taxpayers, or about 93 million households, up from the previous 78 million. But in practice, because broad, easy-to-understand offers were now barred, it was clear the program’s use would decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.3&quot;&gt;Intuit had again bent the power of the federal government in its favor. After 2005, the Free File program was never again as popular, eventually falling to about half that year’s level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.4&quot;&gt;With the threat of government encroachment on ice and high-speed internet access proliferating in the mid-2000s, Intuit looked forward to steady growth and big profits. The upside of the online software business was huge, with the cost of producing each additional unit approaching zero. And TurboTax was hardly a niche product: Intuit executives still excitedly talk about the TAM, total available market, of TurboTax as every single tax filer in the country, now over 150 million households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.5&quot;&gt;But TaxAct’s Free File gambit had forever transformed the industry. Advertising “free” was a great lure, so TaxAct took the battle to a different venue. Barred from making a free offer to everyone through Free File on the IRS’ website, TaxAct decided to make the offer on its own website in 2006. Intuit recognized a credible challenge from the upstart and countered the next year, launching TurboTax Free Edition on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.6&quot;&gt;Confusingly, there were now two distinct options: the government-sponsored Free File and the commercial free editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.7&quot;&gt;For customers who managed to qualify, the new commercial options offered by these companies were similar to what they could get on the IRS’ Free File website: The underlying software was the same, only the federal return was free, and the companies expected to make money on each customer through charging for a state tax return or other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.8&quot;&gt;But for the companies, there was a clear benefit to winning customers directly, rather than through the IRS program. The companies had complete control over how they handled customers from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;14.9&quot;&gt;Intuit poured ad dollars into its Free Edition. Not only did the new product effectively meet TaxAct’s challenge, it quickly became the major driver of TurboTax’s customer growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Intuit Stopped Free File From Spreading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pym-src=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-free-file-annotated?layout=embed&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.0&quot;&gt;That growth posed a challenge: how to, as internal company documents put it, “monetize free.” Over successive tax seasons, Intuit unleashed teams of designers, engineers, marketers and data scientists on that problem, working at its headquarters in Mountain View and TurboTax’s main offices in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.1&quot;&gt;Part of the solution was to pitch users side products like loans or “Audit Defense.” But it also meant misleading customers. Frequently “free” didn’t mean free at all. Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.2&quot;&gt;The company came to a key insight: Americans’ anxiety around tax filing is so powerful that it usually trumps any frustration with the TurboTax product, according to three former Intuit staffers. So even if customers click on “free” and are ultimately asked to pay, they will usually do it rather than start the entire process anew. Intuit capitalized on this tendency by making sure the paywall popped up only when the taxpayer was deep into the filing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.3&quot;&gt;“There’s a lot of desperation — people will agree, will click, will do anything to file,” said a former longtime software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.4&quot;&gt;Every fall before tax season, the company puts every aspect of the TurboTax homepage and filing process through rigorous user testing. Design decisions down to color, word choice and other features are picked to maximize how many customers pay, regardless if they are eligible for the free product. “Dark patterns are something that are spoken of with pride and encouraged in design all hands” meetings, said one former designer. In the design world, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkpatterns.org/&quot;&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;” are tactics to get users to do something they don’t necessarily mean to do. (ProPublica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes&quot;&gt;previously documented&lt;/a&gt; dark patterns encountered by people trying to file their taxes for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.5&quot;&gt;On TurboTax’s homepage, for example, the company carefully chooses how it describes the different editions. Prominently featured next to Deluxe Edition, which costs around $100, is the phrase “maximize your deductions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.6&quot;&gt;If users initially click on the Deluxe software, they are never offered the choice to go to the Free Edition even if the no-cost option would produce the same return. “Maximize your deductions” was legendary at Intuit for its effectiveness in steering customers eligible for free filing to buy the paid product, according to a former marketing staffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intuit's Share Price Has Shot Up in Recent Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pym-src=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-intuit-stock-prices?layout=embed&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.0&quot;&gt;Another celebrated feature, former staffers said, were the animations that appear as TurboTax users prepare their returns. One shows icons representing different tax deductions scrolling by, while another, at the end of the process, shows paper tax forms being scanned line-by-line and the phrase “Let’s comb through your returns.” What users are not told is that these cartoons reflect no actual processing or calculations; rather, Intuit’s designers deliberately added these delays to both reinforce and ease users’ “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.” The animations emphasize that taxes are complicated but also reassure users that the technological wizardry of TurboTax will protect them from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.1&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6476893-Intuit-Statement-to-ProPublica.html&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the Intuit spokesman said, “The process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it. … To offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elements — content, animation, movement, etc. — to ensure our customers’ peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.2&quot;&gt;The 2007 launch of Free Edition started a period of rapid growth for TurboTax. Within two years, use of its web products had almost doubled, and over the past decade, its website has grown each year by an average of 2 million more customers. The company reported this year that TurboTax online had handled 32 million returns. In a statement, it said around a third of that number used Free Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.3&quot;&gt;The government’s Free File program, meanwhile, has mostly faded into the background, drowned out by Intuit’s and other companies’ “free” offers. The IRS did try advertising campaigns, spending around $2 million some years to spread the word. But compared with the reach of Intuit, this was a pittance: The company reported this year that it spent $800 million on advertising. With its budget &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted&quot;&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; by Congress, the IRS has spent no money at all to advertise the program in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.4&quot;&gt;Amid its success, Intuit has sometimes had to put down insurgents bent on reforming the tax filing system. In 2007, the same year Intuit launched its Free Edition, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, took aim at the tax prep industry. In a speech to an audience of tax wonks in Washington, he promised that the IRS would establish a simple return system. “This means no more worry, no more waste of time, no more extra expense for a tax preparer,” he declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.5&quot;&gt;But the Obama administration, as Bush’s had before, found that it was no match for Intuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.6&quot;&gt;Again, Bernie McKay, the lobbyist who had joined Intuit in the late 1990s and outlasted multiple CEOs, led the company’s campaign. In response to the Obama threat, McKay and Intuit’s small army of outside lobbyists turned to Congress, where lawmakers friendly to the company introduced a series of bills that would elevate Free File from a temporary deal with the IRS to the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.7&quot;&gt;Republicans have historically been the company’s most reliable supporters, but some Democrats joined them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/L000397-zoe-lofgren&quot;&gt;Rep. Zoe Lofgren&lt;/a&gt;, the California Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has introduced or co-sponsored five bills over the years that would codify the Free File program, with names like the Free File Permanence Act. Lofgren’s spokesperson told ProPublica that the congresswoman believes the IRS, because of its role as tax collector, should not also be the tax preparer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.0&quot;&gt;Hedging its bets, the company also sought to make sure the IRS could not spend a single dollar creating a public filing system. One internal document says Intuit would “advance legislative language in House Appropriations for ‘No Funds’ restriction on IRS spending” on such a system. It worked. Within a few years, Congress passed a 3,000-page appropriations bill that included a single sentence crucial to Intuit’s financial future: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6396945-PLAW-114publ113.html#document/p190&quot;&gt;No funds&lt;/a&gt;,” the law decreed, could be used “to provide to any person a proposed final return or statement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.1&quot;&gt;Another important aspect of Intuit’s influence strategy during the Obama years was covertly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;enlisting&lt;/a&gt; minority and women’s groups to press its case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.2&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-TurboTax-2014-15-Encroachment-Strategy.html&quot;&gt;internal 2014-15 “encroachment strategy” document&lt;/a&gt; discloses plans to “leverage trade groups to support House/Senate Free File bills.” It goes on to list the groups Women Impacting Public Policy, The Latino Coalition and the National Black Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.3&quot;&gt;Intuit has given money to all of those groups over the years. All have signed letters urging Congress to make the Free File deal permanent. “The Free File program has been a clear success,” said one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atr.org/conservative-coalition-free-file-solution-tax-complexity&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by The Latino Coalition and the Hispanic Leadership Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.4&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for Women Impacting Public Policy said it has received $70,000 from Intuit. The amounts given to the other groups are unknown, and they did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.5&quot;&gt;Company documents also outline plans to “mobilize” a “coalition” that included think tanks and academics, who published op-eds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.6&quot;&gt;Will Marshall, president of the pro-business Progressive Policy Institute, opposed return-free filing in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/293095-return-free-filing-proposal-is-not-tax-reform&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in The Hill because doing one’s taxes is “a teachable moment [that] prompts us to review our financial circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.7&quot;&gt;Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, the most consistent champion of Intuit’s policy positions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atr.org/taxpayer-advocates-issue-joint-free-file-a7496&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that “big spenders in Washington, D.C. want to socialize all tax preparation in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.8&quot;&gt;It is unclear whether they were paid by Intuit or the Free File Alliance. Norquist didn’t respond to a request for comment, and a Progressive Policy Institute spokesman declined to say whether Intuit gave the group money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.9&quot;&gt;Whatever external challenges to the status quo Intuit has faced, the company has been able to rely on the IRS’ continuing enthusiastic support of the Free File program. Every few years, the IRS and the industry got together to renew the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.10&quot;&gt;In part, that was due to the relationships Intuit had developed with high-ranking IRS officials. One, Dave Williams, served as the agency’s top negotiator on the Free File program for several years and “was very commercially sensitive,” said Mark Ernst, the CEO of H&amp;amp;R Block until 2007. Ernst, who later held a senior role at the IRS, told ProPublica that Williams “didn’t want to offend the industry,” noting that “he was particularly open to having sidebar conversations with key people where he could imagine himself landing some day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.11&quot;&gt;Today, Williams works at Intuit, where he’s held the title of chief tax officer since 2013. He is one of several former IRS employees who have gone on to work there. In a statement, Williams told ProPublica he did not have discussions about future employment with Intuit or other companies until after he left the IRS. He added that his career in government was focused on “what is best for the taxpayer” and that he “joined Intuit for the same reason: to help the American taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.12&quot;&gt;Despite Free File’s declining use, the IRS often claimed that the program was nevertheless meeting one of its original goals: driving more people to file electronically instead of on paper. Ernst, who served as a senior official at the IRS from 2009 to 2010, didn’t believe that a program used by so few people was having any such effect. “It was a talking point that got trotted out all the time to justify the Free File Alliance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.13&quot;&gt;Internally, IRS managers have also argued that the program is, in a way, a success, because it created “a free marketplace,” as one internal management report in 2017 put it. Apparently, customers weren’t the only ones taken in by the word “free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.14&quot;&gt;In 2018, Intuit faced rare scrutiny from inside the IRS. The agency asked its Advisory Council, a group of outside experts, to take stock of Free File. To the company’s alarm, it soon became apparent that the council’s report might be sharply critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.15&quot;&gt;That July, council chair and University of California, Davis, law professor Dennis Ventry wrote two pieces criticizing an Intuit-backed bill in Congress that would make the program permanent. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/395762-free-file-providers-scam-taxpayers-congress-cant-be-fooled&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in The Hill was called, “Free File providers scam taxpayers; Congress shouldn’t be fooled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.16&quot;&gt;In response, the IRS again rose to Intuit’s aid. It rushed to assure the company that Ventry’s power to affect the program was limited, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p14&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; to the Free File Alliance obtained through a public records request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.17&quot;&gt;“The Commissioner has met directly with Mr. Ventry,” IRS official Ken Corbin wrote to Steve Ryan, a lobbyist for Intuit who also represented the alliance. “Mr. Ventry will recuse himself from participating or contributing to the topic of Free File.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.18&quot;&gt;Corbin heads the IRS division that processes most Americans’ tax returns and negotiates the Free File deal with Intuit and the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.19&quot;&gt;A few days later, Ryan arrived at the IRS’ Constitution Avenue headquarters in Washington to mount a defense of the program. A former Democratic Senate aide turned lawyer-lobbyist, Ryan is known on Capitol Hill for taking on politically fraught clients, including Trump attorney Michael Cohen and the government of Qatar. He helped create Free File in the early 2000s, and it was now his job to secure its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.0&quot;&gt;Ryan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6030111-FFA-PPT-Presentation-to-IRSAC-July-2018.html#document/p8&quot;&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; presentation at the IRS rehashed arguments that the company had been making for the past 15 years. It also highlighted a 2013 study by Brown University professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/John_Friedman/&quot;&gt;John Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, a former Obama National Economic Council official, to make the point that the program had been successful in generating “Free Tax Returns &lt;strong&gt;Outside&lt;/strong&gt; of Free File.” The presentation did not mention that Friedman’s study was paid for by the Free File companies and was not published in an academic journal. Friedman declined to say what he was paid but told ProPublica he “wrote the piece based on my analysis of the issues, which I stand by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.1&quot;&gt;Ventry, who attended the meeting, got a call the next day alerting him that a California public records request had been filed for his emails — they were subject to such a request because he’s an employee of a state university. It came from the Free File Alliance, as The New York Times later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/freedom-of-information-requests.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The request, Ventry believes, was designed to “freak me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.2&quot;&gt;In early October, the council sent a version of its final report, which included a harsh appraisal of the Free File program, to the IRS to seek responses before releasing it publicly the following month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.3&quot;&gt;But in mid-October, just weeks before the report saw the light of day, the Free File industry group fired off an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p9&quot;&gt;urgent&lt;/a&gt;” request to meet with IRS officials. The goal was to re-sign and “improve” the memorandum of understanding that governed the Free File program, according to the emails. The current agreement wasn’t expiring for another two years, but Ryan cited the “time urgency to make changes that will benefit taxpayers” in the coming tax season, adding, “I have not darkened your door in 2018 and need your … attention to this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.4&quot;&gt;The IRS’ Corbin signed the new deal on Oct. 31. Two weeks later, the Advisory Council report was released, with a damning indictment of the program: “The IRS’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5910811-Internal-Revenue-Service-Advisory-Council.html#document/p15&quot;&gt;deficient oversight&lt;/a&gt; and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk,” the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.5&quot;&gt;The expert body recommended that the IRS negotiate a series of new provisions designed to increase the use and oversight of the program, including mandating advertising by the companies. But it was too late. A new deal had already been signed with modest changes. As it had in the past, Intuit and the alliance had effectively insulated the program from reform. Members of the council, Ventry said, were “pissed off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.6&quot;&gt;A spokesman for the Free File Alliance said the group had pushed to renegotiate the deal in 2018 because of the looming 2020 presidential campaign. “The reason for the timing of the extension of the agreement was the political season,” he said. The group had not seen the report before its release, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.7&quot;&gt;(In August, ProPublica sued the IRS to get more correspondence between the agency and Intuit’s lobbyists. In response to our Freedom of Information Act requests, the agency has withheld over 100 pages. The case is ongoing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.8&quot;&gt;The new deal included rules that barred Free File companies from offering extra products to the relatively small number of users who access the program. This makes it much more difficult to convert those users into paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;24.0&quot;&gt;At around the same time, the industry took steps to make the program more difficult to find. Both Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block added code to their Free File websites that shielded them from search engines such as Google. The Intuit spokesman said the company increased paid search advertising for Free File “by nearly 80 percent” over the last year and has data showing more people found the program through online search this year than last year, but he declined to provide specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;24.1&quot;&gt;What is clear is that Intuit’s business relies on keeping the use of Free File low. The company has repeatedly declined to say how many of its paying customers are eligible for the program, which is currently open to anyone who makes under $66,000. But based on publicly available data and statements by Intuit executives, ProPublica estimates that roughly 15 million paying TurboTax customers could have filed for free if they found Free File. That represents more than $1.5 billion in estimated revenue, or more than half the total that TurboTax generates. Those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/here-are-your-stories-of-being-tricked-into-paying-by-turbotax-you-often-need-the-money&quot;&gt;affected&lt;/a&gt; include retirees, students, people on disability and minimum-wage workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;24.2&quot;&gt;Customers, meanwhile, remain confused by Intuit’s myriad uses of “free,” and internal documents show the company knows it. Over just a two-week period this past filing season, Intuit received nearly 7,000 TurboTax customer calls in which the phrase “supposed to be free” was uttered, according to a company analysis. One customer complained that Intuit charged him even though “it says ‘free free free’ on the commercial.” The TurboTax representative responded: “That ad has been the bane of my existence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;24.3&quot;&gt;Even as TurboTax’s business thrived, 2019 has been a rocky year for Intuit’s long-running war against government encroachment. In April, the company was close to finally succeeding in its long-held goal to make Free File permanent. A bill called the Taxpayer First Act was sailing toward almost unanimous approval in Congress. But after ProPublica published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of stories about the program, including a story showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-military-discount-trick-troops-paying-to-file-taxes&quot;&gt;military families&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-law-threatened-turbotax-profits-started-charging-disabled-unemployed-and-students&quot;&gt;students&lt;/a&gt; were particularly affected by Intuit’s business tactics, the bill stalled. Congress ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the provision that would have enshrined Free File in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;25.0&quot;&gt;After having enabled Intuit for so long, the IRS finally responded to the pressure. It hired a contractor to review the Free File program. But the contractor had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-funded-review-confirms-turbotax-hid-free-filing-from-search-engines-but-says-theres-no-need-for-major-changes&quot;&gt;previously argued&lt;/a&gt; against the IRS offering its own tax prep option, and the review did not recommend major changes. The agency has not yet announced its plans for the future of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;25.1&quot;&gt;The agency’s inspector general also launched an audit, which is ongoing. Other investigations and litigation followed, ranging from class-action complaints, alleging that consumers had been deceived by Intuit’s tactics, to investigations and lawsuits by regulators and prosecutors in New York and California. Intuit has denied wrongdoing, saying it “has at all times been clear and fair with its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;27.0&quot;&gt;Despite the scrutiny, Wall Street has continued to embrace the company’s business model. The company recently announced it made $1.5 billion in profits for its fiscal year. It expects its TurboTax unit to grow by 10% next year. Last year the CEO was paid $20 million. The share price hit an all-time record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;27.1&quot;&gt;The company has returned to its old strategy: stay the course and take its case directly to the IRS and Congress. Its allies in the Senate have again advanced an appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from developing its own tax filing system. In the spring, Sasan Goodarzi, a former head of the TurboTax unit who took over as CEO of the entire company in January, sought to reassure employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;27.2&quot;&gt;“Our view is this will be in the press until there is a resolution with the IRS,” he said, according to the video obtained ProPublica. “And we’re working with them and we feel very good about where this will end.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Aquameta: Web development platform built in PostgreSQL</title>
<link>https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquameta is a web-based IDE for full-stack web development. Developers can manage HTML, CSS, Javascript, database schema, views, templates, routes, tests and documentation, and do version control, branching, pushing, pulling, user management and permissions, all from a single web-based IDE. In theory. And mostly in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Aquameta is a &quot;datafied&quot; web stack, built entirely in PostgreSQL. The structure of a typical web framework is represented in Aquameta as big database schema with 6 postgreSQL schemas containing ~60 tables, ~50 views and ~90 stored procedures. Apps developed in Aquameta are represented entirely as relational data, and all development, at an atomic level, is some form of data manipulation. Also in theory. And mostly in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquameta is an experimental project, still in early stages of development. It is not suitable for production development and should not be used in an untrusted or mission-critical environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Core Extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquameta contains seven core PostgreSQL extensions, which together make up the web stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/meta&quot;&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt; - Writable system catalog for PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/bundle&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/a&gt; - A version control system similar to git but for database rows intead of files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/filesystem&quot;&gt;filesystem&lt;/a&gt; - A bi-directional file system integration system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/event&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; - Pub/sub data change events API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/endpoint&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/a&gt; - Maps PostgreSQL permissions and data acccess to the web, as well as allowing resource hosting and a web socket event server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/widget&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt; - Modular web components that can be reused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/src/pg-extension/semantics&quot;&gt;semantics&lt;/a&gt; - A metadata layer on top of the database schema, for binding columns and relations to widgets, decorating keys, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquameta is most easily installed on a Ubuntu 18 or Debian 9 instance; its installer manages dependencies by as &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install, setup a clean Ubuntu 18 or Debian 9 instance. You can run on bare metal, or using a virtual machine such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_18-04_virtualbox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; on Mac OSX and Windows, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxconfig.org/install-and-set-up-kvm-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt; on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your Linux machine is setup, acquire the Aquameta package by either downloading the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/releases&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, or to try the bleeding edge version, clone the repository. Then run the install script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd aquameta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;./install.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquameta has been the life project of Eric Hanson for close to 20 years off-and-on. Functional prototypes have been developed in XML, RDF and MySQL, but PostgreSQL is the first database discovered that has the functionality necessary to achieve something close to practical, and huge advances in web technology like WebRTC, ES6 modules, and more have shown some light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical goals of the project include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow complete management of the database using only INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands (expose the DDL as DML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control of relational data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote push/pull of commits to relational VCS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access and manipulate the database as a file system from the command prompt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access and manipulate the file system as relational data from the SQL prompt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interal event system for pub/sub of changes to tables, columns or rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modular web interface components (&quot;widgets&quot;) made of HTML, CSS, Javascript, that are self-contained, manage their own dependencies, accept input arguments, can instantiate other widgets, and can emit events that other widgets can subscribe to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Semantic decoration&quot; allows the user to associate UI components with schema components (relations, columns, data types), auto-generate simple CRUD UIs, and progressively enhance a UI by overriding sensible defaults with custom widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pub/sub notification let peers download new content from each other as it comes available without polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users communicate with each other by exchanging structured, relational data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized P2P network with no single point of failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralize the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deprecate the file system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach people to speak the language of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert word-based knowledge and information to structured knowledge and information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretch a net of approximate categorization across our earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Stupid Unix Tricks</title>
<link>https://sneak.berlin/20191011/stupid-unix-tricks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sneak.berlin/20191011/stupid-unix-tricks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;These are my stupid unix tricks. I hope that they are useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Mac OS X (pron: “ten”). If you don’t, you might want to switch instances of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Library/&lt;/code&gt; to something else, like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.local/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, first note that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bashrc&lt;/code&gt; refers to something that runs in each and every new shell, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt; refers to something that runs &lt;em&gt;only in login shells&lt;/em&gt; (spawned by your terminal, not just a shell script, for example). They aren’t the same and you don’t want them to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of software or configurations want to run some stuff each new shell. You want to add aliases and functions to your shell environment. Manually editing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; is a drag, as is grepping it to determine programmatically if it’s been modified in a specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/bashrc.d ~/Library/profile.d
touch ~/Library/bashrc.d/000.keep.sh
touch ~/Library/profile.d/000.keep.sh
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bashrc &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'
# do not edit this file. put files in the dir below.
for FN in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/Library/bashrc.d/*.sh ; do
    source &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$FN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&quot;
done
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/.profile &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'
# do not edit this file. put files in the dir below.
source ~/.bashrc
for FN in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/Library/profile.d/*.sh ; do
    source &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$FN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&quot;
done
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use standard tools like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if [[ -e $HOME/Library/bashrc.d/111.whatever.sh ]];&lt;/code&gt; to add/test/remove things from your shell environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sneak@pris:~/Library/bashrc.d$ grep . 100*
100.caskroom-dest.sh:export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=&quot;--appdir=$HOME/Applications&quot;
100.gopath.sh:export GOPATH=&quot;$HOME/Library/Go&quot;
100.homebrew-no-spyware.sh:export HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1
100.homebrew-paths.sh:export PATH+=&quot;:$HOME/Library/Homebrew/bin&quot;
100.homebrew-paths.sh:export PATH+=&quot;:$HOME/Library/Homebrew/sbin&quot;
100.localbin.sh:export PATH+=&quot;:$HOME/Library/Local/bin&quot;
100.localbin.sh:export PATH+=&quot;:$HOME/Library/Local/sbin&quot;
100.yarnpaths.sh:export PATH+=&quot;:$HOME/.yarn/bin&quot;  # homebrew's yarn installs to here
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefix them with numbers so that they sort and run in order; e.g. you want your bin paths (for python, yarn, et c) added to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; before you start trying to run things from within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you synchronize a directory (e.g. via dropbox/gdrive, or, better yet, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like I do). My &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# do not edit this file. put files in the dir below.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;FN &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/Library/bashrc.d/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.sh &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$FN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done

for &lt;/span&gt;FN &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/Documents/sync/bashrc.d/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.sh &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$FN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way I can add aliases and environment variables in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/sync/bashrc.d/&lt;/code&gt; and they magically appear on all of my machines without additional configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrap your startup script commands in checks to prevent errors if things aren’t installed or available, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to install things with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; is not installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;which brew &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
    &lt;/span&gt;brew install jq
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; only if the directory exists on the machine in question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/dev/go&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/dev/go&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way you can put things that need to happen into startup scripts (e.g. installation of jq for subsequent commands in the script to work) and they won’t error out if files or directories aren’t installed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example (from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/sync/bashrc.d/999.kubectl.sh&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loads bash completion for kubectl, but only on systems that have kubectl installed and in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;which kubectl &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl completion bash&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ssh key on disk, even with a passphrase, is vulnerable to malware (malware can steal your files, and keylog your passphrase to decrypt them). Put your ssh private keys somewhere that software (any software, even your own) on your computer simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to store SSH private keys is in a hardware security module, or HSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a Yubikey 4C Nano (though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-YubiKey-Factor-Authentication-Security/dp/B07HBTBJ5S&quot;&gt;Yubikey 5C Nano&lt;/a&gt; is current now), via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt;. I have one physically installed in each computer I regularly use, plus a few spares stashed in safe places offsite. I generated the keys on the devices, did not back them up at generation time (so now they can’t ever be exported from the devices at all), and each device has its own unique key. (They have the added benefit of serving as U2F tokens for web authentication, something you &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; should be using everywhere you can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; is a small daemon that is part of GnuPG that runs locally and allows you to use a GnuPG key as an SSH key. GnuPG supports using a smartcard as a GnuPG key. Yubikeys can serve as GnuPG-compatible &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CCID&lt;/code&gt; smartcards. This means that your Yubikey, in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CCID&lt;/code&gt; mode, can be used to authenticate to SSH servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To initialize a key on the card, use the instructions found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engineerbetter.com/blog/yubikey-ssh/&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;. I do not recommend setting an expiration (as they suggest) and don’t put your real name/email on the GnuPG keys it generates, as these are not going to be used for normal GnuPG-style things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of that tutorial has a slightly different (perhaps better) take on what to put in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; to use the card for ssh. Mine is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set it up to use your GPG smartcard to authenticate to remote hosts by dropping a file in your modular &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;profile.d&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/profile.d/900.gpg-agent.sh &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'
# check for existing running agent info
if [[ -e &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info ]]; then
    source &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info
    export GPG_AGENT_INFO SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID
fi

# test existing agent, remove info file if not working
ssh-add -L 2&amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;gt;/dev/null || rm -f &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info

# if no info file, start up potentially-new, working agent
if [[ ! -e &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info ]]; then
    if which gpg-agent &amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 ; then
        gpg-agent \
            --enable-ssh-support \
            --daemon \
            --pinentry-program &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/bin/pinentry-mac \
            2&amp;gt; /dev/null &amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info
    fi
fi

# load up new agent info
if [[ -e &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info ]]; then
    source &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/.gpg-agent-info
    export GPG_AGENT_INFO SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID
fi
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have generated a key on your card and started the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; correctly, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh-add -L | grep cardno&lt;/code&gt; will show you the ssh public key from the key on your Yubikey, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sneak@pris:~$ ssh-add -L | grep cardno
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA....VCBZawcIANQ== cardno:000601231234
sneak@pris:~$
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the GnuPG public keys from all the cards and export them as a single ascii-armored bundle (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpg -a --export $KEYIDS &amp;gt; keys.txt&lt;/code&gt;) which you save somewhere easily accessible. You can then use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sneak/hacks/blob/master/bin/encrypt-for-sneak&quot;&gt;tool like mine&lt;/a&gt; to easily encrypt data for safekeeping that you will always be able to decrypt should you have at least one of your HSMs around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two options, github or self-hosted. The github option has some drawbacks, but is fine for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add all of your ssh public keys from your various HSMs (you should have one for each computer you type on) to your GitHub account. GitHub publishes everyone’s public keys at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://github.com/username.keys&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sneak.keys&quot;&gt;here’s mine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on new systems, simply paste this line (substituting your own username, of course):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ~/.ssh
curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-sf&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/sneak.keys &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be tempted to crontab this like I was, so that the keys on all of your machines are automatically updated on adds/removes to the master list. If you do so, you give anyone who controls the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt; domain the ability to add ssh keys to your machines automatically. You may or may not be okay with this—I am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you do end up running it from cron, be sure to check the return value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; before replacing the file (i.e. don’t use the line above unmodified), because then if the network is down when cron runs it will clobber your file and not refill it, rendering your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to have ssh keys that have access to GitHub (non HSM keys, such as on my Pixelbook which sadly doesn’t support Linux USB passthrough for the Yubikey smartcard) that don’t also have root on my machines, so I maintain a separate list on my own website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sneak.cloud/authorized_keys&quot;&gt;https://sneak.cloud/authorized_keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on new boxes, I just paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir .ssh
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; .ssh
mv authorized_keys authorized_keys.orig
wget https://sneak.cloud/authorized_keys
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker desktop for mac is &lt;em&gt;closed source software&lt;/em&gt;, which is dumb for something that asks for administrator permissions on your local machine. This lameness aside, it runs the docker daemon (not the command line client) inside a linux VM which it runs on your local machine, which is probably a relatively slow laptop on a not-great internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many big, fast computers on 1 or 10 gigabit connections that I can use via SSH that are better for building docker images or testing Dockerfiles (I do all of my editing and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;ing and suchlike on my local workstation, because my signing keys and editor config are all here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/bashrc.d/999.remote-docker.sh &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;'
alias ber1.docker=&quot;/bin/rm -f &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TMPDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/docker.sock; ssh -nNT -L &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TMPDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock root@ber1.example.com ; export DOCKER_HOST=unix://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TMPDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;/docker.sock&quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding uses ssh to forward a local unix socket (a type of special file) to a remote server (in this example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ber1.example.com&lt;/code&gt;), with which your local &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; command can use to talk to a remote docker server (via locating the socket in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DOCKER_HOST&lt;/code&gt; environment variable). You’ll want to change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ber1.docker&lt;/code&gt; part to whatever you want the command to be to enable your remote docker, and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root@ber1.example.com&lt;/code&gt; part to the username and hostname of the remote machine you wish to use. (It needs to be running ssh and docker already.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you run one of those aliases (they have to be aliases instead of scripts because they need to modify the environment of your existing, running shell) you should be able to use all normal docker commands (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker push&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker build -t username/image /path/to/dir&lt;/code&gt;) just as if you were on the docker host itself. This makes it pretty simple to do a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker build .&lt;/code&gt; in a directory in which you’ve been hacking, but leveraging all of the power of a big, fast machine in a datacenter. You’ve never seen &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt update&lt;/code&gt; in your Dockerfile go so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security warning: anyone who can read and write from the local socket on your workstation (probably just you, but worth mentioning) has root on the remote server, as API access to a remote docker daemon is equivalent, from a security and practical standpoint, to root on the docker host itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update! Better yet! HN user &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=11235813213455&quot;&gt;11235813213455&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21284157&quot;&gt;writes to say&lt;/a&gt; that you can simply set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DOCKER_HOST&lt;/code&gt; to an ssh url starting in docker 18.09!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://root@remotehost.example.com
docker ps
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, to persist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;echo 'export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://root@remotehost.example.com' &amp;gt; ~/Library/bashrc.d/999.remote-docker.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sneak/hacks&quot;&gt;a git repository called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hacks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into which I commit any non-secret code, scripts, snippets, or supporting tooling that isn’t big or important or generic enough to warrant its own repo. This is a good way to get all the little junk you work on up onto a website without creating a billion repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might use gmail and access it with a mail client via IMAP. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offlineimap.org/&quot;&gt;offlineimap&lt;/a&gt; to periodically back it up to files in a local maildir-format directory, so that if your Google account should evaporate through no fault of your own, you don’t lose decades of email. (Sync it to other machines via &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to avoid losing data via disk crash or hardware theft, or put it somewhere that your local workstation backups will pick it up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I back up my local machine to a remote (encrypted disk) server via SSH using rsync via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sneak/hacks/blob/master/osxbackup/rsyncbackup.command&quot;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt;. It looks at the environment variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$BACKUPDEST&lt;/code&gt; to figure out where to do the backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a remote ssh backup, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'export BACKUPDEST=&quot;remoteuser@remotehost.example.com:/path/to/destination&quot;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/bashrc.d/999.backup-destination.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a local drive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'export BACKUPDEST=&quot;/Volumes/externaldisk/mybackup&quot;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/bashrc.d/999.backup-destination.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use the above script. Copy it to your local machine and edit the backup exclusions as required for your use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you trust other companies with your data and want something more user-friendly, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/&quot;&gt;BackBlaze&lt;/a&gt;, as they’re cheap and excellent and offer unlimited storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I also use the macOS built-in backup called Time Machine to back up to an external USB drive periodically, but I don’t trust it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my first-line defense against data loss, my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; backups are my second, and the Time Machine backups are just a safety net.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; in my home directory (really just a symlink to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/dev/hacks/homedir.makefile/Makefile&lt;/code&gt;; it officially lives in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hacks&lt;/code&gt; repository) that I use to store common tasks related to my local machine (many of which are somewhat out of date, I note now on review).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one I use most often, though, is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt;, which takes everything in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Desktop&lt;/code&gt; and moves it into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/$YYYYMM&lt;/code&gt; (creating the month directory in the process if it doesn’t exist), and also empties trashes. This alone is worth the price of admission to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sneak/hacks/blob/master/homedir.makefile/Makefile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github.com/sneak/hacks/homedir.makefile/Makefile&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should prune it of old/outdated commands and update it for my current/latest backup configuration. In my ideal world, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; in my home directory would empty trashes, clean up the desktop, download/mirror all my IMAP email to local directories, then run a full backup to a remote host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a symlink, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/dev&lt;/code&gt;, in my home directory, that points to a subdirectory of my synced folder, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/sync&lt;/code&gt;, into which I check out any code I’m working on. I rarely edit code outside of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/dev&lt;/code&gt;. This way, even if I don’t remember to commit and push, my current working copies are synced shortly after save to several other machines. I wouldn’t lose much if you threw any of my machines in the river at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-config-file&quot;&gt;SSH: Config FIle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ssh client config lives at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user ssh client config file is amazing, and you should be using it extensively. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh_config(5)&lt;/code&gt; has more info (run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;man 5 ssh_config&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the basic format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host specific.example.com
        SpecificHostnameParameter

Host *.example.com
        ExampleDotComParameter
        ExampleDotComParameter

Host *
        GlobalParameter
        GlobalParameter
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, you can specify new default settings for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; ssh commands, and then override them on a specific wildcard/host basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. to always ssh as root:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host *
    User root
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that (I’m told) ssh will read each setting &lt;em&gt;in the order it is found in the file&lt;/em&gt;, without later items being allowed to override previous ones, so specify them from most-specific to most-generic (putting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Host *&lt;/code&gt; at the end), allowing host- or domain-specific items to come before your defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-move-your-ssh-config-file-into-a-synced-folder&quot;&gt;SSH: Move Your SSH Config File Into a Synced Folder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/sync&lt;/code&gt; is a synced directory that replicates automatically across all my workstations using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt;. (You should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net/&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/a&gt;.) You could also use Google Drive or Dropbox if you want to give third parties that much control over your machine, or knowledge of your hostnames/habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ~/Documents/sync/dotfiles
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/Documents/sync/dotfiles/ssh_config
ln &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; ~/Documents/sync/dotfiles/ssh_config ~/.ssh/config
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other machines, just:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rm ~/.ssh/config
ln &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; ~/Documents/sync/dotfiles/ssh_config ~/.ssh/config
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, settings changes for ssh automatically propagate to all workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could do the same for your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt; file to sync host key fingerprints between all of your machines, too, but I don’t bother, as I find TOFU sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-faster-crypto&quot;&gt;SSH: Faster Crypto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the following in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Host *&lt;/code&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host *
        Cipher aes128-ctr
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my understanding that the counter mode is more efficient on modern, multicore CPUs, as it is easier to parallelize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-persistent-connections&quot;&gt;SSH: Persistent Connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the following in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Host *&lt;/code&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host *
        ControlPath ~/.ssh/%C.sock
        ControlMaster auto
        ControlPersist 10m
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you use %C (hash of username+hostname) as the filename token instead of %h (hostname) or whatever other stuff other tutorials on the internet told you, I ran into issues using the other format, whereas this uses just [a-f0-9] in the first part of the filename.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will maintain a connection to each host you ssh into for 10 minutes after idle. Any future ssh connections while the first is open (or within that 10 minute window) will re-use the existing TCP connection, which speeds things up a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security notice: anyone who can write to these socket files (probably just you) has full access to the hosts to which they are connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-rewrite-hostnames&quot;&gt;SSH: Rewrite Hostnames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have some machines that aren’t in DNS, or have stupid hostnames that you can’t remember? Using IPs is a terrible smell that you should always avoid. Rewrite them by overriding their connection hostname:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host workbox.example.com
        HostName 2.3.4.5

Host otherbox
    Port 11022
    User ec2_user
        HostName real-hostname-is-long-and-dumb.clients.hostingprovider.su
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh otherbox&lt;/code&gt;. Sure beats &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh -p 11022 ec2_user@real-hostname-is-long-and-dumb.clients.hostingprovider.su&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, your ssh config file functions as a sort of local dns database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-proxycommand&quot;&gt;SSH: ProxyCommand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProxyCommand&lt;/code&gt; directive to tell ssh how to get i/o to a remote ssh service, skipping the whole direct TCP connection process entirely. You can use this for connecting transparently via a bastion host, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host *.internal.corplan
        ProxyCommand ssh user@bastionhost.example.com nc %h %p
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the preceding will result in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh box1.internal.corplan&lt;/code&gt; sshing as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bastionhost.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and running netcat with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc box1.internal.corplan 22&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%p&lt;/code&gt; are replaced with the destination host and port of the “main” ssh, i.e. the ones you typed or implied on the command line (box1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a nice organized corporate naming scheme, or even DNS at all, you can hardcode the values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# 2.3.4.5 is the bastion host
Host box2.internal.corplan
        ProxyCommand ssh myuser@2.3.4.5 nc 10.0.1.102 22

Host box3.internal.corplan
    Username appuser
        ProxyCommand ssh myuser@2.3.4.5 nc 10.0.1.103 22
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, combine them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host bastion.corpext
    HostName 2.3.4.5
    User myuser

Host box2.internal.corplan
        ProxyCommand ssh bastion.corpext nc 10.0.1.102 22

Host box3.internal.corplan
        ProxyCommand ssh bastion.corpext nc 10.0.1.103 22
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; (netcat) to illustrate the example, but it turns out that the ssh command has the functionality built in (as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-W&lt;/code&gt;), removing the need to have netcat installed (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; tells it not to allocate a pty):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host box2.internal.corplan
        ProxyCommand ssh user@2.3.4.5 -T -W 10.0.1.10:22
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of setting up key-based SSH and configuring your hosts in your ssh client config file is that then commands such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsync -avP ./localdirectory/ otherhost:/path/to/dest/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..will “just work”, even if the machine is behind a bastion host, or needs a special SSH port, or a different username, or even if it’s accessed via tor. You no longer need to think about the specifics of each ssh host (other than the hostname), it just lives in your config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also allows you to use the ssh/scp support in your &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; editor (vim does this, for example) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Editing_remote_files_via_scp_in_vim&quot;&gt;edit files on remote machines (in a local editor without keyboard lag)&lt;/a&gt; that might be a pain in the ass to ssh into due to being behind firewalls or bastion hosts, or on weird ports. Put the specifics in the config file, then it’s as simple as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim scp://internalbox1.example.com//etc/samba/smb.conf&lt;/code&gt; (two slashes between hostname and absolute path for vim’s scp support, mind you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-easy-access-with-tor&quot;&gt;SSH: Easy Access With Tor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tor&lt;/code&gt; on boxes I administrate, and set up a hidden service running on them for ssh, because then I can ssh into them (albeit slowly) even if they have all inbound ports firewalled, or are behind NAT, or whatever—no port forwarding required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-up-hidden-service&quot;&gt;Set Up Hidden Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install tor on the server, add the following two lines to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/tor/torrc&lt;/code&gt;, restart tor, and now you have a hidden service address for that system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;apt update &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; apt install &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; tor
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /etc/tor/torrc &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/my-ssh/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;service tor restart
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; /var/lib/tor/my-ssh/hostname
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want the ssh service to be reachable even from the lan/wan (only via the hidden service), add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ListenAddress 127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; and bounce sshd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;connect-to-hidden-service&quot;&gt;Connect To Hidden Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the following to work, you have to be running tor on your local machine too (which provides a SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1:9050).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two parts are required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host *.tor
     ProxyCommand nc -x 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for each host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host zeus.tor
    User myuser
    Hostname ldlktrhkwerjhtkexample.onion
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I can just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh zeus.tor&lt;/code&gt; and it will match the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProxyCommand&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*.tor&lt;/code&gt; to use netcat to talk to the local SOCKS proxy provided by the tor daemon on localhost to connect to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt;, and then it will pick up the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; hostname and username to use for that specific box from the full host string match &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zeus.tor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually use my ssh config file as my master record of the onion hostnames of my machines. (This is one reason why syncing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt; is vastly preferred to using a file syncing service that gives third parties access to your files. I would prefer that nobody know what hidden services I am interested in or are associated with me, for privacy’s sake.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-forward-public-port-to-local-server&quot;&gt;SSH: Forward Public Port To Local Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever want to access a machine behind several NATs/firewalls from a publicly-acessible port? You can use this for access to SSH, or any other service running on the ssh client machine, like a development webserver. First, set up unattended key authentication between the target machine (behind the firewall) to the public machine that is reachable, probably by generating an ssh key without a password on the target machine and creating an unprivileged user on the public machine and adding that public key to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; for that unprivileged user. The public machine also needs to have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GatewayPorts yes&lt;/code&gt; in its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; (which is not the default), so it requires a little configuration change to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, set the following command to run continuously (via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh -T -R 0.0.0.0:11022:127.0.0.1:22 user@publichost&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, this would make port 11022 on the public host (externally available) connect to the target machine’s ssh port (22) as long as the ssh command is running. This is a quick hack to publish a service behind firewalls or on your local workstation accessible, along the lines of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt; does, but by re-using a server you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expose a local development webserver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh -T -R 0.0.0.0:80:127.0.0.1:8080 root@publichost&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You need to use root to bind to ports under 1024, such as 80.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernotes.io/simple-recipe-forwarding-webhooks-local-development-environment/&quot;&gt;Nicholas at hackernotes.io has more information on the technique&lt;/a&gt;, including a way to restrict this type of remote port binding to a specific user.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla’s 18-month effort to market without Facebook</title>
<link>https://digiday.com/marketing/after-mozilla-stopped-spending-on-facebook-the-company-increased-its-focus-on-offline-marketing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://digiday.com/marketing/after-mozilla-stopped-spending-on-facebook-the-company-increased-its-focus-on-offline-marketing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to data privacy, Mozilla has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/uk/what-firefoxs-anti-tracking-update-signals-about-wider-pivot-to-privacy-trend/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;been vigilant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in its efforts to make users of its browser Firefox feel protected. Doing so has not only been for consumers’ benefit but a strategic move to differentiate the brand, and, in turn, has changed some of the company’s marketing tactics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roughly 18 months ago, Mozilla stopped advertising across all of Facebook’s businesses — from the namesake to Instagram to WhatsApp — because of the company’s data practices. That move transformed Mozilla’s marketing strategy. At the time, Mozilla had budgeted 80% of its dollars to digital marketing, but this year the company has decreased its digital spend, allocating 10% less to digital. The result: Mozilla has shifted more of its dollars to offline marketing efforts including events and content marketing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;piano-meter-offer&quot; readability=&quot;94.072954888841&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Facebook was one of our better-performing channels at the time that we made the decision,” said Mozilla CMO Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, adding that the decision has not negatively impacted the brand. “That being said, we’ve been able to maintain and improve the performance of the marketing programs at Mozilla without Facebook.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mozilla’s marketing budget is between $20 million and $100 million, said Kaykas-Wolff, adding that “it varies depending upon the different programs we’re running.” Per Kantar, which doesn’t track spending on social channels, Mozilla spent $8.2 million in 2018. The budget is split with 50% focused on North America and 50% focused on the rest of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mozilla’s pivot away from Facebook followed the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Now, the majority of the company’s digital spending goes to Google properties — Mozilla’s Firefox competes with Google’s Chrome — as a part of its digital acquisition strategy. According to Netshare, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/uk/what-firefoxs-anti-tracking-update-signals-about-wider-pivot-to-privacy-trend/&quot;&gt;previously reported by Digiday&lt;/a&gt;, Firefox’s market share is 9.3% of global monthly on desktop; meanwhile, Google Chrome’s is 66%. Aside from Cambridge Analytica, it’s unclear why Mozilla is fine with Google’s data practices but not Facebook’s as the company did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. The rest of the digital budget goes directly to publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In terms of events, Mozilla has been running an art exhibition-meets-pop-up store in cities like New York, London and Berlin meant to give attendees a physical experience of what happens to their data online. Inside the pop-up, Mozilla has a detox bar where consumers can learn how to help control the amount of data other companies have on them. Later this week, the exhibition, known as the Glass Room, will be held in the tech capital of the U.S.: San Francisco. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to content marketing, Mozilla is focusing its resources on developing podcasts in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S.,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://irlpodcast.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the company has IRL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which tells stories of life online, privacy and considers the future of the internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision to focus on data privacy in marketing the Mozilla brand came from research conducted by the company four years ago into the rise of consumers who make values-based decisions on not only what they purchase but where they spend their time. The company already had what it calls its “lean data” practices. That means the company doesn’t collect data on consumers that would surprise them and doesn’t collect data “unless [we] can deliver value as an organization with that data,” said Kaykas-Wolff.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article_description&quot; readability=&quot;32.393867924528&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;excerpt&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exclusive, inside look at what’s actually happening in the video industry, including original reporting, analysis of important stories and interviews with interesting executives and other newsmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of that push to collect as little data as possible on consumers, the company also employs that strategy in its marketing. Aside from moving off of Facebook, Mozilla doesn’t use practices like retargeting. “We never buy, sell or lease any of our customer data or buy any customer data outside of the data our customers submit to us,” said Kaykas-Wolff. “We don’t use programmatic spending; we’re not comfortable with the data-sharing practices.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mozilla did test programmatic but found the data practices of vendors at odds with its mission in terms of consumer data. The company has considered running programmatic internally, but the cost-benefit hasn’t worked out, according to Kaykas-Wolff. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company has an in-house media buyer, media planner and execution teams but still collaborates with a media agency, Fetch. Overall, the marketing department has roughly 100 people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By focusing its marketing efforts offline and moving away from Facebook, the company is able to inform consumers about data privacy issues while also pitching its brand to consumers who may be concerned about those issues. That approach could be beneficial to the company, according to Allen Adamson, brand consultant and co-founder of Metaforce. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“More consumers are starting to understand what a danger digital privacy is,” said Adamson. “While it’s a niche issue now, a growing segment of the market is aware of and concerned with keeping their data private. Facebook is the evil empire in that world, so saying, ‘I’m not going to advertise on Facebook’  [could help] the Firefox brand. Not choosing Facebook has become a positive badge, although it’s still a phenomenally important marketing tool.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google chief: I&amp;#039;d disclose smart speakers before guests enter my home</title>

                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Nest Hub Max&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12BC7/production/_109234767_6f214c2c-de1d-4c30-92e3-583b317eb589.jpg&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Google's range of camera and microphone-fitted devices include the Nest Hub Max
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;It's an admission that appears to have caught Google's devices chief by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being challenged as to whether homeowners should tell guests smart devices - such as a Google Nest speaker or Amazon Echo display - are in use before they enter the building, he concludes that the answer is indeed yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gosh, I haven't thought about this before in quite this way,&quot; Rick Osterloh begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's quite important for all these technologies to think about all users... we have to consider all stakeholders that might be in proximity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he commits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it's probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair to Google, it hasn't completely ignored matters of 21st Century privacy etiquette until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mr Osterloh points out, its Nest cameras shine an LED light when they are in record mode, which cannot be overridden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea of having to run around a home unplugging or at least restricting the capabilities of all its voice- and camera-equipped kit if a visitor objects is quite the ask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50042719&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Pixel 4 seeks to reclaim low-light photography crown for Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concession came at the end of one-on-one interview given to BBC News to mark the launch of Google's Pixel 4 smartphones, a new Nest smart speaker and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Mr Osterloh first worked at Google when he headed its Motorola division, until it was sold in 2014 - he returned to the technology giant in 2016
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation below has been edited for clarity and brevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new Pixel phones have two cameras on their rear for the first time. But is there a risk consumers say: &quot;The new iPhone and Galaxy S10 have three and some others have four. I'm just going to go with the ones that have more because two doesn't sound that great&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are very sophisticated now about their phone purchases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They study them. They'll read the reviews. You're going to live with them for two, three or four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people remember from just a couple of years ago, where all the OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] were touting things such as: &quot;We have eight cores in our device, so it's super-fast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then they realised the actual practical mechanics of that were almost none of them was used and it was actually just sort of a marketing specification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Google hopes to once again offer the best low-light photography of any smartphone
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my view is in this market, people don't fall for simple numbers anymore. They look for user experiences and Pixel certainly has a brand that's known for having an absolutely terrific camera experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pixel phone is one of most leaked smartphones. You even tweeted details about its built-in radar in advance. Others go to great lengths to try to keep details of their devices under wraps until launch day. Presumably you don't think that matters?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We definitely wanted to take a bit of a different approach in how we launch and reveal elements of the products. Several months ago, we started to disclose a little bit about how the product looked and some of the core technologies. We wanted to make sure people started to get excited about it and understood a little bit about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other leaks we really would prefer did not happen. And unfortunately that shows a little bit of our adolescence in that we have to make sure we're reducing the amount of unintentional information disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some level, we're at least happy people care and desire this information. But we do want to try to reduce leaks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's been controversy over facial-recognition tests carried out on the phone's behalf. To make sure it worked better with dark skin tones, there's been reports a contractor targeted homeless people offering them $5 (£4) but didn't properly explain what was going on. Can you address that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Google promoted the Pixel 4's ability to use face unlock with dark skin tones, in a teaser video
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was very important for us to make sure the face unlock system works for all different kinds of people, genders, races, et cetera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as a consequence, we wanted to make sure we were able to get a large number of data points that allowed us to perfect this model in a fair way. So, we went out and did a lot of research in this area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's come to our attention there may be some methods that were not approved, not how we would do business. So, we're investigating that. We would never find that acceptable. And so we've suspended any data collection until this is straightened out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just to be clear about what you think is unacceptable. Was it the targeting of homeless people? Was it not explaining exactly what people were testing? Or what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of those allegations would be different than what we would find acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But do you still plan to retain the data collected in this way for 18 months?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know that we've discussed the length of time that we're holding data. But there have been no changes to the programme with respect to data retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934804/google-pixel-4-face-scanning-data-collection&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Note: The Verge reported being briefed about the 18-month limit in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;].&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But some people are going to think if the data wasn't collected with proper consent, surely you should delete it and start again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all under investigation. So, I just want to be clear we do not know the full facts of what has happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if the investigation concludes people didn't know what they were consenting to, are you going to delete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best approach here would be to discuss it once we've actually looked into the facts and understood what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of concern about facial recognition. You're selling camera-enabled devices that sit in people's living rooms, bedrooms, and on their front doors that use the technology. Do you accept reports about what happened with the Pixel tests help undermine confidence in Google and other big technology companies' use of facial recognition data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The Pixel 4 is the first in the series to have two cameras on the rear
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a distinction between what's being used to train a model for face unlock and facial recognition. There are specific use cases for these different technologies and it's very important to examine each one and determine if they're being used in a way appropriate for local laws and regulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is definitely important around the world for what is societally acceptable to be clearly defined in collaboration between tech companies and governments. We want to take a very cautious and thoughtful approach to these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are very important to debate and discuss and then together we have to clarify exactly what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Amazon recently unveiled its rival Ring smart cameras many expected them to add facial recognition but it decided not to. Do you think we need politicians to act quickly to set standards because there's a growing crisis of confidence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be great for regulation to be clarified quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach we're taking is to try to keep all of this information on devices as much as possible and always keep it private and secure and encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's certainly a key responsibility to make sure the user's information is protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everyone would benefit from clarity of standards and regulation. It is a challenging space to navigate. And it's very important it's thoughtfully navigated.&lt;/p&gt;

                    A graphic symbol tells users where they need to press to provide a fingerprint
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A flaw that means any fingerprint can unlock a Galaxy S10 phone has been acknowledged by Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promised a software patch that would fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue was spotted by a British woman whose husband was able to unlock her phone with his thumbprint when it was stored in a cheap case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the S10 was launched, in March, Samsung described the fingerprint authentication system as &quot;revolutionary&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Air gap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scanner sends ultrasounds to detect 3D ridges of fingerprints in order to recognise users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung said it was &quot;aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's online-only KaKao Bank told customers to switch off the fingerprint-recognition option to log in to its services until the issue was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous reports suggested some screen protectors were incompatible with Samsung's reader because they left a small air gap that interfered with the scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Thumb print&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British couple who discovered the security issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10127908/samsung-galaxy-s10-screen-protector-ebay/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;told the Sun newspaper&lt;/a&gt; it was a &quot;real concern&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After buying a £2.70 gel screen protector on eBay, Lisa Neilson registered her right thumbprint and then found her left thumbprint, which was not registered, could also unlock the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then asked her husband to try and both his thumbs also unlocked it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the screen protector was added to another relative's phone, the same thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
