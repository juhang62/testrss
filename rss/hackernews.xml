<title>New Evidence of Age Bias in Hiring, and a Push to Fight It</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/business/economy/age-discrimination-jobs-hiring.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;MADISON, Ala. — Across the United States, mammoth corporations and family businesses share a complaint: a shortage of workers. As the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/business/economy/jobs-report-april.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fnelson-d.-schwartz&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;unemployment rate&lt;/a&gt; has tunneled its way to a half-century low, employers insist they must scramble to lure applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The shadow of age bias in hiring, though, is long. Tens of thousands of workers say that even with the right qualifications for a job, they are repeatedly turned away because they are over 50, or even 40, and considered too old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The problem is getting more scrutiny after revelations that hundreds of employers shut out middle-aged and older Americans in their &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/business/facebook-job-ads.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;recruiting on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn and other platforms. Those disclosures are supercharging a wave of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But as cases make their way to court, the legal road for proving age discrimination, always difficult, has only roughened. Recent decisions by federal appeals courts in Chicago and Atlanta have limited the reach of anti-discrimination protections and made it even harder for job applicants to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is complicating an already challenging juncture of life. Workers over 50 — about 54 million Americans — are now facing much more precarious financial circumstances, a legacy of the recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More than half of workers over 50 lose longtime jobs before they are ready to retire, according to a recent &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/older-workers-united-states-pushed-out-of-work-forced-retirement&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the Urban Institute and ProPublica. Of those, nine out of 10 never recover their previous earning power. Some are able to find only piecemeal or gig work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If you lose your job at an older age, it’s really hard to get a new one,” said Richard Johnson, an Urban Institute economist who worked on the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-41aaca9b&quot;&gt;‘The Look in Their Eyes’&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tom Adair dressed in a sharply pressed white shirt and a blue blazer with gold buttons for the weekly meeting for ExperiencePlus, a group for job seekers over 50 held in the small library at St. John the Baptist Church in Madison, Ala., near Huntsville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A former quality manager at Toyota and an Air Force consultant, Mr. Adair said he has had temporary consulting assignments over the last decade but has not been able to get a steady full-time job since the recession’s nadir in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I ace the phone interviews,” Mr. Adair said. “They say: ‘Your résumé speaks volumes. You could hit the ground running. It looks like you’re the perfect fit.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“But you come in, and you’re D.O.A.,” said Mr. Adair, who is 71 and has neatly clipped gray hair. “You can see the look in their eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“My wife says: ‘We need to get you a face-lift. We need to get your hair dyed,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2017/beyond-bls/is-there-age-discrimination-in-hiring.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Older workers&lt;/a&gt; are much more likely to wrestle with prolonged joblessness than younger ones, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On average, a 54-year-old job hunter will be unemployed for nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Repeated inquiries can go unanswered, like space probes lost in a distant galaxy. In one of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2017/february/age-discrimination-and-hiring-older-workers/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most comprehensive studies&lt;/a&gt;, résumés were sent out on behalf of more than 40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages for thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, administrative assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 cities. In general, the older they were, the fewer callbacks they got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those in their 60s “never do better, and often do worse,” than those a decade or two younger, said David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, who oversaw the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is toughest for women, who suffer more age discrimination than men starting in their 40s, the researchers found. “The evidence of age discrimination against women kind of pops out in every study,” Mr. Neumark said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As for Mr. Adair, he said he had been through the same job-application routine so many times that it felt like “Groundhog Day.” Over the years, he consulted three lawyers about age discrimination. Each time, they advised that an individual lawsuit would not be worth the legal costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Adair’s notes from a session for job hunters. “It’s devastating,” Mr. Adair, a former Toyota quality manager, said of his repeated rejections. “You go through the stages just like dying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrea Morales for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With a small pension and Social Security, he said, he and his wife are “just getting by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s devastating,” Mr. Adair said. “You go through the stages just like dying. First you can’t believe it. You’re so sure and your wife is so sure, and even the recruiter is. Then you get mad.” By the end, you feel like giving up, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-34e0ca5&quot;&gt;Wanted: Greener Employees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hiring complaints and lawsuits are rarely filed because they are difficult to prove and the cost is high, said Robert E. Weisberg, a regional attorney with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To bring a case against Seasons 52, a national restaurant chain, Mr. Weisberg said, the commission looked to establish a pattern of bias over a period of years by combining statistical analyses with testimony from applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agency examined whether the chain could have hired so few applicants 40 or older if there had been no age discrimination, and calculated the odds at less than one in 10,000, according to court documents. The commission also collected affidavits from 139 applicants at 35 restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;George Simmons was 45 when he applied at a Seasons 52 in Lone Tree, Colo., in 2014. “My interview was going well until the interviewer asked me my age,” he stated. After he answered, he said, he was shown the door. “I asked what was the problem,” he said, “and the interviewer responded that the restaurant was looking for younger people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Heidi Barsaloux was 44 when she applied for a bartender position at a Seasons 52 in Schaumburg, Ill., in 2010. “An interviewer told me that they were not looking for people with that much experience and wanted people who were more green,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A third applicant was told, “We are not looking for old white guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the chain, part of Darden Restaurants, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/5-3-18a.cfm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; last year to pay $2.85 million and hire a monitor to prevent discrimination against applicants over 40. As part of the settlement, the chain denied any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There have been other legal offensives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/class-action-lawsuit-hits-tmobile-amazon-cox-for-alleged-age-discrimination&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Communications Workers of America&lt;/a&gt; has filed a lawsuit on behalf of millions of older Americans against Amazon, T-Mobile and Cox Communications, accusing them and hundreds of other major employers of systematic age discrimination in hiring based on targeted online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The union and several workers have also filed complaints with the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; against more than 70 employers and employment agencies related to age discrimination in recruiting. It expects that some of those will turn into class-action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By exposing so much of the help-wanted process on the internet, “the transformation to digital recruiting has shined a spotlight on how discrimination happens, and it’s made it much easier to do so,” said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten &amp;amp; Golden working with the union. “We’re going to start going after these companies, one by one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And in a broad &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/facebook-discrimination-ads.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; with civil rights groups and the union, Facebook agreed to eliminate the ability of advertisers to screen out minority groups, women or older job seekers from seeing particular help-wanted listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Facebook has agreed not to let advertisers screen out minority groups, women or older job seekers from seeing particular job listings. In one example of the practice, users who clicked on “Why am I seeing this ad?” were told it was aimed at men 18 to 50 who live in or were recently near Fort Worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We want the E.E.O.C. to declare that this type of exclusionary advertising is unlawful” on any online platform, Mr. Romer-Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said the company had taken steps to combat hiring discrimination and was exploring what more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-697cea5&quot;&gt;A Cap on Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dale E. Kleber had been out of work for three years when he saw a posting in 2014 for a legal position at CareFusion, a medical technology company. At 58, with three of his four children living at home, in a suburb of Chicago, he was feeling the financial strain of prolonged unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So even though the ad specified that applicants should have no more than seven years of experience, Mr. Kleber applied. CareFusion ended up hiring a 29-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Kleber, a veteran lawyer and former general counsel of a national dairy and food company, sued, arguing that a limit on experience effectively ruled out older applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Litigation is a terrible way to settle disputes,” said Mr. Kleber, who during his career had defended companies against complaints filed with the E.E.O.C. “It’s a very uncertain process, it is fraught with risk, and sometimes it comes out wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Putting a cap on experience, though, “just seemed so egregious,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit did not agree. In a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chamberlitigation.com/sites/default/files/cases/files/19191919/Kleber%20v.%20CareFusion%20%28CA7%20en%20banc%29.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; this year supporting CareFusion, it stated that recruiting practices that have the effect of screening out older applicants — what is known in legal terms as having a “disparate impact” — did not violate the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The decision mirrored &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/supreme-court-rj-reynolds-age-discrimination-case&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one involving R. J. Reynolds Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; made earlier by the Court of Appeals for 11th Circuit in Atlanta, which the Supreme Court declined to review. It ruled that unlike employees already on the payroll who can show that a policy has a negative impact on a group regardless of the motivation, applicants would have to prove intentional discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for Becton Dickinson and Company, which owns CareFusion, said, “We are deeply committed to providing equal employment opportunities and a workplace free from discrimination, and as such we are pleased with the decision from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In April, Mr. Kleber and the AARP Foundation asked the United States Supreme Court to review the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It defies common sense,” Mr. Kleber said, to think Congress “intended to offer greater legal protections to people who have jobs than people looking for jobs” when it passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other older workers and advocates elsewhere are making the same argument, pushing for a broader interpretation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a federal court in California, a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.outtengolden.com/class-action/pricewaterhousecoopers-age-discrimination&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the global accounting firm PwC that claims “substantial evidence of age disparities in hiring” was certified in April. The company noted on its career website and in reports that the average age of its 220,000-member work force was 27, and that 80 percent of the staff members were millennials (born after 1981).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;PwC responded that the company’s “hiring practices are merit-based and have nothing to do with age.” It added, “The plaintiffs’ accusations are false, and we will prove that in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e5e2aa94c1f97b91c8754da0f2f9700602122339/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4950624c6448792e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e5e2aa94c1f97b91c8754da0f2f9700602122339/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4950624c6448792e676966&quot; alt=&quot;onefraction.gif&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IPbLdHy.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneFraction was supposed to be a platform that gave users rewards for paying their rent through the platform as opposed to check or bank transfer. The value would come from leveraging data to eventually create a rental marketplace where users can find the perfect apartment to move into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built using &lt;code&gt;react-native-web&lt;/code&gt; because its really cool and really easy to turn into a mobile app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in Node.js. The server uses GraphQL with &lt;code&gt;apollo-server&lt;/code&gt; for delivering data between client and server and &lt;code&gt;typegoose&lt;/code&gt; for interacting with Mongo in a nice type-friendly way. Accounts are set up using the wonderful &lt;code&gt;accounts.js&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;type-graphql&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;graphql-codegen&lt;/code&gt; are used to generate types for all my graphql resolvers to keep client and server totally and beautifully in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other cool things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've included a number of animations using plain css and &lt;code&gt;react-spring&lt;/code&gt;. If you're a react developer and want to animate your work learn &lt;code&gt;react-spring&lt;/code&gt;. Thank me later. This project is using Plaid to access read info for users bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Zanzibar: Consistent, Global Authorization System</title>
<link>https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48190</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48190</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining whether online users are authorized to access digital objects is central to preserving privacy. This paper presents the design, implementation, and deployment of Zanzibar, a global system for storing and evaluating access control lists. Zanzibar provides a uniform data model and configuration language for expressing a wide range of access control policies from hundreds of client services at Google, including Calendar, Cloud, Drive, Maps, Photos, and YouTube. Its authorization decisions respect causal ordering of user actions and thus provide external consistency amid changes to access control lists and object contents. Zanzibar scales to trillions of access control lists and millions of authorization requests per second to support services used by billions of people. It has maintained 95th-percentile latency of less than 10 milliseconds and availability of greater than 99.999% over 3 years of production use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WeChat and the Surveillance State</title>
<link>https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-48552907</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-48552907</guid>
<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;WeChat notification&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D794/production/_107288155_image2-2.png&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;China's WeChat is a site for social interaction, a form of currency, a dating app, a tool for sporting teams and deliverer of news: Twitter, Facebook, Googlemaps, Tinder and Apple Pay all rolled into one. But it is also an ever more powerful weapon of social control for the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just been locked out of WeChat (or Weixin 微信 as it is known in Chinese) and, to get back on, have had to pass through some pretty Orwellian steps - steps which have led others to question why I went along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason is that life in Beijing would be extremely difficult without WeChat. The other is that I could not have written this piece without experiencing the stages which have now clearly put my image, and even my voice, on some sort of biometric database of troublemakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in Hong Kong to cover the enormous candlelight vigil marking 30 years since the People's Liberation Army was ordered to open fire on its own people to remove the mostly student protesters who'd been gathering in and around Tiananmen Square for months in June 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48365624&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Taiwanese 'Tank Man' marks Tiananmen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47987817&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Leica Tiananmen video angers China &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment in history has been all but erased from public discourse on mainland China but in Hong Kong, with its special status in the Chinese-speaking world, people turn out every year to remember the bloody crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time round the crowd was particularly huge, with estimates ranging up to 180,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally I took photos of the sea of people holding candles and singing, and posted some of these on my WeChat &quot;moments&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p07bxgvc.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media playback is unsupported on your device&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Tiananmen's tank man: The image that China forgot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post contained no words - just photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese friends started asking on WeChat what the event was? Why were people gathering? Where was it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That such questions were coming from young professionals here shows the extent to which knowledge of Tiananmen 1989 has been made to disappear in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I answered a few of them, rather cryptically, then suddenly I was locked out of WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your login has been declined due to account exceptions. Try to log in again and proceed as instructed,&quot; came the message on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when I tried to log back in, a new message appeared: &quot;This WeChat account has been suspected of spreading malicious rumours and has been temporarily blocked…&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems posting photos of an actual event taking place, without commentary, amounts to &quot;spreading malicious rumours&quot; in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was given time to try and log in again the next day after my penalty had been served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I did I had to push &quot;agree and unblock&quot; under the stated reason of &quot;spread malicious rumours&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this rumour-monger clicked on &quot;agree&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came a stage I was not prepared for. &quot;Faceprint is required for security purposes,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was instructed to hold my phone up - to &quot;face front camera straight on&quot; - looking directly at the image of a human head. Then told to &quot;Read numbers aloud in Mandarin Chinese&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My voice was captured by the App at the same time it scanned my face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards a big green tick: &quot;Approved&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from being creepy you can only imagine the potential use of this type of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt I have now joined some list of suspicious individuals in the hands of goodness knows which Chinese government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China pretty much everyone has WeChat. I don't know a single person without it. Developed by tech giant Tencent it is an incredible app. It's convenient. It works. It's fun. It was ahead of the game on the global stage and it has found its way into all corners of people's existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could deliver to the Communist Party a life map of pretty much everybody in this country, citizens and foreigners alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capturing the face and voice image of everyone who was suspended for mentioning the Tiananmen crackdown anniversary in recent days would be considered very useful for those who want to monitor anyone who might potentially cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I placed details of this entire process on Twitter others were asking: why cave in to such a Big Brother intrusion on your privacy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They've probably not lived in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a life here without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43283690&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Are you one of the WeChat billion?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-47554676&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Students graded on number of 'friends'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you meet somebody in a work context they don't given you a name card any more, they share their WeChat; if you play for a football team training details are on WeChat; children's school arrangements, WeChat; Tinder-style dates, WeChat; movie tickets, WeChat; news stream, WeChat; restaurant locations, WeChat; paying for absolutely everything from a bowl of noodles to clothes to a dining room table… WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wouldn't be able to speak to their friends or family without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the censors who can lock you out of Wechat hold real power over you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app - thought by Western intelligence agencies to be the least secure of its type in the world - has essentially got you over a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a normal life in China, you had better not say anything controversial about the Communist Party and especially not about its leader, Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is China 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;dir-ltr&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;12.169934640523&quot;&gt;Okay, listen up. This is not a drill. Ivan Golunov, my colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/meduzaproject&quot; class=&quot;twitter-atreply dir-ltr&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-mentioned-user-id=&quot;2803786405&quot; data-screenname=&quot;meduzaproject&quot;&gt;@meduzaproject&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best investigative reporters in the industry, was arrested yesterday after leaving work (I was with him before he left).

<title>Maker Faire halts operations and lays off all staff</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/make-magazine-maker-media-layoffs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/make-magazine-maker-media-layoffs/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Financial troubles have forced &lt;a href=&quot;https://makermedia.com/&quot;&gt;Maker Media&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind crafting publication &lt;a href=&quot;https://makezine.com/&quot;&gt;MAKE:&lt;/a&gt; magazine as well as the science and art festival &lt;a href=&quot;https://makerfaire.com/&quot;&gt;Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, to lay off its entire staff of 22 and pause all operations. TechCrunch was tipped off to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/make-inc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;make-inc&quot;&gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt; Media’s unfortunate situation which was then confirmed by the company’s founder and CEO Dale Dougherty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, MAKE: guided adults and children through step-by-step do-it-yourself crafting and science projects, and it was central to the maker movement. Since 2006, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/maker-faire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;maker-faire&quot;&gt;Maker Faire’s&lt;/a&gt; 200 owned and licensed events per year in over 40 countries let attendees wander amidst giant, inspiring art and engineering installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1839166&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ACF49D9B-3985-4812-94A2-6BD32FFE46A4.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/maker-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;maker-media&quot;&gt;Maker Media&lt;/a&gt; Inc ceased operations this week and let go of all of its employees — about 22 employees” Dougherty tells TechCrunch. “I started this 15 years ago and it’s always been a struggle as&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; a &lt;/span&gt;business to make this work. Print publishing is not a great business for anybody, but it works…barely. Events are hard . . . there was a drop off in corporate sponsorship.” Microsoft and Autodesk failed to sponsor this year’s flagship Bay Area Maker Faire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dougherty is still desperately trying to resuscitate the company in some capacity, if only to keep MAKE:’s online archive running and continue allowing third-party organizers to license the Maker Faire name to throw affiliated events. Rather than bankruptcy, Maker Media is working through an alternative Assignment for Benefit of Creditors process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to keep the servers running” Dougherty tells me. “I hope to be able to get control of the assets of the company and restart it. We’re not necessarily going to do everything we did in the past but I’m committed to keeping the print magazine going and the Maker Faire licensing program.” The fate of those hopes will depend on negotiations with banks and financiers over the next few weeks. For now the sites remain online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO says staffers understood the challenges facing the company following &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/burn-slower-or-vaporize/&quot;&gt;layoffs in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and then at least 8 more employees being let go in March according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Next-week-s-Maker-Faire-in-San-Mateo-could-be-13836040.php&quot;&gt;SF Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve been paid their owed wages and PTO, but did not receive any severance or two-week notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;“It started as a venture-backed company but we realized it wasn’t a venture-backed opportunity” Dougherty admits, as his company had raised $10 million from Obvious Ventures, Raine Ventures, and Floodgate. “The company wasn’t that interesting to its investors anymore. It was failing as a business but not as a mission.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Should it be a non-profit or something like that? Some of our best successes for instance are in education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is especially sad because the public was still enthusiastic about Maker Media’s products  Dougherty said that despite rain, Maker Faire’s big Bay Area event last week met its ticket sales target. 1.45 million people attended its events in 2016. MAKE: magazine had 125,000 paid subscribers and the company had racked up over one million YouTube subscribers. But high production costs in expensive cities and a proliferation of free DIY project content online had strained Maker Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It works for people but it doesn’t necessarily work as a business today, at least under my oversight” Dougherty concluded. For now the company is stuck in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the outcome of revival efforts, Maker Media has helped inspire a generation of engineers and artists, brought families together around crafting, and given shape to a culture of tinkerers. The memory of its events and weekends spent building will live on as inspiration for tomorrow’s inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about eight months after Barnes &amp;amp; Noble revealed it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/barnes--noble-announces-strategic-review-stock-jumps-more-than-17percent.html&quot;&gt;exploring a possible sale&lt;/a&gt;, the embattled bookseller has settled on a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mega-chain, which boasts 627 locations across the U.S., announced Friday that the Elliott Management Corp. has agreed to buy Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for about $683 million — a price tag that includes the bookseller's debt, which Elliott will take on as part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move marks Elliott's second major splash in the world of books in the span of a year. Last June the New York-based hedge fund acquired Waterstones, which, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterstones.com/help/about-us/44&quot;&gt;with more than 280 bookshops&lt;/a&gt;, is the largest retail bookseller in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Elliott is set to own the largest bookseller in the U.S., too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Elliott, the owner of Waterstones, a bookseller I have admired over the years,&quot; Leonard Riggio, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/about-bn/heritage/&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's modern iteration&lt;/a&gt; and still its chairman, said in a statement released Friday. &quot;In view of the success they have had in the bookselling marketplace, I believe they are uniquely suited to improve and grow our company for many years ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott was careful to note that &quot;each bookseller will operate independently&quot; — but added that &quot;they will share a common CEO and benefit from the sharing of best practice between the companies.&quot; That CEO is James Daunt, the British-born chief of Waterstones, who plans to head up both companies from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Physical bookstores the world over face fearsome challenges from online and digital,&quot; Daunt said Friday. &quot;We meet these with investment and with all the more confidence for being able to draw on the unrivaled bookselling skills of these two great companies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's not kidding about those &quot;fearsome challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the towering Goliath of the bookselling world, these days Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is getting dwarfed by primarily online competitors — particularly Amazon, which reportedly sells &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/this-holiday-season-could-seal-barnes--nobles-fate.html&quot;&gt;nearly 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all new books. The bricks-and-mortar giant, on the other hand, has seen its revenue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BKS/barnes-noble/revenue&quot;&gt;slide each year&lt;/a&gt; for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daunt has been credited with helping turn the fortunes of Waterstones, which less than a decade ago was &quot;losing horrendous amounts of money,&quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/waterstones-annual-profits-jump-80-percent-books-sale&quot;&gt;words of its CEO&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, the British bookseller has been reporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/01/waterstones-first-year-of-profit-since-2008-financial-crash-bookseller-amazon-rise-sales&quot;&gt;leaps in profits&lt;/a&gt;. The financial backing of Elliott, which says it currently manages approximately $34 billion in assets, shouldn't hurt Barnes &amp;amp; Noble either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bookseller expects the deal to close by the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open Source Electronics Lab for $30</title>
<link>https://github.com/EspoTek/Labrador</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/EspoTek/Labrador</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EspoTek Labrador is an open-source board that converts your PC, Raspberry Pi or Android Smartphone and into a full-featured electronics lab bench, complete with oscilloscope, signal generator and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://espotek.com/labrador&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://espotek.com/labrador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repo hosts all of the software and hardware that makes Labrador possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download binary (executable) versions of the software, go to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/releases&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is re-built automatically each time I make a change to the source code. I recommend always downloading the latest win32, osx-dmg or linux-appimage version, depending on whether you're on Windows, macOS or Linux. Raspberry Pi downloads are not currently automatically built, but an older version is provided at the link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the documentation, please visit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/wiki&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All software files are licenced under GNU GPL v3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hardware files (schematics, PCB) are licenced under Creative Commons 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA). &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Qt Creator to build the software interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Desktop_Interface/Labrador.pro, then Clean All -&amp;gt; Run qmake -&amp;gt; Build All.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're on Linux (including Raspberry Pi), then you can also build the software from source by cloning the repo, cd'ing to the Desktop_Interface directory then running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;qmake
make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to launch, just type &lt;code&gt;labrador&lt;/code&gt; into the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build the AVR software, I use Atmel Studio 7. Just load up the .atsln and push F7. You can use &lt;code&gt;avr-gcc&lt;/code&gt; if you don't want to install a full IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB files can be edited in KiCAD 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the main bugs from the pre-launch period have now been fixed, including synchronisation issues.&lt;br/&gt;Please open an issue if you're aware of any in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make any suggestions, or better yet, submit some code, please do so here at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions and feature requests belong on the &quot;Issues&quot; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For code submissions, look into Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want to say hello and remind me that people are actually using my product (or if you just don't want to make a GitHub account), please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:admin@espotek.com&quot;&gt;admin@espotek.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all.&lt;br/&gt;~Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
