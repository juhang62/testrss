<title>DeleteFB: Selenium script to delete all of your Facebook wall posts</title>
<link>https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a simple and reliable way to delete Facebook posts. There are third-party apps that claim to do this, but they all require handing over your credentials, or are unreliable in other ways. Since this uses Selenium, it is more reliable, as it uses your real web browser, and it is less likely Facebook will block or throttle you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why you would want to do this in the first place. That is up to you. Personally I wanted a way to delete most of my content on Facebook without deleting my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; delete posts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make no guarantees that Facebook doesn't store the data somewhere forever in cold storage. However this tool is intended more as a way to clean up your online presence and not have to worry about what you wrote from years ago. Personally, I did this so I would feel less attached to my Facebook profile (and hence feel the need to use it less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and that it is up to date, as well as the chromedriver for Selenium. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. On Arch Linux you can find this in the &lt;code&gt;chromium&lt;/code&gt; package, but it will vary by OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip3 install --user delete-facebook-posts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;deletefb -E &quot;youremail@example.org&quot; -P &quot;yourfacebookpassword&quot; -U &quot;https://www.facebook.com/your.profile.url&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script will log into your Facebook account, go to your profile page, and start deleting posts. If it cannot delete something, then it will &quot;hide&quot; it from your timeline instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient as it will take a very long time, but it will eventually clear everything. You may safely minimize the chrome window without breaking it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Install Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on installing with Brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your native package manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, but I make no guarantees that Selenium will actually work as I have not tested it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it stops working or otherwise crashes, delete the latest post manually and start it again after waiting a minute. I make no guarantees that it will work perfectly for every profile. Please file an issue if you run into any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c-lead-image__attribution&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Madison McVeigh/CityLab&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;It’s time to end the tyranny of open-concept interior design.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If someone asked me five years ago whether or not I thought the open floor plan would still be popular, I would have said no. Domestic architecture seemed to be taking a turn toward the rustic. Today, “Farmhouse” and “Craftsman” modern designs, harkening back to the American vernacular tradition (complete with shiplap walls), are a tour-de-force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But I would have been wrong. Although these houses bring all the exterior trappings of beloved vernacular houses of the past, they do not extend that to the interior plans. In fact, the open concepts from the oversized houses of the pre-recession era have only gotten &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Much has been written about the open floor plan: how it came to be, why it is bad (or good), whether it should or shouldn’t be applied to existing housing. The open floor plan as we currently understand it—an entry-kitchen-dining-living combination that avoids any kind of structural separation between uses—is only a few decades old. Prior to the last 25 years, an “open floor plan” meant a living configuration without &lt;em&gt;doors&lt;/em&gt;; now the term has come to mean a living configuration without &lt;em&gt;walls&lt;/em&gt;. I will refer to the latter from now on as an “open concept,” in order to differentiate it from a traditional open floor plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/AP_051007018677/01f7b92fc.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;An open-concept house in Massachusetts in 2005. (Michael Dwyer/AP)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot; readability=&quot;57.951219512195&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interior-wall-free open concept became popular starting in the 1970s, evolving from the cedar contemporary homes known for their tall ceilings and windows, and from &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=fjbaCwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA695&amp;amp;lpg=PA695&amp;amp;dq=%22styled+ranch%22+house&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=cD9mPadV7W&amp;amp;sig=BvSRH7FP6ztIGADg6-lI91CsPfE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI4IWkmNbbAhWMqlMKHWjEDjEQ6AEIZzAM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22styled%20ranch%22%20house&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;styled ranches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; whose steeper rooflines allowed for newly in-vogue cathedral ceilings. Overall, the open concept was a reaction against years of small, low-ceilinged living, which felt restricting and stuffy to a new generation of homebuyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;69.560580204778&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/05/the-curse-of-an-open-floor-plan/560561/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Ian Bogost described a new luxury concept called the “mess kitchen”—a second kitchen out of sight from the main kitchen and the rest of the open plan. He cited it to demonstrate why the open floor plan and its rhetoric around “entertaining” have reached new levels of absurdity. However, to me, the mess kitchen offers hope for a transitional period where open spaces may become closed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;That this would start with the kitchen is not surprising. Historically, the kitchen was the last room to be integrated into the open concept. Living and dining rooms began to converge as early as the beginning of the 1900s, when changes in architectural taste and the development of mass-industrialized housing production favored a more compact home design than the rambling, formal “hall-and-parlor” layout of Victorian times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional narrative is that, historically, houses had floor plans that were closed, and then they began opening up. But it is important to understand that this argument centers on the homes of the affluent classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/GettyImages_534248364/db3019d8e.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Meeting of aristocratic families in the living room.

&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wealthy families in the 18th and 19th centuries had homes with several rooms for specific purposes, such as parlors, libraries, drawing rooms, smoking rooms, and servants’ quarters. Then, new building materials and construction technologies led to shifts in architectural taste that favored more continuous interior spaces: First came the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts movement, then Modernism. Social changes that arose with modern industrial capitalism, such as the transition away from live-in servants to commuting wage-workers, also reduced the number of rooms in upper-class houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;98.647887323944&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, in the homes of the working and lower-middle classes, these same factors of social change and modernization created an opposite progression. The story of common houses is a story of walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The number of rooms in working-class homes increased with the number of products and amenities that became readily affordable through industrialization, modernization, and mass production. The common house, as well as working-class living environments such as dwelling houses and tenements, only had one to three rooms: a kitchen space and a living and/or sleeping space, which were multipurpose, used for working as well as living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Beginning in the 1860s, work increasingly took place outside of the home, and the application of mass production to housing reduced building costs. During this period, the average number of rooms increased, to three to five: a kitchen, a living room, and one or two bedrooms. Common vernacular examples of this period (1860-1900) include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://moss-design.com/worker-cottage/&quot;&gt;worker’s cottage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_house&quot;&gt;the shotgun house&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upright_and_Wing&quot;&gt;Temple-and-Wing&lt;/a&gt; house, and early examples of the four-box and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antiquehomestyle.com/styles/foursquare.htm&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;. In these early industrial-era homes, the threshold between working-class and middle-class was determined by amenities like a dining room or a front porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the 1900s and 1910s, mass single-family housing shipped to the site by rail and truck had come into its own. Now sizes and types of wood, nails, and other construction materials had become widely standardized across the building industry. During the second half of the 19th century, a key development—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldhouseweb.com/how-to-advice/balloon-framing.shtml&quot;&gt;balloon framing&lt;/a&gt;—allowed for more inexpensive construction, since the cheap materials (nails, studs, and 2x4s) were readily available and did not required skilled labor to assemble, unlike timber framing. Long, lightweight studs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finehomebuilding.com/1998/03/01/the-process-of-balloon-framing&quot;&gt;the clever, basket-like technique&lt;/a&gt; of assembly enabled taller and longer homes to be built by as few as two people and with relatively little waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Two of the most common and recognizable types of vernacular American housing—the bungalow and the Foursquare—became massively popular during this time. The average number of rooms per house increased once again. Working-class homes now had three to five rooms; middle-class homes, six to eight. Whether or not a home was determined to be working- or middle-class depended on whether it had indoor plumbing (bathrooms!) or electricity, both of which had become increasingly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/377720pu/a0dc9e675.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Duplex bungalow built c. 1905 for cigar-factory workers in Tampa’s Ybor City. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-6&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Architectural historians place a great deal of emphasis on the bungalow, often citing it as the beginning of the “open” floor plan, since many bungalows omitted the closed wall between the living and dining areas. However, these historians focus on high-style Arts &amp;amp; Crafts bungalows, which featured more inventive architecture, and ignore the fact that in working-and-middle class bungalows, the average number of individual (closed) rooms increased as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Only in more elaborate middle-class bungalows is the wall between the living and dining room separated by a partial wall or colonnade. This feature was more expensive to construct, because it required structural loads to be redistributed to other walls or fixtures. Structural reasons in general were why, in common houses, open spaces would not become more widespread until changes in construction made them more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even as plans in elite houses continued to open up throughout the 1920s, the common house retained its interior walls. Why? In many respects, closed rooms existed to maintain a semblance of privacy. Homes were smaller, but families were bigger than they are now: The average number of people in an American household was five in 1880 and 4.3 in 1920; today, it’s 2.5. The reason why the first door to be omitted was frequently that between the living and dining rooms was because those rooms were considered “public” spaces, a holdover from the hall-and-parlor Victorian times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/3c29768u/874b12096.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Homes in Greenbelt, Maryland—a town built by the federal government for lower-income families in the 1930s—had separate kitchens, dining rooms, and living rooms, and many had three bedrooms, a luxury at the time. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;80.003745318352&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Work areas, such as the kitchen, and private spaces, like bedrooms and bathrooms, were always closed off to avoid guests seeing the mess of meal-making or, heaven forbid, the “unmentionable room” (the bathroom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the end of the 1920s, the large, old-growth trees that produced the long studs central to the technique of balloon framing became scarce, leading to new techniques that could be completed with smaller spans of wood. Today’s style of framing, platform framing,  enabled more flexible room shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The small &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcmansionhell.com/post/162212185966/looking-around-the-curious-case-of-minimal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal traditional houses&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s through early ‘50s employed this new framing technique on a mass, federally-subsidized scale. These small homes relied on interior walls to ensure spatial privacy (not to mention aural, olfactory, and visual privacy) in cramped situations. The closed floor plan also represented security, isolation, and control, concepts that were important in a moment that emerged from the Depression and then World War II, and deepened through a period of intense racial tension and Cold War paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-9&quot; readability=&quot;62&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The ranch and the split-level, both of which originated in the mid-1940s, drastically changed patterns of dwelling in the American home. This is often cited as the spark that lit the fire of the open concept. The reorientation of the ideal American home, from vertical, two-story Cape Cod to horizontal, one-story ranch, certainly did open up floor plans. By this point, a continuous living and dining space was commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/32700u/c260f118c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;The innovative 1948 Revere Quality House in Sarasota, Florida, designed by Ralph Twitchell and Paul Rudolph, had an L-shaped combination living/dining space; the kitchen was separated from the dining area by a partition. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-10&quot; readability=&quot;86&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, one room remained stubbornly closed for at least another decade: the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kitchens have been closed for most of the history of common housing. In elite houses, kitchens were places of work, where servants were kept out of sight of residents and guests, often relegated to the cellar or guesthouse. This functional separation was continued in middle-class houses, even as live-in servants became a feature of the past. Most kitchens are placed in the rear of the house. Access to a rear kitchen door allowed for faster disposal of waste and easy ventilation; also, deliveries could be made directly to the kitchen to save labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kitchens began to open up and become public spaces in the home because of cultural shifts regarding consumption. Domestic theorist Christine Frederick’s term “creative waste” sums up this new mentality: It was the moral obligation of the 1920s housewife to buy and discard products, one that elevated the concept of waste as being positive, indulgent, and stimulating to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This attitude merged with new technological advances. When inventions such as central air conditioning and improved fire suppression became commonplace, the kitchen, no longer a place of shame and no longer reliant upon the ventilation provided by the kitchen door, began to shift to different parts of the home. The attached garage often replaced the backyard as the common point of entry into the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Room layout, which more often than not had its roots in social and practical constraints, became liberated due to these new cultures of consumption and technologies of comfort. Without these developments, the open concept would have never been possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-11&quot; readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If closed floor plans are considered such a nuisance these days, why did they prevail for almost 100 years in single-family working- and middle-class suburban housing? The answer: closed floor plans make a lot of sense, from both an environmental and a living perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/GettyImages_517423330/e8bc51601.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;A 1950s model kitchen, with sink and stove a few steps apart. (Bettmann/Getty Images)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-12&quot; readability=&quot;97&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are going to need to consume a lot less energy if we want to stem the tide of global climate change. The good news is, humans survived for thousands of years without air conditioning and cars, and thus can learn some lessons from the past. The closed floor plan, especially the closed kitchen, can help save energy by the simple principle of not heating and cooling rooms that are not currently in use, as well as by isolating rooms we want to keep warm or cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As cultures of consumption change and people become more environmentally conscious, homes must change to reflect this. Designing homes around “entertaining” that happens only a handful of times a year is a wasteful, yet still mindbogglingly popular practice. When people come to visit, they are there to see you, not your open concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It may not be as glamorous, but the closed kitchen is actually more efficient for cooking than the sprawling, open “chef’s kitchens” that are so popular. It enables whoever does the cooking to take fewer steps to perform tasks. The chef’s kitchen follows the wasteful logic of the 1920s: Instead of moving the sink closer to the stove, builders install a pot filler or a second sink in a center island. Instead of closing in the main kitchen to isolate the disorder of food preparation, developers are building “mess kitchens” for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The “labor-saving” elements of open floor plans are in some ways labor-creating. A large, single, continuous space is harder to get and keep clean. Messes and smells are no longer isolated, but can be easily tracked throughout the entire first floor of a large home. Less house in general means less house to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Not separating cooking, living, and dining is also an acoustical nightmare, especially in today’s style of interior design, which avoids carpet, curtains, and other soft goods that absorb sound. This is especially true of homes that do not have separate formal living and dining spaces but one single continuous space. Nothing is more maddening than trying to read or watch television in the tall-ceilinged living room with someone banging pots and pans or using the food processor 10 feet away in the open kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-13&quot; readability=&quot;64.098613251156&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The best thing about the closed floor plan? It offers what it has always offered: aural, olfactory, and spatial privacy. Humans have always needed the sense of comfort and refuge that defined rooms provide. That may explain the rise of “man caves” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwell.com/article/she-sheds-design-a4fa8409&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;she sheds&lt;/a&gt;”—closed spaces that rebel against the open concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Instead of these—space-wasting, specialized rooms that are used relatively sparingly—why not just build common rooms with walls and doors? If you want to escape something unpleasant, you can do so without feeling banished or isolating yourself from everyone else. Sometimes, true freedom means putting up a few barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uber operates on a global scale across more than 600 cities, with our apps relying entirely on wireless connectivity from over 4,500 mobile carriers. To deliver the real-time performance expected from Uber’s users, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication. Unfortunately, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;stack fares poorly in dynamic, lossy wireless networks, and we learned that poor performance can often be traced directly to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implementations buried in OS kernels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To address these pain points, we adopted the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a stream-multiplexed modern transport protocol implemented over UDP, which enables us to better control the transport protocol performance. QUIC is currently being standardized by the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(IETF) as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quicwg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After thorough testing of QUIC, we concluded that integrating QUIC in our apps would reduce the tail-end latencies compared to TCP. We witnessed a reduction of 10-30 percent in tail-end latencies for HTTPS traffic at scale in our rider and driver apps. In addition to improving the performance of our apps in low connectivity networks, QUIC gives us end-to-end control over the flow of packets in the user space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this article, we share our experiences optimizing TCP performance for Uber’s apps by moving to a network stack that supports the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State of the Art: TCP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On today’s Internet,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is the most widely adopted transport protocol for carrying HTTPS traffic. TCP provides a reliable byte stream, dealing with the complexities of network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;congestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and link layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The widespread use of TCP for HTTPS traffic is mainly attributed to ubiquity (almost every OS includes TCP), availability on a wide range of infrastructure, such as load balancers, HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;proxies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/content-distribution-network.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDNs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and it’s out-of-the-box functionality for most platforms and networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most users access Uber’s services on the move, and the tail-end latencies of our applications running on TCP were far from meeting the requirements of the real-time nature of our HTTPS traffic. Specifically, users perceived high tail-end latencies across the world. In Figure 1, below, we plot the tail-end latencies of our HTTPS network calls across major cities:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6101&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3.png 1695w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-300x149.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-768x382.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-1024x509.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-324x160.png 324w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-696x346.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-1068x531.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-845x420.png 845w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 1. Tail-end latencies vary across the major cities where Uber operates.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the latencies in India and Brazil’s networks were worse than those in the US and UK, the tail-end latencies are significantly higher than the average latencies, even in the case of the US and UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TCP Performance over wireless&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TCP was originally designed for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;wired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;networks, which have largely predictable links. However,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;wireless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;networks have unique characteristics and challenges. Firstly, wireless networks are susceptible to losses from interference and signal attenuation. For instance, WiFi networks are susceptible to interference from microwaves, bluetooth, and other types of radio waves. Cellular networks are affected by signal loss (or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_loss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;path loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) due to reflection/absorption by things in the environment, such as buildings, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-channel_interference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;interference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;from neighboring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artizanetworks.com/resources/tutorials/what_lteenb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;base stations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These result in much higher (e.g: 4-10x) and variable Round-trip times (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RTTs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and packet loss than wired counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To overcome intermittent fluctuations in bandwidth and loss, cellular networks typically employ large buffers to absorb traffic bursts. Large buffers can cause excessive queueing, causing longer delays. TCP often interprets such queuing as loss due to time out durations, so it tends to retransmit and further fill up the buffer. This problem, known as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2071893&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bufferbloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is a major&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/paper/cellnet/p1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in today’s Internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, cellular network performance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;varies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;significantly across carriers, regions, and time. In Figure 2, below, we plot the median latencies of HTTPS traffic in Uber’s rider app across hexagons of 2 kilometers for two major mobile carriers in Delhi, India. As can be seen in the figure, the network performance varies significantly across the hexagons in the same city. Also, the performance is significantly different for two of the top carriers. Factors such as user access patterns based on location and time, user mobility, and the network deployment of the carrier based on the density of the towers and the proportion of the types of networks (LTE, 3G, etc.) cause network load variations across location and carriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to varying across locations, the cellular network performance varies over time. As shown in Figure 3, below, the median latency across two kilometer hexagons for the same region within Delhi and the same carrier fluctuates across the days of the week. We also saw variations within finer time scales, such as within a day and an hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6102&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;145&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png 1822w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-300x73.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-768x186.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-1024x248.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-696x168.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-1068x259.png 1068w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 3: Tail-end latencies can vary considerably from day to day, on the same carrier.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above characteristics translate into inefficiencies in TCP’s performance on wireless networks. However, before looking into alternatives to TCP,  we wanted to develop a key understanding of the problem space by assessing the following considerations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is TCP the main contributor to the high tail-end latencies on our mobile applications?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do current networks have significantly high RTT variance and losses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the impact of the high RTTs and losses on the performance of TCP?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;TCP performance analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To better understand how we analyze TCP performance, let’s first briefly explain how TCP transfers data from a sender to a receiver. Initially, the sender sets up a TCP connection by performing a three-way&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;handshake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: the sender transmits a SYN packet, waits for a SYN-ACK packet from the receiver, then sends an ACK packet. An additional two to three round trips are spent on setting up a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;connection. Each data packet is ACKed by the receiver to ensure reliable delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case that a packet or ACK is lost, the sender retransmits the packet after the expiration of a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6298&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;retransmission timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(RTO). The RTO is dynamically computed based on various factors, such as the estimate of the RTT between the sender and the receiver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6111&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png 1419w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-300x162.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-768x416.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-1024x554.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-696x377.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-1068x578.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-776x420.png 776w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 4: TCP/TLS packet exchanges include a mechanism to retransmit lost packets.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine how the TCP flow was performing in our apps, we collected TCP packet traces using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcpdump.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for a week of production traffic from Uber’s edge servers for connections originating from India. We then analyzed the TCP connections using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcptrace.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcptrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In addition, we also built an Android application that sends emulated traffic to a test server closely mimicking real traffic. The application collects TCP traces in the background, and uploads the logs to a back-end server. Android phones running this application were handed out to a few employees in India, who collected logs for a period of a few days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results were consistent from both experiments. We witnessed high RTT values, and tail-end values being almost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;six times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;the median value, with an average variance of more than one second. Additionally, most connections were lossy, causing TCP to retransmit 3.5 percent of total packets. In congested locations, such as railway stations and airports, we witnessed as high as 7 percent of packets being dropped by the network. These results challenge a common notion that cellular networks’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharetechnote.com/html/BasicProcedure_LTE_HARQ.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;advanced retransmission schemes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;significantly reduce losses at the transport layer. Below, we outline our results running tests on our mock application:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTT in msecs [50%,75%, 95%,99%]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;[350, 425, 725, 2300]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTT variance in secs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average ~ 1.2 seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet Loss Rate in lossy connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average ~3.5% (7% in congestion areas)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost half of these connections saw at least one packet loss, with a significant number of connections suffering losses of SYN and SYN-ACK packets. Since TCP uses highly conservative RTO values for retransmitting SYN and SYN-ACK packets compared to data packets, most TCP implementations use an initial RTO of one second for SYN packets, with the RTO exponentially increased for subsequent losses. The initial load time of the application can suffer as TCP takes more time to setup the connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of data packets, high RTOs effectively reduce network utilization in the presence of transient losses in the wireless networks. We found that the average time to retransmit is around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with tail-end times being almost 30 seconds. These high delays in the TCP layer were causing the HTTPS transfer to timeout and retry the request, leading to further latency and network inefficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the 75th percentile of the measured RTTs on our networks was around 425 milliseconds, the 75th percentile of TCP back-off was almost three seconds. This result implies that losses cause TCP to take 7 times-10 times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;round-trips to actually transmit the data successfully. This can be attributed to the inefficient computation of RTOs, TCP’s inability to react quickly to loss of last few packets in a window (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41217.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tail loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), and inefficiencies in the congestion control algorithm, which does not differentiate between wireless losses and losses due to network congestion. Below, we outline the results of our TCP packet loss tests:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;[1,3,6,7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adopting QUIC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Originally designed by Google,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is a stream-multiplexed modern transport protocol implemented over UDP.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, QUIC is being standardized as a part of an ongoing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;IETF effort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As depicted in Figure 5, below, QUIC transparently sits under HTTP/3 (HTTP/2 over QUIC is being standardized as HTTP/3). It replaces portions of HTTPS and TCP layers on the stack, using UDP for packet framing. QUIC only supports secure data transmission, hence the TLS layer is completely embedded within QUIC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6109&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8.png 940w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8-300x136.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8-768x347.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8-696x315.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image8-929x420.png 929w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 5: QUIC sits under HTTP/3, absorbing the secure TLS layer which formerly ran under HTTP/2.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below, we outline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that made it compelling for us to adopt QUIC in addition to TCP for this edge communication:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0-RTT connection establishment:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC allows reuse of the security credential established in previous connections, reducing the overhead of secure connection handshakes by way of sending data in the first round trip. In the future,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/blog/tls13/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLS1.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;will support 0-RTT, but the TCP three-way handshake will still be required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming HoL blocking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;HTTP/2 uses a single TCP connection to each origin to improve performance, but this can lead to head-of-line (HoL) blocking. For instance, an object B (e.g, trip request) may get blocked behind another object A (e.g, logging request) which experiences loss. In this case, delivery of B is delayed until A can recover from the loss. However, QUIC facilitates multiplexing and delivers a request to the application independent of other requests that are being exchanged.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congestion control:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC sits in the application layer, making it easier to update the core algorithm of the transport protocol that controls the sending rate based on network conditions, such as packet loss and RTT. Most TCP deployments use the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos561/papers/Cubic08.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CUBIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;algorithm, which is not optimal for delay-sensitive traffic. Recently developed algorithms, such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, model the network more accurately and optimize for latency. QUIC lets us enable BBR and update the algorithm as it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-iccrg-an-update-on-bbr-work-at-google-00&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evolves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC invokes two tail loss probes (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-01&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) before RTO is triggered even when a loss is outstanding, which is different from some TCP implementations. TLP essentially retransmits the last packet (or a new packet, if available) to trigger fast recovery. Tail loss handling is particularly useful for Uber’s network traffic patterns, which are composed of short, sporadic latency-sensitive transfers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized ACKing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt; Since each packet carries a unique sequence number, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2016/karns-algorithm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of distinguishing retransmission from delayed packets is eliminated. The ACK packets also contain the time to process the packet and generate the ACK at the client level. These features ensure that QUIC more accurately estimates the RTT. QUIC’s ACKs support up to 256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/nack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NACK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;ranges, helping the sender to be more resilient to packet reordering and ensuring fewer bytes on the wire. Selective ACK (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SACK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) in TCP does not resolve this problem in all cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Migration:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC connections are identified by a 64 bit connection ID, so that if a client changes IP addresses, it can continue to use the old connection ID from the new IP address without interrupting any in-flight requests. This is a common occurrence in mobile applications when a user switches between WiFi and cellular connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Alternatives to QUIC considered&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before settling on QUIC, we looked into alternative approaches to improving TCP performance across our apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first tried deploying TCP Points of Presence (PoPs) to terminate the TCP connections closer to users. Essentially, PoPs terminates the TCP connection to the mobile device closer to the cellular network and reverse proxies the traffic to the original infrastructure. By terminating the TCP closer, we can potentially reduce the RTT, and ensure that TCP is more reactive to the dynamic wireless environment. However, our experiments proved that the bulk of the RTT and loss is coming from cellular networks and use of PoPs did not provide a significant performance improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also looked into tuning the parameters of TCP to improve app performance. Tuning TCP stacks across our heterogeneous edge servers was challenging, since TCP has disparate implementations across different versions of the OS. It was difficult to apply and verify the different configuration changes across the network. Tuning the TCP configurations on the mobile devices themselves was impossible due to a lack of privileges. More fundamentally, features like 0-RTT connections and better RTT estimation are central to protocol design and it is not possible to reap such benefits by simply tuning TCP alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, we assessed a few&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Media_Flow_Protocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UDP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;-based protocols that have addressed shortcomings for video streaming to see if they might be leveraged for our use case.  However, they lack industry grade security features and typically assume a complementary TCP connection for metadata and control information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the best of our knowledge and based on our research, QUIC was one of very few protocols that addressed the general problem for Internet traffic, taking into account both security and performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC integration on the Uber platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To successfully integrate QUIC and improve app performance in low connectivity networks, we replaced Uber’s legacy networking stack (HTTP/2 over TLS/TCP) with the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;We leveraged the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cronet¹&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;networking library from the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chromium Projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;which implement a version of the QUIC protocol (gQUIC) that was originally designed by Google. The implementation is continuously&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evolving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to follow the latest IETF specification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first integrated Cronet into our Android applications to enable QUIC support. The integration was done in a way to ensure zero migration cost for our mobile engineers. Instead of completely replacing our legacy network stack that used the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://square.github.io/okhttp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OkHttp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;library, we integrated the Cronet library under the OkHttp API framework. By performing the integration in this way, we avoided changes to the API layer of our network calls, which rely on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://square.github.io/retrofit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Retrofit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, we also avoided changing core networking functions that perform such tasks as failover, redirects, and compression. We leveraged the interceptor mechanism of OkHttp to implement middleware to seamlessly intercept HTTP traffic from the application and send the traffic to the Cronet library using Java&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/cronet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We still use the OkHttp library in cases where the Cronet library fails to load for certain Android devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to our Android approach, we integrated Cronet into Uber’s iOS applications by intercepting HTTP traffic from the iOS networking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlprotocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NSURLProtocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This abstraction, provided by the iOS Foundation, handles loading protocol-specific URL data and ensures that we can integrate Cronet into our iOS applications without significant migration costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC termination on Google Cloud Load Balancers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the backend, the QUIC termination is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;provided&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;by a Google Cloud Load balancing infrastructure that supports QUIC using the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;alt-svc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;header on responses. Essentially, on every HTTP response, the load balancer adds an alt-svc header that validates QUIC support for that domain. When the Cronet client receives an HTTP response with an alt-svc header, it uses QUIC for the following HTTP requests sent to that domain. Once the load balancer terminates QUIC, our infrastructure transparently forwards it over HTTP2/TCP to our back-end data centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given performance is the primary reason for our exploration of a better transport protocol, we first set up a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/production-engineering/augmented-traffic-control-a-tool-to-simulate-network-conditions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;network emulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;testbed to study how QUIC performs under different network profiles in the lab. To verify QUIC’s performance gains in real networks, we then conducted on-road experiments in New Delhi using emulated traffic that closely replays the highly frequent HTTPS network calls in our rider application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experiment one&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experiment setup, outlined below, consists of the following components:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Android test devices with the OkHttp and Cronet network stack to ensure we can run HTTPS traffic over both TCP and QUIC, respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Java-based emulation server that sends stubbed HTTPS response headers and payloads to the client devices upon receiving HTTPS requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proxies placed in a cloud region close to India to terminate the TCP and QUIC connections. While we used the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NGINX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;reverse proxy to terminate TCP, it was challenging to find an openly available reverse proxy for QUIC. We built a QUIC reverse proxy in-house using the core QUIC stack from Chromium and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/4380217c0aa51adff8f624ba412e415e6493413a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;contributed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the proxy back to Chromium as open source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6110&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;153&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png 1380w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-300x115.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-768x294.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1024x392.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-696x266.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1068x409.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1098x420.png 1098w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 6 : Our on-road experimental setup to test QUIC versus TCP performance consisted of Android devices running the OkHttp and Cronet stacks, cloud-based proxies to terminate the connections, and an emulation server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results from this experiment showed that QUIC consistently and very significantly outperformed TCP in terms of latency when downloading the HTTPS responses on the devices. Specifically, we witnessed a 50 percent reduction in latencies across the board, from the 50th percentile to 99th percentile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experiment two&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once Google made QUIC available within&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-quic-support-https-load-balancing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Cloud Load Balancing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we repeated the same experiment setup with one modification: instead of using NGINX, we used the Google Cloud load balancers to terminate the TCP and QUIC connections from the devices and forward the HTTPS traffic to an emulated server. These load balancers are spread across the globe, with the closest PoP server selected based on the geolocation of the device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6106&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png 1800w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-300x128.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-768x327.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-1024x436.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-696x297.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-1068x455.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-986x420.png 986w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 8: In our second experimental setup, we wanted to compare the latency of TCP and QUIC terminating at the Google Cloud versus using our own cloud-based proxy.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We encountered a few interesting insights from this second experiment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoP termination improved TCP performance:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Since the Google Cloud load balancers terminate the TCP connection closer to users and are well-tuned for performance, the resulting lower RTTs significantly improved the TCP performance. Although QUIC’s gains were lower, it still out-performed TCP by about a 10-30 percent reduction in tail-end latency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long tail impacted by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cellular/wireless hops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Even though our in-house QUIC proxy  was farther away from the device (approximately 50 milliseconds higher latency) than the Google Cloud load balancers, it offered similar performance gains (a 15 percent reduction as opposed to a 20 percent reduction in the 99th percentile against TCP). These results suggests that the last-mile cellular hop is the main bottleneck in the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6113&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png 633w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12-300x185.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12-356x220.png 356w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 7. Results from two experiments we ran testing latency showed significant performance gains for QUIC versus TCP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Production traffic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Encouraged by previous tests, we proceeded by adding QUIC support into our Android and iOS applications. We performed an A/B test between QUIC and TCP to quantify the impact of QUIC across all cities in which Uber operates. Overall, we saw significant reductions in the tail-end latencies across various dimensions, such as region, carrier, and network type.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 9, below, depicts the percentage improvements in the tail-end latencies (95th and 99th percentile) across different mega-regions and network types (including LTE, 3G, and 2G.):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 8. In our production tests, QUIC consistently outperformed TCP in terms of latency over regions and network types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are just getting started: deploying QUIC for mobile applications at our scale has paved the way for several exciting avenues to improve application performance across both high and low connectivity networks, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Increase QUIC coverage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the analysis of the protocol’s actual performance on real traffic, we observed that around 80 percent of sessions successfully used QUIC for all requests, while about 15 percent of them used a mix of TCP and QUIC. Our current hypothesis about this mix is that the Cronet code library switches back to TCP upon timeouts since it cannot distinguish UDP failures and actual poor network conditions. We are currently working to solve this problem as we move forward with leveraging the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC optimization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The traffic from Uber’s mobile applications are typically latency-sensitive as opposed to bandwidth-intensive. Also, our applications are primarily accessed using cellular networks. Based on our experiments, the tail-end latencies are still higher despite using proxies that terminate TCP and QUIC close to the user. Our team is actively working on investigating further improvements to control congestion and improve loss recovery algorithms for QUIC to optimize for latency based on our traffic and user access patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With these improvements and others, we plan to  further enhance the user experience on our platform regardless of network or region, making convenient and seamless transportation more accessible across our global markets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;loop-post-meta loop-post-meta-single&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-share-buttons&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;May 20, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;73&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to announce that Geoff Ralston is taking over for me as President of YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve known Geoff for almost ten years, he’s been a YC partner for eight, and I think he’s one of the most thoughtful, helpful, and kind investors in Silicon Valley. One of my earliest memories of Geoff is him laying on the floor of the first Stripe office helping the founders redline a contract for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff manages to combine a broad background of knowledge, expansive thinking about the future, and being a coworker that everyone likes in a way that is very rare (usually people have at most two out of the three).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cares a lot about YC and understands what makes it work. I feel a deeply shared vision with him for what YC should be. In my conversations with Geoff about whether or not we should fund a particular company (we often did interviews together), I can’t remember a single major disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took over from PG, one of the things we talked most about was how to make YC last for a very long time. I’ve worked hard to build the organization in that direction, and I feel confident that Geoff is the best choice to really cement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a true pleasure to work with the entire YC partnership–in different ways, every YC partner is immensely talented, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They collectively operate at a scale and level that I don’t think the industry has seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on OpenAI has been more exciting (and more complex) than I ever imagined, and I’m excited to be able to focus on it more fully. And I’m very thankful that YC will be in such good hands with Geoff–I care about YC more than I thought I’d care about any organization. I will, of course, remain an advisor to YC, and will be around to help Geoff as he takes on his new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>This Old House: The Rare Home-Improvement Show That Spotlights Skilled Workers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/old-houses-legacy-home-improvement-tv/589372/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in its 40th season, the PBS home-improvement show &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; feels like the TV equivalent of New England clam chowder: hearty, wholesome, and old-school. The cast—headed up by the master carpenter Norm Abram and rounded out by the contractor Tom Silva, gardener Roger Cook, plumber Richard Trethewey, and host Kevin O’Connor—returns autumn after autumn, as consistently as uncles you might see every year at Thanksgiving dinner. The look and feel of the series hasn’t changed much since its debut in February 1979. Each episode still zeroes in on a few elements of home construction, such as installing a skylight or shoring up a foundation. In one of the rare, subtle signs that four decades have passed, Silva appears to be wearing an Apple Watch in a recent episode.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Every program on HGTV arguably owes its existence to &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt;, which first turned home renovation and real estate into television. Without it, viewers might never have gotten &lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;, or probably even &lt;em&gt;House Hunters International&lt;/em&gt;. All the same, it can be difficult to locate the similarities between &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; and its descendants. These newer programs often unfold like reality TV–esque hero’s journeys, with the hosts figuring as creative geniuses who marshal old or otherwise sad houses through a rapid-fire rehabilitation and beautification process. &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, has no single star and little concern for dramatic narrative arcs. Its chief goal is, as it always has been, to put skilled tradespeople and the work they do in front of the camera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt;, workers solve technical problems that seldom merit a mention on programs of the HGTV variety. In a recent episode, the crew is briefly flummoxed over where to install electrical outlets in a modern, minimalist kitchen that has prioritized windows over usable wall space. The building code mandates that outlets should be placed every few feet, but O’Connor clarifies the problem for the audience, asking, “Where do you put an outlet when there’s no wall?” The supervising electrician, Heath Eastman, devises an ingenious solution: He conceals the outlets in receptacles that can be pressed down into the countertop. The homeowner, Sunil, isn’t enthused about the prospect of disrupting the clean lines of the counter with pop-ups, but he takes a sensible view of the matter. “I personally wouldn’t want anything on the surface, but code is code and we have to have it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene is quintessential &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt;. What could’ve been framed as a melodramatic battle of the wills is instead presented as a teachable moment between the tradesman and the homeowner. The show is fairly unusual among home-renovation programs in allowing workers like Eastman to speak at length and explain their craft to a national audience. &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; keeps them at the forefront of the action, perhaps realizing that, without them, there’d be no action at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; first launched, there was little to suggest that it would be the progenitor of a new genre of TV. That inaugural, 13-episode season from 1979 initially seemed to be a Boston-area curiosity, accessible only to local residents via WGBH. But it struck a chord with viewers, almost 250,000 of whom tuned in every week to watch the titular house—&lt;a href=&quot;https://curbed.com/2019/2/19/18229435/this-old-house-bob-vila-dorchester-ma-real-estate&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;a struggling Victorian in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;—undergo its gradual metamorphosis. The surge of interest allowed &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; to vault into the primary PBS lineup a year later, where it has remained ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the show has developed into a multiplatform media powerhouse. In addition to the flagship program, viewers can tune in to the spin-off TV show &lt;em&gt;Ask This Old House&lt;/em&gt;, in which the cast helps homeowners with smaller-scale repairs and upgrades. Fans can also read &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; magazine or follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThisOldHouse&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;the brand on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where the account cheerfully dispenses home-maintenance advice to 198,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt;, of course, competes for eyeballs with a slate of newer shows hosted by highly telegenic and charismatic individuals. Audiences marvel at the gracious collectedness of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Gaines (who alone has 1.4 million Twitter followers), and wonder how she puts up with her goofy husband, Chip, as she floats around imposing a neutral-hued elegance on recalcitrant domestic interiors. Drew and Jonathan Scott hold together each episode of their various &lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt; shows with their banter, fraternal competition, and identical good looks. It’s not for nothing that the Gaineses and the Scotts regularly feature on the covers of tabloids. These stars &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; their shows, because they seemingly carry the entire weight of the production on their shoulders.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the celebrity attached to home-improvement show hosts means that little attention is paid to the skilled tradespeople who improve the homes in question. When these workers do appear on camera, it’s usually in montages. Their movements are often sped up for the sake of time, so they scuttle around like chipmunks, hammering, carrying, plastering, painting. Their work, whether intentionally or not, is positioned as secondary to the dynamism of the main stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this clearly on HGTV’s new show &lt;em&gt;Windy City Rehab&lt;/em&gt;, which recently ended its first season. The title suggests that the show is about renovating homes in Chicago, but it’s really about Alison Victoria, the star, who poses with a sledgehammer in promotional shots. Victoria is a professional home flipper, and it’s hard not to admire her style. She evaluates properties with a caustic realism that brings to mind Simon Cowell: “The windows are a mess, the awning is awful, the glass block is disgusting.” As a home flipper, Victoria chiefly aims to turn the largest profit possible from selling her creations, and we watch her battle against time, weather, and occasional bureaucratic red tape to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria has an edge to her, which is likely a requirement for a woman trying to succeed in a field that is still dominated by men. “It’s not for the weak,” she says of her chosen profession in a March episode. Understandably, she strives to control as many aspects of the project as possible. “If you want something done right, you do it yourself,” she remarks, after a set of kitchen cabinets turns out too short due to a measuring error on the part of a contractor. When she sources vintage pieces at a furniture restorer’s workshop, the exchange largely consists of her telling the craftsman what she wants. Workers only fleetingly appear in the usual construction montages. This overlooking of tradespeople is certainly not unique to Victoria’s show—it’s only the latest manifestation of a pattern that has come to define home-renovation TV as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If skilled workers are largely written out of television shows that rely on their expertise to function, it’s not surprising that fewer young people than ever are pursuing careers in trade. There is a genuine shortage of skilled labor in the United States, caused by, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/when-expert-tradespeople-are-hard-to-find/2018/04/18/f668d874-2d4b-11e8-8688-e053ba58f1e4_story.html?utm_term=.1467ad39fbc9&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lingering effects of the Great Recession, the retirement of veteran laborers, and “the fact that many high-school graduates are not interested in blue-collar jobs.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/blue-collar-worker-shortage-turns-u-s-labor-market-on-its-head&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;This issue is undoubtedly a complex one&lt;/a&gt;, but media representations of trade might bear at least some scrutiny. Who wants to be reduced to the backdrop while the true drama takes place in the foreground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; stands apart from its competition by keeping its workers in the spotlight—young apprentices included. The 16th episode of Season 40, titled “Apprentice Sill School,” features the great Norm Abram instructing two apprentices, Carly and Erick, in how to install a “sill,” or layer of wood, on the foundation of a home. This hidden piece keeps our walls from falling in on us—it supports a building’s frame and floor joists. As viewers watch, they see Carly and Erick learning exactly how a house comes together. Their movements are a little awkward as they use hammers to smooth the edges of the foundation before the sills can be installed. Their work is slow and hesitant. The only noticeable sounds in these scenes are Abram’s voice and the clink of metal on concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no accident that &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; devotes so much time to apprentices like Carly and Erick. They’re on-screen as part of the show’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisoldhouse.com/more/generation-next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;“Generation Next” initiative&lt;/a&gt;—a broad program aimed at recruiting more people to the trades. In launching this initiative, the show is attempting to counter the U.S. labor shortage by making carpentry and other hands-on professions seem more accessible to young men and women alike. Generation Next has been putting apprentices on the show since 2017, providing them with training and national-television exposure. “There’s every reason to go into the building trades today,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/generation-next-steps-to-close-skills-gap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;Tom Silva has said&lt;/a&gt;. “If you are good, you will absolutely have work.” He’s not exaggerating: The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts enticing job prospects for workers in a variety of fields, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/plumbers-pipefitters-and-steamfitters.htm#tab-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;plumbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/glaziers.htm#tab-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;glaziers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/brickmasons-blockmasons-and-stonemasons.htm#tab-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;masons&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation Next is a natural offshoot of what was already present in the structure and priorities of &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; from the beginning, especially in the way that it provides a voice and visibility to skilled tradesmen and women. As the series moves into its fifth decade, its investment in younger workers signifies a promising new direction: a way for this admittedly old show to reach the audience that most needs to absorb its message.  &lt;/p&gt;

<title>GDPR adtech complaints keep stacking up in Europe</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;It’s a year since Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;) came into force and leaky adtech is now facing privacy complaints in four more European Union markets. This ups the tally to seven markets where data protection authorities have been urged to investigate a core function of behavioral advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fixad.tech/ad-tech-gdpr-complaint-is-extended-to-five-more-european-regulators/&quot;&gt;latest clutch of GDPR complaints&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the real-time bidding (RTB) system have been filed in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the complaints argue that RTB entails “wide-scale and systemic” breaches of Europe’s data protection regime, as personal date harvested to profile Internet users for ad-targeting purposes is broadcast widely to bidders in the adtech chain. The complaints have implications for key adtech players, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and the Internet Advertising Bureau, which set RTB standards used by other in the online adverting pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to Google and IAB Europe for comment on the latest complaints. (The latter’s original response statement to the complaint can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iabeurope.eu/all-news/press-releases/iab-europes-press-statement-openrtb-and-eu-data-protection-law/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, behind its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/cookie-walls-dont-comply-with-gdpr-says-dutch-dpa/&quot;&gt;cookie wall&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first RTB complaints were filed in the UK and Ireland, last fall, by Dr &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/johnny-ryan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;johnny-ryan&quot;&gt;Johnny Ryan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/blockchain-browser-brave-starts-opt-in-testing-of-on-device-ad-targeting/&quot;&gt;private browser Brave&lt;/a&gt;; Jim Killock, director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openrightsgroup.org/&quot;&gt;Open Rights Group&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikarv&quot;&gt;Michael Veale&lt;/a&gt;, a data and policy researcher at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third complaint went in to Poland’s DPA in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/27/google-and-iab-ad-category-lists-show-massive-leakage-of-highly-intimate-data-gdpr-complaint-claims/&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;, filed by anti-surveillance NGO, the Panoptykon Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest four complaints have been lodged in Spain by Gemma Galdon Clavell (Eticas Foundation) and Diego Fanjul (Finch); David Korteweg (Bits of Freedom) in the Netherlands; Jef Ausloos (University of Amsterdam) and Pierre Dewitte (University of Leuven) in Belgium; and Jose Belo (Exigo Luxembourg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year a lawyer working with the complainants said they’re expecting “a cascade of complaints” across Europe — and “fully expect an EU-wide regulatory response” give that the adtech in question is applied region-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting in a statement, Galdon Cavell, the CEO of Eticas, said: “We hope that this complaint sends a strong message to Google and those using Ad Tech solutions in their websites and products. Data protection is a legal requirement must be translated into practices and technical specifications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‘bug’ disclosed &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/twitter-bug-disclosed-some-users-location-data-to-an-unnamed-partner/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; by Twitter illustrates the potential privacy risks around adtech, with the social networking platform revealing it had inadvertently shared some iOS users’ location data with an ad partner during the RTB process. (Less clear is who else might Twitter’s “trusted advertising partner” have passed people’s information to?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core argument underpinning the complaints is that RTB’s data processing is not secure — given the design of the system entails the broadcasting of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/27/google-and-iab-ad-category-lists-show-massive-leakage-of-highly-intimate-data-gdpr-complaint-claims/&quot;&gt;what can be sensitive and intimate&lt;/a&gt;) personal data of Internet users to all sorts of third parties in order to generate bids for ad space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas GDPR bakes in a requirement for personal data to be processed “in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data”. So, uh, spot the disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest RTB complaints assert personal data is broadcast via bid requests “hundreds of billions of times” per day — which it describes as “the most massive leakage of personal data recorded so far”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the complaints focus on security risks attached by default to leaky adtech, such a long chain of third parties being passed people’s data also raises plenty of questions over the validity of any claimed ‘consents’ for passing Internet users’ data down the adtech chain. (Related: A decision by the French CNIL &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/&quot;&gt;last fall&lt;/a&gt; against a small local adtech player which it decided was unlawfully processing personal data obtained via RTB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week will mark a year since GDPR came into force across the EU. And it’s fair to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/privacy-complaints-received-by-tech-giants-favorite-eu-watchdog-up-more-than-2x-since-gdpr/&quot;&gt;privacy complaints have been piling up&lt;/a&gt;, while enforcement actions — such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/&quot;&gt;$57M fine for Google&lt;/a&gt; from the French CNIL related to Android consent — remain far rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One complexity with the RTB complaints is that the technology systems in question are both applied across EU borders and involve multiple entities (Google and the IAB). This means multiple privacy watchdogs need to work together to determine which of them is legally competent to address linked complaints that touch EU citizens in multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who leads can depend on where an entity has its main establishment in the EU and/or who is the data controller. If this is not clearly established it’s possible that various national actions could flow from the complaints, given the cross-border nature of the adtech — as in the CNIL decision against &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/android&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;android&quot;&gt;Android,&lt;/a&gt; for example. (Though Google made a policy change as of January 22, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-service-model-europe/&quot;&gt;shifting its legal base for EU law enforcement to Google Ireland&lt;/a&gt; which looks intended to funnel all GDPR risk via the Irish DPC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IAB Europe, meanwhile, has an office in Belgium but it’s not clear whether that’s the data controller in this case. Ausloos tells us that the Belgian DPA has already declared itself competent regarding the complaint filed against the IAB by the Panoptykon Foundation, while noting another possibility — that the IAB claims the data controller is IAB Tech Lab, based in New York — “in which case any and all DPAs across the EU would be competent”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veale also says different DPAs could argue that different parts of the IAB are in their jurisdiction. “We don’t know how the IAB structure really works, it’s very opaque,” he tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irish DPC, which Google has sought to designate the lead watchdog for its European business, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/privacy-complaints-received-by-tech-giants-favorite-eu-watchdog-up-more-than-2x-since-gdpr/&quot;&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; it will prioritize scrutiny of the adtech sector in 2019, referencing the RTB complaints in its annual report &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/privacy-complaints-received-by-tech-giants-favorite-eu-watchdog-up-more-than-2x-since-gdpr/&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — where it warned the industry: “the protection of personal data is a prerequisite to the processing of any personal data within this ecosystem and ultimately the sector must comply with the standards set down by the GDPR”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no update on how the UK’s ICO is tackling the RTB complaint filed in the UK as yet — but Veale notes they have a call today. (And we’ve reached out to the ICO for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the same RTB complaints have not been filed in France and Germany — jurisdictions with privacy watchdogs that can have a reputation for some of the most muscular action enforcing data protection in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Belgian DPA’s recently elected new president is making muscular noises about GDPR enforcement, according to Ausloos — who cites a speech he made, post-election, saying the ‘time of sit back and relax’ is over. They made sure to reference these comments in the RTB complaint, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veale suggests the biggest blocker to resolving the RTB complaints is that all the various EU watchdogs “need a vision of what the world looks like after they take a given action”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, the adtech complaints keep stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MicroG – Re-implementation of proprietary Android apps and libraries</title>
<link>https://microg.org</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://microg.org</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;jumbotron&quot;&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;A free-as-in-freedom re-implementation of Google’s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linux-based open-source mobile operating system Android is not only the most popular mobile operating system in the world, it’s also on the way to becoming a proprietary operating system. How is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the core operating system is still released as part of the Android Open Source Project, the majority of core apps are not. It gets worse: More and more libraries and APIs are only available on phones that run various Google apps pre-installed, effectively locking third-party apps to the Google ecosystem. For these reasons Android is &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/4/&quot;&gt;described as being&lt;/a&gt; a “&lt;em&gt;look but don’t touch&lt;/em&gt;” kind of open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, several popular open-source applications already require some of Google’s proprietary libraries to be installed. Increasing demand in the free software community in addition to severe problems in Google’s proprietary software discovered by the Android modding community, have led to the development of a free software clone of Google’s proprietary core libraries and applications - the microG Project was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most microG components are far from complete, users are amazed by the results. Free software users got extended application support, privacy-caring users can reduce or monitor data that is sent to Google and especially older phones can expect some battery life improvements. microG is not only used on real devices, but also replaces Google tools in test emulators and is even used in virtual mobile infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
