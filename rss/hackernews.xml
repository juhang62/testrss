<description>&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO —&lt;/span&gt; The billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service’s strategy and Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, according to people familiar with internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Koum, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/business/whats-up-with-whatsapp/2014/02/20/b4635dfa-9a79-11e3-9900-dd917233cf9c_video.html?utm_term=.871624afcae8&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;sold WhatsApp to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more than $19 billion in 2014, also plans to step down from Facebook’s board of directors, according to these people. The date of his departure isn’t known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;It “is time for me to move on,” Koum wrote in a Facebook post after The Washington Post reported his plans to depart. He has been informing senior executives at Facebook and WhatsApp of his decision, and in recent months has been showing up less frequently to WhatsApp’s offices on Facebook’s campus in Silicon Valley, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The independence and protection of its users’ data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016. The clash over data took on additional significance in the wake of revelations in March that Facebook had allowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/facebooks-rules-for-accessing-user-data-lured-more-than-just-cambridge-analytica/2018/03/19/31f6979c-658e-43d6-a71f-afdd8bf1308b_story.html?utm_term=.d862fb861fe9&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;third parties to mishandle its users’ personal information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg replied to Koum’s post by crediting Koum with teaching him “about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people’s hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Facebook, though, needs to prove that its investment in WhatsApp — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/02/19/scale-of-facebooks-19-billion-whatsapp-acquisition-in-1-chart/?utm_term=.778123e6b754&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;its largest acquisition ever&lt;/a&gt; — was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;“Part of Facebook’s success has been to digest acquisitions, successfully monetize them, and integrate them into their advertising machine,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for research firm GBH Insights. But WhatsApp has been more challenging because of resistance from the founders, he said. “This was a massive culture clash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Koum’s exit is highly unusual at Facebook. The inner circle of management, as well as the board of directors, have been fiercely loyal during the scandals that have rocked the social media giant. In addition, Koum is the sole founder of a company acquired by Facebook to serve on its board. Only two other Facebook executives, Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, are members of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the reasons for Koum’s departure but didn’t dispute the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;In his Facebook post, Koum said he would take some time off from technology to focus on other pursuits, “such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Acton left the company in November. He has joined a chorus of former executives critical of Facebook. Acton recently endorsed a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign that has gained force in the wake of the controversy over data privacy sparked by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm tied to the Trump campaign that had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/17/a-voter-profiling-firm-hired-by-trump-likely-grabbed-data-for-tens-of-millions-of-facebook-users/?utm_term=.2d1b4fe29aba&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;inappropriately obtained the private information&lt;/a&gt; of 87 million Facebook users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Though the Cambridge Analytica revelations contributed to a climate of broader frustration with Facebook among WhatsApp employees, Koum made his decision to leave before the scandal, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. It is most popular in countries such as India, Egypt and Brazil, as well as in Europe, where it is used for phone calls and text messaging with friends and businesses, as well as news distribution and group chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton, former co-workers at Yahoo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/02/19/what-is-whatsapp-the-company-that-facebook-just-bought-for-16-billion/?utm_term=.dae7337e60cf&quot;&gt;founded WhatsApp in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. It promised private communications for 99 cents a year. By 2014, the tiny company had almost 500 million users. It caught the attention of Zuckerberg, who was looking to expand the social network overseas. After a dinner at Zuckerberg’s house, Zuckerberg made an offer for WhatsApp that turned Acton and Koum into instant billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;But even in the early days, there were signs of a mismatch. WhatsApp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/what-the-whatsapp-deal-reveals-about-facebooks-future/2014/02/20/8f3a4f7e-9a34-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html?utm_term=.9818bb3875b7&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;had less than $20 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the acquisition. Facebook was making billions of dollars by selling advertisers access to its users, on whom it had collected large amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton were openly disparaging of the targeted advertising model. In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012, they wrote that “no one wakes up excited to see more advertising; no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow.” They described online advertising as “a disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;The WhatsApp co-founders were also big believers in privacy. They took pains to collect as little data as possible from their users, requiring only phone numbers and putting them at odds with data-hungry Facebook. At the time of the acquisition, Koum and Acton said Facebook had assured them that WhatsApp could remain an independent service and would not share its data with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;How and if WhatsApp would make money was left an open question. “WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,” the founders in wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. “And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Eighteen months later, the promise not to share data evaporated. Facebook pushed WhatsApp to change its terms of service to give the social network access to the phone numbers of WhatsApp users, along with analytics such as what devices and operating systems people were using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;WhatsApp executives were comfortable sharing some data with Facebook to measure who was using the service, according to the people. But they opposed using WhatsApp’s data to create a user profile that was unified across Facebook’s multiple platforms, which also include Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and that could be used for ad-targeting or for Facebook’s data-mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Acton and Koum acquiesced, enabling Facebook to recommend that users’ WhatsApp contacts become their Facebook friends and making it possible for Facebook to collect more data about those relationships. The changes also allowed advertisers to feed lists of phone numbers into Facebook’s advertising system, known as Custom Audience, and find new people to target with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Last year, the European Commission, the European Union’s regulatory authority, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm&quot;&gt;fined Facebook $122 million&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/eu-fines-facebook-110m-over-whatsapp-deal/2017/05/18/1f556562-3bdb-11e7-a59b-26e0451a96fd_video.html?utm_term=.6d87f08b6bac&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;making “misleading” statements&lt;/a&gt; when the E.U. approved the WhatsApp takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Conflicts soon arose over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook scrapped the 99-cent annual charge, and Koum and Acton continued to oppose the advertising model. The service still has no ads, but WhatsApp has embarked on experiments to make money: In January, Facebook rolled out a tool, called WhatsApp Business, to allow businesses to create a profile and send messages to their customers on WhatsApp. The founders also clashed with Facebook over building a mobile payments system on WhatsApp in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;Another point of disagreement was over WhatsApp’s encryption. In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption, a security feature that scrambles people’s messages so that outsiders, including WhatsApp’s owners, can’t read them. Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use its tools, and WhatsApp executives believed that doing so would require some weakening of its encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Ultimately, Koum was worn down by the differences in approach, the people said. Other WhatsApp employees are demoralized and plan to leave in November, four years and a month after the Facebook acquisition, when they are allowed to exercise all their stock options under the terms of the Facebook deal, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;Acton donated $50 million of his money to Signal, a rival messaging app that is geared toward security and privacy. In a recent blog post announcing his donation and role as the executive chairman of the nonprofit Signal Foundation, Acton said his goal was to build “the most trusted communications experience on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot; class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Julie Tate contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe Atlas for LLCs</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re adding support for creating a limited liability company (LLC) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been one of the most requested features from our users, and we’re excited to make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LLCs and C Corporations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Stripe Atlas as an easy way to create a Delaware C Corporation. They are the entity of choice for many investor-backed technology companies, but they’re not for everyone. LLCs, on the other hand, are used by many small teams, bootstrapped businesses, and side projects seeking a more flexible start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are continuous creation machines, running experiments and rearchitecting themselves on the fly. Legal choices often force startups to predict the future: is this a side project or the next Google? We think that some founders stop because they aren’t certain yet. So we sought to give founders more options to just get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Stripe Atlas LLC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders can now use Stripe Atlas to form an LLC in days. The Stripe Atlas LLC has the features common to LLCs: limited liability for founders and the flexibility to be taxed as an individual. But LLCs are used for everything from holding companies to restaurants, and we wanted the Stripe Atlas LLC templates to help meet the needs of technology startups. Orrick designed the Stripe Atlas legal documents to match the ways founders tell us they want to work. For example, the Stripe Atlas LLC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enables founders to assign relevant IP to the company at formation, formalizing ownership of key technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is designed to make conversion to a C Corporation as simple as possible. (We can connect Stripe Atlas users to a lawyer to manage the conversion process with discounted, flat-rate packages).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a simplified process for adding members after formation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is organized in Delaware, the jurisdiction of choice for many new LLCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the Stripe Atlas LLC—and tradeoffs between an LLC and C Corporation—&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp&quot;&gt;in this guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forming an LLC through Stripe Atlas will cost the same as a C Corporation: $500 gets you a new entity, tax ID, U.S. business bank account, Stripe account, access to expert tax and legal advice from our partners, tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-taxes&quot;&gt;handling taxes&lt;/a&gt;, and credits with a number of services. You’ll also join the Stripe Atlas Community, where you can connect with other founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/ama-marc-andreessen&quot;&gt;learn from experts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/saas-pricing&quot;&gt;get practical advice&lt;/a&gt;. We’re starting in beta, and folks who request an invite will hear back within a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, thousands of founders from over 130 countries—ranging from side projects to startups funded by Y Combinator—have used Stripe Atlas. We’ve been delighted by their progress, and can’t wait to see what you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cta&quot;&gt;Form an LLC with Stripe Atlas &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas#start-llc&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Request an invite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is a tool which creates PDF documents interactively using HTML or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt; (a shorthand for HTML). It allows complex layouts to be defined with CSS and JavaScript, while writing the content in a friendly, minimal syntax close to Markdown or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is in action in the Atom editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot; title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4N4fSYY.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed has support for Markdown, LaTeX-style mathematical equations (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathjax.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;), CSV conversion to HTML tables, plot generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chartjs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chart.js&lt;/a&gt;), and diagram generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaidjs.github.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;). Many more features can be added simply by importing an existing JavaScript or CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing ReLaXed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the best solution is to install ReLaXed in an empty directory as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed.git .
npm install
sudo npm link --unsafe-perm=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides your system with the &lt;code&gt;relaxed&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in the future, installation will be as simple as &lt;code&gt;npm i -g relaxedjs&lt;/code&gt;, but there are known &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/375#issuecomment-363466257&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; with Puppeteer. In case it doesn't work for you, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/wiki/Troubleshooting&quot;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; page. Any help towards a simpler installation procedure is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a project, create a new, empty &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; file, and start a ReLaXed process from a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;relaxed my_document.pug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed will watch &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; and its directory. Every time a file changes, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; will be compiled as &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now write and save the following in &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-jade&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
h1 My document's title
p A paragraph in my document
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new file, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;, will be created. Every time you modify and save the sources, the file is automatically updated (make sure you use a PDF viewer with auto-refresh to see your changes happen in &lt;em&gt;real-time&lt;/em&gt;). That's all there is to know to start creating your first document!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why yet another PDF document creator?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us prefer markup languages (Markdown, LaTeX, etc.) to GUI document-editors like MS Office or Google Docs. This is because markup languages make it easier to quickly write documents in a consistent style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Markdown is limited to the title/sections/paragraphs structure, and LaTeX has obscure syntax and errors that also make it difficult to stray from the beaten track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, web technologies have never looked so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beautiful CSS frameworks make sure your documents look clean and modern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are JavaScript libraries for pretty much anything: plotting, highlight code, rendering equations...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Millions of people (and growing) know how to use these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorthand languages like Pug and SCSS are finally making it fun to write HTML and CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Headless) web browsers can easily turn web documents into PDF, on any platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an attempt at finding the most comfortable way to leverage this for desktop PDF creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ReLaXed works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed consists of a few lines of code binding together other software. It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; to watch the file system. When a file is changed, several JavaScript libraries are used to compile SCSS, Pug, Markdown, and diagram files (mermaid, flowchart.js, Chart.js) into an HTML page which is then printed to a PDF file by a headless instance of Chromium (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contribute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an open-source framework originally written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko&quot;&gt;Zulko&lt;/a&gt; and released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko/relaxed&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; under the ISC licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb0 i&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Career Switchers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare for a career in cybersecurity, data analytics, or software development at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schankacademy.com&quot; class=&quot;tdu&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.rogerschank.com/lib/images/schank-academy-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Schank Academy Logo&quot; height=&quot;35&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schankacademy.com&quot; class=&quot;tdu&quot;&gt;Enroll today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They are not doing &quot;cognitive computing&quot; no matter how many times they say they are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with an old friend yesterday and he reminded me of a conversation we had nearly 50 years ago. I tried to explain to him what I did for living and he was trying to understand why getting computers to understand was more complicated than key word analysis. I explained about concepts underlying sentences and explained that sentences used words but that people really didn’t use words in their minds except to get to the underlying ideas and that computers were having a hard time with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, key words are still dominating the thoughts of people who try to get computers to deal with language. But, this time, the key word people have deceived the general public by making claims that this is thinking, that AI is here, and that, by the way we should be very afraid, or very excited, I forget which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were making some good progress on getting computers to understand language but, in 1984, AI winter started. AI winter was a result of too many promises about things AI could do that it really could not do. (This was about promoting expert systems. Where are they now?). Funding dried up and real work on natural language processing died too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still people promote key words because Google and others use it to do &quot;search&quot;. Search is all well and good when we are counting words, which is what data analytics and machine learning are really all about. Of course, once you count words you can do all kinds of correlations and users can learn about what words often connect to each other and make use of that information. But, users have learned to accommodate to Google not the other way around. We know what kinds of things we can type into Google and what we can’t and we keep our searches to things that Google is likely to help with. We know we are looking for texts and not answers to start a conversation with an entity that knows what we really need to talk about. People learn from conversation and Google can’t have one. It can pretend to have one using Siri but really those conversations tend to get tiresome when you are past asking about where to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I am not worried about Google. It works well enough for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am concerned about are the exaggerated claims being made by IBM about their Watson program. Recently they ran an ad featuring Bob Dylan which made laugh, or would have, if had made not me so angry. I will say it clearly: Watson is a fraud. I am not saying that it can’t crunch words, and there may well be value in that to some people. But the ads are fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something from Ad Week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer brags it can read 800 million pages per second, identifying key themes in Dylan's work, like &quot;time passes&quot; and &quot;love fades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're focusing on the advertising here, but this is really more than an advertising campaign,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;It's a point of view that IBM has, and it's going across all of our marketing, our internal communications, how we engage sellers and our employees. It's really across everything that we do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM says the latest series is meant to help a broader audience - companies, decision makers and software developers - better understand how Watson works. Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn. The company says industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and retail can all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin said Watson's abilities &quot;outthink&quot; human brains in areas where finding insights and connections can be difficult due to the abundance of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can outthink cancer, outthink risk, outthink doubt, outthink competitors if you embrace this idea of cognitive computing,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I am a child of the 60s’ and I remember Dylan’s songs well enough. Ask anyone from that era about Bob Dylan and no one will tell you his main theme was &quot;love fades&quot;. He was a protest singer, and a singer about the hard knocks of life. He was part of the anti-war movement. Love fades? That would be a dumb computer counting words. How would Watson see that many of Dylan’s songs were part of the anti-war movement? Does he say anti-war a lot? He probably never said it in a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-protest-songs/?trackback=tsmclip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our No. 1 Bob Dylan protest song, 'The Times They Are a-Changin,' Dylan went all out and combined the folk protest movement of the 1960's with the civil rights movement. The shorter verses piled upon one another in a powerful way, and lyrics like, &quot;There's a battle outside and it is ragin' / It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls / For the times they are a-changin',&quot; are iconic Dylan statements that manage to transcend the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he doesn't mention Viet Nam or Civil Rights. So Watson wouldn't know that he had anything to do with those issues. It is possible to talk about something and have the words themselves not be very telling. Background knowledge matters a lot. I asked a 20 something about Bob Dylan a few days ago and he had never heard of him. He didn’t know much about the 60’s. Neither does Watson. You can’t understand words if you don’t know their context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I told you that I heard a friend was buying a lot of sleeping pills and I was worried. Would Watson say I hear you are thinking about suicide? Would Watson suggest we hurry over and talk to our friend about their problems? Of course not. People understand in context because they know about the world and real issues in people's lives. They don't count words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is more from another site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5480984340045&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bob-dylan/&quot;&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylans-newport-folk-festival-guitar-discovered/&quot;&gt;father of folk music&lt;/a&gt; is probably overstepping a bit. However, saying that the vocalist is one of the most prominent writers of anti-war and protest songs in the 20th century is spot on, thus making him worthy of a Top 10 Bob Dylan Protest Songs list. The singer did change his range from anti-establishment to country to pop and back to folk again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-rolling-stones-among-most-collectible-records-of-all-time/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he remains a seminal force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those who rage against &quot;The Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was written by a human. How do I know? Because Watson can’t draw real conclusions by counting words in 800 million pages of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, what upsets me most is not Watson but what IBM actually says. From the quote above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Computer-Language-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/020106443X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1447943815&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=cognitive+computer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Cognitive Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 1984:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a company called Cognitive Systems in 1981. The things I was talking about then clearly have not been read by IBM (although they seem to like the words I used.) Watson is not reasoning. You can only reason if you have goals, plans, ways of attaining them, a comprehension of the beliefs that others may have, and a knowledge of past experiences to reason from. A point of view helps too. What is Watson’s view on ISIS for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumb question? Actual thinking entities have a point of view about ISIS. Dogs don’t but Watson isn't as smart as a dog either. (The dog knows how to get my attention for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invented a field called Case Based Reasoning in the 80’s which was meant to enable computers to compare new situations to old ones and then modify what the computer knew as a result. We were able to build some useful systems. And we learned a lot about human learning. Did I think we had created computers that were now going to outthink people or soon become conscious? Of course not. I thought we had begun to create computers that would be more useful to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if IBM would tone down the hype and let people know what Watson can actually do and stop making up nonsense about love fading and out thinking cancer. IBM is simply lying now and they need to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI winter is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter also sold data access to Cambridge Analytica researcher</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/twitter-also-sold-data-access-to-cambridge-analytica-researcher/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/twitter-also-sold-data-access-to-cambridge-analytica-researcher/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since it was revealed that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/&quot;&gt;improperly accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users&lt;/a&gt;, one question has lingered in the minds of the public: What other &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;data-4&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; did Dr. Aleksandr Kogan gain access to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/twitter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; confirmed to The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/04/28/twitter-caught-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal/&quot;&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that GSR, Kogan’s own commercial enterprise, had purchased one-time API access to a random sample of public tweets from a five-month period between December 2014 and April 2015. Twitter told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-29/twitter-sold-cambridge-analytica-researcher-public-data-access&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; that, following an internal review, the company did not find any access to private data about people who use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter sells API access to large organizations or enterprises for the purposes of surveying sentiment or opinion during various events, or around certain topics or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a Twitter spokesperson said to The Telegraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has also made the policy decision to off-board advertising from all accounts owned and operated by Cambridge Analytica. This decision is based on our determination that Cambridge Analytica operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices. Cambridge Analytica may remain an organic user on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this doesn’t have the same scope as the data harvested about users on Facebook. Twitter’s data on users is far less personal. Location on the platform is opt-in and generic at that, and users are not forced to use their real name on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica tweeted out this morning that the data obtained by Kogan/GSR from Twitter was never purchased or used by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.0939597315436&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.8926174496644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aleksandr-kogan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;aleksandr-kogan&quot;&gt;Aleksandr Kogan,&lt;/a&gt; and has never done any work with GSR on Twitter data. GSR was only ever a contractor to Cambridge Analytica and we understand it did work for many other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CamAnalytica/status/990959309231132672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Twitter and will update when we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to speed up the Rust compiler in 2018</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;18 months ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2016/10/14/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler/&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2016/11/23/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more/&quot;&gt;some work&lt;/a&gt; I did to speed up the Rust compiler (rustc). I’ve recently taken this work up again. Also, in the meantime rustc’s build system has been replaced and its benchmark suite has been overhauled. So it’s a good time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps for getting the rustc code haven’t changed. First, I fork the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/&quot;&gt;main Rust repository&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. Then I make two local clones: a base clone that I won’t modify, which serves as a stable comparison point (rust0), and a second clone where I make my modifications (rust1). I use commands something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
user=nnethercote
for r in rust0 rust1 ; do
  git clone https://github.com/$user/rust $r
  cd $r
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:$user/rust
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building the Rust compiler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiler’s build system is &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.rust-lang.org/x-py.html&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; with many possible invocations and configurations. I’ll cover the absolute minimum information required to understand how I’ve been using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need a &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file, which sits at the root of the repository and dictates the compiler’s configuration. I used the provided &lt;code&gt;config.toml.example&lt;/code&gt; as a starting point, cut it down a lot, and ended up with the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[llvm]
optimize = true
release-debuginfo = true
assertions = false

[rust]
optimize = true
codegen-units = 1
debug-assertions = false
debuginfo = true
debuginfo-lines = true
use-jemalloc = false
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that some of these lines just restate defaults, but I figure it doesn’t hurt to be explicit. This configuration has the following characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It results in the production of a fully optimized rustc, which is important for profiling. The exception to this is that I disable jemalloc, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html&quot;&gt;DHAT&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t work when jemalloc is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has maximal debug info present, which ensures that profiles are as detailed as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building rustc can be confusing, particularly because of the multiple compiler stages and the terminology around them. Here is the command I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
./x.py build --stage 2 src/rustc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces a stage 2 compiler that can handle procedural macros and so is suitable for profiling the benchmark suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The benchmark suite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rustc’s benchmark suite is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf&quot;&gt;rustc-perf&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;collector: The 24 benchmark programs, 14 of which are “real” code (i.e. crates used in real applications), and 10 of which are toy programs or stress test microbenchmarks. Also, the harness code that runs and measures them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;site: Code for displaying measurements as a website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test harness is very thorough. For each benchmark, it measures Debug, Opt, and Check (no code generation) invocations. Furthermore, within each of those categories, it does five or more runs, including a normal build and various kinds of incremental builds. A full benchmarking run measures over 400 invocations of rustc. Note however that only the compilation of the final crate is measured in each benchmark; compilation of dependent crates is not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rustc-perf was created primarily for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://perf.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;perf.rust-lang.org&lt;/a&gt; site, which tracks rustc’s performance over time. I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/pull/207&quot;&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt; it so it could be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector&quot;&gt;compare two builds of rustc on a local machine&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fundamental operation when optimizing. This can be done by running the suite and site locally and navigating to the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html&quot;&gt;“compare” page&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/04/30/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018/compare/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3176&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3176&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of rustc-perf's compare page&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height=&quot;526&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare.png 667w, https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare-252x199.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2018/04/compare-600x473.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that rustc-perf uses perf-stat for its measurements, so the benchmarking functionality currently only works on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/pull/209&quot;&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; rustc-perf so the benchmarks can be run under a profiler. I implemented support for perf-record, Cachegrind, and DHAT, because they are the profilers that I am most familiar with; it isn’t hard to add support for other profilers (including non-Linux ones). The advantage of integrating support for a profiler intto rustc-perf is that it gets the profiler invocations underneath the Cargo invocations, ensuring that the right rustc invocations are measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the improvements I’ve made to rustc over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49993&quot;&gt;#49993&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that derived methods for the &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; type were taking up significant time. This PR changed the ‘#’ counts in raw &lt;code&gt;Lit&lt;/code&gt; variants from &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt;, which reduced the size of &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; from 32 to 24 bytes, speeding up some of the runs for coercions and html5ever by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50051&quot;&gt;#50051&lt;/a&gt;: Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Option::ok_or&lt;/code&gt; function transforms an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; value into a &lt;code&gt;Result&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a bit of a footgun… as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or&quot;&gt;docs say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments passed to &lt;code&gt;ok_or&lt;/code&gt; are eagerly evaluated; if you are passing the result of a function call, it is recommended to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or_else&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ok_or_else&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is lazily evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAT’s output showed that one hot allocation site involved the creation of a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; while getting the value of the &lt;code&gt;MIRI_BACKTRACE&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. This seemed to me like a strange thing to be happening frequently, and it turns out that it was at the end of a chain of calls that were only needed in the (rare) error case of an &lt;code&gt;ok_or&lt;/code&gt; call. This PR changed the code to use a trivial closure with &lt;code&gt;ok_or_else&lt;/code&gt;, speeding up runs for a lot of benchmarks, the best by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50052&quot;&gt;#50052&lt;/a&gt;: DHAT’s output showed that the &lt;code&gt;char_lit&lt;/code&gt; function, which parses “\u{…}” literals, was doing a lot of allocations while stripping out ‘_’ chars. This PR avoided that allocation, speeding up various runs — particularly ones for regex, futures, clap, coercions, hyper, and encoding — the best by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50106&quot;&gt;#50106&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that the &lt;code&gt;nearest_common_ancestor&lt;/code&gt; function, which computes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor&quot;&gt;lowest common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of two nodes in a scope tree, was very hot. The algorithm in use constructed the full scope chain for each node, and then worked backward from the end of the two scope chains until a difference was found. This is a reasonable algorithm in many circumstances, but some ad hoc instrumentation (&lt;code&gt;eprintln!&lt;/code&gt; statements plus some simple post-processing) showed that the scope chains usually only differ by a handful of elements at the front and then have very long common tails, with dozens or even hundreds of elements. This PR switched to a different algorithm that looks for differences from the front of the scope chain, speeding up runs for many benchmarks, the best by 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50174&quot;&gt;#50174&lt;/a&gt;: By default, Rust’s &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; use a hash function that is very high quality but also very slow. Therefore, the Rust compiler internally uses different types, &lt;code&gt;FxHashSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FxHashMap&lt;/code&gt;, which are identical to the standard ones except they use a much faster hash function. Unfortunately, it’s easy to forget about them and use the standard hash tables instead. Cachegrind’s output showed that the default hash function code (SipHash) was executed a lot, and that one particularly hot hash table (the symbol interner) was using &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;. This PR (trivially) changed that table to an &lt;code&gt;FxHashMap&lt;/code&gt;, speeding up runs for numerous benchmarks, the best by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50240&quot;&gt;#50240&lt;/a&gt;: Some of Rust’s standard containers, such as &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;, have the nice property that by default they don’t allocate until an element is inserted. This is good because it’s surprising how often such containers are created but never inserted into. DHAT’s output showed that such behaviour would also help with a couple of the compiler’s uses of BTreeMap. I tried and failed to implement this behaviour directly in BTreeMap; according to Gankro, “BTreeMap is some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7f3444e1baf0d335b4bf379f845dbc28cdd0509c/src/liballoc/btree/node.rs#L257-L280&quot;&gt;most complex unsafe code in libstd” &lt;/a&gt;and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gankro/status/989683166658121728&quot;&gt;I just scared off a grizzled firefox dev explaining it&lt;/a&gt;“! Instead this PR introduced a thin wrapper type (&lt;code&gt;LazyBTreeMap)&lt;/code&gt; around &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; and used it in the handful of relevant places within the compiler, speeding up the runs for several benchmarks, the best by 3%. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50266&quot;&gt;#50266&lt;/a&gt; is open to do the general fix for &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt;, whereupon &lt;code&gt;LazyBTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; will be able to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50246&quot;&gt;#50246&lt;/a&gt;: Cachegrind’s output showed that a function named &lt;code&gt;dump_allocs&lt;/code&gt; was hot for some benchmarks. This sounded to me like a logging or debugging function of some kind, and investigation confirmed that it was traversing data structures in order to build up strings that went unused in the standard case where logging is disabled. This PR (trivially) changed this function and a couple of related ones to be no-ops if logging is disabled, speeding up runs for coercions, tuple-stress, html5ever, and encoding, the best by almost 15%! This shows how &lt;em&gt;not doing unclever things&lt;/em&gt; is often as important as &lt;em&gt;doing clever things&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to optimizing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s worth noting that I also made three or four optimization attempts that didn’t work out — where I made a change that seemed like it should help, based on profiling data, but the effect was negligible. Success isn’t guaranteed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the PRs mentioned above (except for the aborted &lt;code&gt;BTreeMap&lt;/code&gt; change) involved small, simple changes to the Rust compiler’s code. I’m not a rustc expert, but I do know how to use a couple of profilers well, and I’ve been able to make a difference. I’m sure there are more improvements of this nature to be made, and I encourage other people to try profiling rustc with their favourite profilers to see what they can find. This is valuable because rustc’s speed is something that Rust users often complain about. And it’s fun, if you like that sort of thing 🙂  I’m happy to help people, and the members of the #rustc IRC channel are very friendly and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, in a lot of cases, especially for opt builds, the majority of execution time is within LLVM, which rustc uses for code generation. Speeding up LLVM itself may be difficult, but I hope/suspect there is room for improvement in the way that rustc interacts with LLVM. If anyone has ideas on that front I’d love to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A home-made lithographically-fabricated integrated circuit</title>
<link>http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/#</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to announce the details of my first integrated circuit and share the journey that this project has taken me on over the past year. I hope that my success will inspire others and help start a revolution in home chip fabrication. When I set out on this project I had no idea of what I had gotten myself into, but in the end I learned more than I ever thought I would about physics, chemistry, optics, electronics, and so many other fields. Furthermore, my efforts have only been matched with the most positive feedback and support from the world; I owe a sincere thanks to everyone who has helped me, given me advice, and inspired me on this project. Especially my amazing parents, who not only support and encourage me in any way they can but also give me a space to work in and put up with the electricity costs… Thank you!&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737&quot; src=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-1024x678.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_D7V8343&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; srcset=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-1024x678.jpg 1024w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-300x199.jpg 300w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8343-768x509.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I present the first home(garage)made lithographically-fabricated integrated circuit – the “Z1” PMOS dual differential amplifier chip. I say “lithographically-fabricated” because Jeri Ellsworth made the first transistors and logic gates (meticulously hand wired with conductive epoxy) and showed the world that this is possible. Inspired by her work, I have demonstrated ICs made by a scalable, industry-standard, photolithographic process. Needless to say, this is the logical step-up from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/fet/&quot;&gt;previous replication of Jeri’s FET fabrication work. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/ic-design-tools-from-verilog-to-mask/&quot;&gt;I designed the Z1 amplifier&lt;/a&gt; looking for a simple chip to test and tweak my process. Layout was done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/&quot;&gt;Magic VLSI&lt;/a&gt; for a 4 mask PMOS process (active/doped area, gate oxide, contact window, and top metal.) PMOS has advantages over NMOS as far as mobile ionic contamination that lends it to being fabricated in a garage. The masks are designed in 16:9 aspect ratio for easy projection.&lt;/p&gt;

Metal&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature (gate) size is approximately 175μm although there are test features as small as 2μm on the chip. Each amplifier section (center and right) contain 3 transistors (2 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_amplifier&quot;&gt;long-tailed differential pair&lt;/a&gt; and one as current source/load resistor) which means a total of 6 FETs on the IC. The left portion of the IC contains resistors, capacitors, diodes, and other test features used to characterize the fabrication process. Each node of the differential pairs is broken out to a separate pin on the lead frame so it can be analyzed and external biasing can be added as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fabrication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 66 individual fabrication steps to make this chip and it takes approximately 12 hours for a full run. The process yield can be as high as 80% for these large features, but is largely dependent on my coffee intake that day. I have also made Youtube videos covering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCSIGejNT4M&amp;amp;t=1808s&quot;&gt;semiconductor fabrication theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1MCi7FliVY&quot;&gt;discrete MOSFET fabrication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50mm (2″) Si wafers are scored into 5.08 x 3.175mm dies (~16mm^2 area) with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/laser-silicon-wafer-scribing-and-cutting/&quot;&gt;Epilog fiber laser.&lt;/a&gt; This die size is chosen to fit into a Kyocera 24pin DIP carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native oxide is stripped off the wafer with a quick dilute HF dip and then they are extensively cleaned in Piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2), RCA 1 (H2O:NH3:H2O2), RCA 2 (H2O:HCL:H2O2), followed by another dilute HF dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field oxide is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleanroom.byu.edu/OxideTimeCalc&quot;&gt;thermally grown&lt;/a&gt; in a water vapor ambient (wet oxidation) to a thickness of 5000-8000Å.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resist pattern is then hard baked and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/sio2-patterning/&quot;&gt;number of other tricks&lt;/a&gt; are used to ensure good resist adhesion and chemical stability during the following HF etch step which transfers that pattern to the oxide layer and opens windows to the bare silicon surface for doping. These regions later become the source/drain of the FETs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-icon landscape&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8361-e1524952474139.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; src=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8361-e1524952474139-1024x765.jpg&quot; class=&quot;attachment-large size-large&quot; alt=&quot;Doped dies w/ gate etch&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;gallery-6-1768&quot; srcset=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8361-e1524952474139-1024x765.jpg 1024w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8361-e1524952474139-300x224.jpg 300w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8361-e1524952474139-768x574.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Doped dies w/ gate etch&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping is then carried out by either solid or liquid source. The solid source is a Boron Nitride disk that is placed in proximity (&amp;lt;2mm) from the wafer in the tube furnace. Alternatively, spin-on liquid sources can be prepared from Phosphoric or Boric acid in water or solvents and doping is carried out in a standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://desertsilicon.com/spin-on-glass-spin-on-dopants-application-procedure/&quot;&gt;pre-deposition/HF dip/drive-in/deglaze process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above mentioned patterning steps are then repeated twice for the gate oxide layer and then the contact layer. The gate oxide must be much thinner (&amp;lt;~750Å) than the field oxide, so the regions between the source/drain are etched away and a thinner oxide is grown there. Then, since the whole wafer has been oxidized during the doping step, contact windows must be etched for the metal layer to make connection with source/drain doped regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1764&quot; src=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;na_1&quot; width=&quot;422&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; srcset=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1.png 422w, http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/na_1-300x136.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all the transistors are formed and are ready to be interconnected and broken out to the lead frame. A blanket layer of Aluminum (400-500nm) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/sem-sample-preparation-dc-sputtering/&quot;&gt;sputtered&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/thermal-evaporation-physical-vapor-deposition/&quot;&gt;thermally evaporated&lt;/a&gt; onto the wafer. An alternative would be to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/lift-off-metal-patterning/&quot;&gt;lift-off process&lt;/a&gt; in which the photoresist is patterned first and then metal is deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

Evaporated metal&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal layer is then patterned with photolithography and etched in hot Phosphoric acid to yield the completed IC. The final steps before testing are visual inspection and high temperature annealing of the Aluminum to create ohmic connections.&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/D7V8327.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished chip is now ready for packaging and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a wire bonder (accepting donations!) so my testing right now is limited to manually probing the wafer with sharp tweezers or using a flip-chip board (difficult to align) to connect it to a curve tracer. The differential amplifier is also tested empirically in-circuit to verify operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/D7V6896-768x509.jpg&quot;&gt;FET Ids/Vds curve from previous NMOS device&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these curves are far from ideal (some of which is due to extra contact resistance/other factors like that) but I would expect things to get better with proper wire bonding. This may also account for some of the die to die variation. This page will be updated with new IV, FET, and a differential amplifier characteristic curves soon.&lt;/p&gt;
