<title>1060-hour image of the Large Magellanic Cloud captured by amateur astronomers</title>

<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1060 is the number of hours&lt;/strong&gt; needed to capture this highly-resolved image (204 Megapixels) of the Large Magellanic Cloud. It might be the &lt;strong&gt;world's longest exposure image within the amateur astronomers community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In astrophotography, the amount of time you spend imaging a celestial object is inherently fundamental. The l&lt;strong&gt;onger your camera's shutter is open, the more light you get&lt;/strong&gt;, so that the darkest regions of the sky start to get clearer. Usually, amateur astronomers are familiar with very long integration times, such as few minutes or even few tens of hours. However, reaching a total amount of several hundred hours increases the complexity of image processing and therefore remains quiet rare... though, &lt;strong&gt;five keen amateur astrophotographers&lt;/strong&gt; challenged themselves and decided to &lt;strong&gt;capture a picture of 1060 hours of total exposure time&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be &lt;strong&gt;considered as a world record&lt;/strong&gt; (professional astronomy excluded).&lt;p&gt;This image is not only a technical accomplishment, but &lt;strong&gt;brings also a scientific interest&lt;/strong&gt; to one of the most amazing deep sky object of the Southern sky : &lt;strong&gt;The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;★ A Team of amateur astronomers behind this feat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The image is a mosaic made of &lt;strong&gt;16 smaller fields of view&lt;/strong&gt;, which, once stitched together form a &lt;strong&gt;high-resolution image of 204 Million of pixels&lt;/strong&gt;! As of matter of fact, this is not the work of a single person but by a &lt;strong&gt;team of five french amateur astronomers called &quot;Ciel Austral&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;em&gt;Jean Claude CANONNE, Philippe BERNHARD, Didier CHAPLAIN, Nicolas OUTTERS et Laurent BOURGON&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&quot;Ciel Austral&quot; owns a remotely-controlled observatory located in the most prestigious skies of the planet, &lt;strong&gt;in Chile&lt;/strong&gt;, and more precisely at the El Sauce Observatory (Coquimbo Region). A 160-mm APO-refractor telescope and a Moravian CCD were used to obtain this wonderful field. The datasets were &lt;strong&gt;taken over several months,&lt;/strong&gt; ranging from 2018 and 2019. The heavy files handled represent &lt;strong&gt;620 GB&lt;/strong&gt; and needed few hundreds of hours to get out of the image processing step! Once stacked together, they make up the stunning figure of 1060 hours of exposure. If you are more curious, we invite you having a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cielaustral.com/galerie/photo95.htm?fbclid=IwAR3GMt0zg_9VrcXH3moy7-lR7stH2Gb-ZOYPpvpTKMZooK7LpMBa97PQx2Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their official website here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You certainly noticed the color-rendering of this image is quite unusual. Indeed, astrophotographers used a couple of &lt;strong&gt;special filters&lt;/strong&gt; which transmit narrow parts -lines- of the visible spectrum : the &lt;strong&gt;Hydrogen Alpha&lt;/strong&gt; line at 656 nm, the &lt;strong&gt;Sulfur&lt;/strong&gt; line at 672 nm and the &lt;strong&gt;Oxygen III&lt;/strong&gt; spectral line at 500 nm. These kind of filters enable to &lt;strong&gt;emphasize chemical components located in high-density gas regions like nebulae&lt;/strong&gt;, what standard RGB imaging can not perform.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Settled in Chile since 2017, the Ciel Austral Observatory gives to this 5-member team a way to expanding their knowledge and skills in astronomical imagery in order to fulfill its most ambitious projects. So, one should stay tuned for more of their upcoming fantastic images.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;★ The Large Magellanic Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This image shows us a unique view of the most famous night-sky object for Southern-Hemisphere astronomy. The LMC is actually a &lt;strong&gt;satellite neighbor&lt;/strong&gt; of our Milky Way galaxy pretty close to us, at 50 kilo-parsecs distance (163k light-years). Scientists estimate it will do a full orbit around us in only 1.5 Billion years...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The Large Magellanic Cloud belongs to the Local Group - a list of about 50 galaxies close to each other, including our own. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to spend a night under the Southern Skies, this naked-eye-visible object will surprise you by its &lt;strong&gt;wide angular size and its strong brightness&lt;/strong&gt;: LMC covers a slice of the sky which can contain &lt;strong&gt;20 moon diameters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;shining at a 0.9 magnitude&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Want to learn a new skill? Take some short breaks</title>
<link>https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/News-and-Press-Releases/Press-Releases/Want-learn-new-skill-Take-some-short-breaks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/News-and-Press-Releases/Press-Releases/Want-learn-new-skill-Take-some-short-breaks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NIH study suggests our brains may use short rest periods to strengthen memories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of healthy volunteers, National Institutes of Health researchers found that our brains may solidify the memories of new skills we just practiced a few seconds earlier by taking a short rest. The results highlight the critically important role rest may play in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone thinks you need to ‘practice, practice, practice’ when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, may be just as critical to learning as practice,” said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a senior author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology. “Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to ‘relearn’ lost skills.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Marlene Bönstrup, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen’s lab. Like many scientists, she held the general belief that our brains needed long periods of rest, such as a good night’s sleep, to strengthen the memories formed while practicing a newly learned skill. But after looking at brain waves recorded from healthy volunteers in learning and memory experiments at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;, she started to question the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waves were recorded from right-handed volunteers with a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography. The subjects sat in a chair facing a computer screen and under a long cone-shaped brain scanning cap. The experiment began when they were shown a series of numbers on a screen and asked to type the numbers as many times as possible with their left hands for 10 seconds; take a 10 second break; and then repeat this trial cycle of alternating practice and rest 35 more times. This strategy is typically used to reduce any complications that could arise from fatigue or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, the volunteers’ speed at which they correctly typed the numbers improved dramatically during the first few trials and then leveled off around the 11th cycle. When Dr. Bönstrup looked at the volunteers’ brain waves she observed something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that participants’ brain waves seemed to change much more during the rest periods than during the typing sessions,” said Dr. Bönstrup. “This gave me the idea to look much more closely for when learning was actually happening. Was it during practice or rest?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers’ performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers’ brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers’ brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,” said Dr. Cohen. “Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cohen’s team plans to explore, in greater detail, the role of these early resting periods in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Icons: Avoid temptation and start with user needs</title>
<link>https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/icons-avoid-temptation-and-start-with-user-needs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/icons-avoid-temptation-and-start-with-user-needs</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Icons represent ideas in a simple, visual way. But we must use them carefully, and only where they help people. Users’ needs must come first, and we shouldn’t be afraid to challenge how people use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm an interaction designer working in the team which redesigned the NHS website, previously NHS Choices. Over the years the site had developed lots of different navigation patterns and image styles to address the same user need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning a new language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to throw a few icons on a page. But there are very few that everyone recognises. These include the icons for home, print, and search (the magnifying glass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting a user to understand a non-universal icon is like expecting them to learn a new language. And we know that most people don’t want to or can’t learn new languages easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, icons have their advantages. If they’re quickly recognised, they can be good targets for fingers and mouse cursors and they can overcome language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An icon for every occasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/icons-on-the-nhs-website-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Examples of the various icons on the NHS Choices website&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lack of consistency on the website – there were more than 30 icons, used as navigation, decoration and buttons. Our first task was to audit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what icons existed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what user needs they met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether users understood them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether they were essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether they were accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at the icons’ file formats, styles, sizes, colours and shapes. We also checked if there was any way of measuring their effectiveness with analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We evaluated the 30 icons against two criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;meeting specific user needs or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being essential to the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and reduced the number to 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A set of icons for the NHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided if we were to use icons, they needed to look like they were from the same family. The NHS brand is well established and based on trust, with its distinct blue colour and Frutiger font. We had to be careful about introducing new elements. Rather than using free icons, we decided to create our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had proved through testing that buttons with rounded corners looked more ‘clicky’, so we styled our icons similarly. Our assumption was that icons with rounded corners would stand out among elements such as the NHS logo, which are quite angular and boxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions and testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hamburger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHS Choices used a ‘hamburger’ icon to toggle the menu (the main navigation) but, while hamburgers are used on a lot of websites and apps, they aren’t universally understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/nhs-choices-hamburger-icon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NHS Choices hamburger menu icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the new site, the menu link needed to sit in the new header alongside the NHS logo and search link. If we used the hamburger icon, we also needed a supporting label to be accessible (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation).&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation).');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;see Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.3.3)&lt;/a&gt;. But then we lost the benefits of being simple and visually pleasing. The extra clutter would make it harder for users to scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Menu’ is a simple word and it didn’t fight with the NHS branding. We took it out to test with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that they had no problem navigating to the correct information via the menu and that their interpretation of the word ‘menu’ fits our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/new-nhs-website-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;The new NHS website header&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of our new navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclamation or question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exclamation marks and information icons had been used on the website’s health information pages to help users identify warnings and important content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took some new versions out to test with users in a shopping centre. To our astonishment, a number of users said that they wouldn’t read the information in the boxes. They likened them to advertising on news sites and overlooked them because of the ambiguity of the icon and the ‘READ ME!!!’ look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/infected-blister-smaller-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of warning call out with exclamation icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/vertigo-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of inset text with an i icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found the exclamation icon caused more harm than good. Users who read the boxes misunderstood their importance. Some thought on first glance that the information was more important than emergency ‘call 999’ messaging, which it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we replaced the exclamation with the word ‘important’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/important-blister-even-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of warning callout with the heading of important&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we retested, having ‘Important’ worked for warnings. Users read the information and understood its importance. We’ve since added context-specific, short headings which also test well with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the information icon was also effective. The blue left border worked well in highlighting information without making it appear more important than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/vertigo2-even-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of inset text without icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all icons are bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we found words more effective on certain components, some icons work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do and Don’t lists have proved to reassure users. The tick and cross icons support the positive and negative statements and highlight information when users scan a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/dos-and-donts-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of do and don’t list&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found arrow icons highlight ‘action’ links for users wanting to find help. They're noticeable but, unlike buttons, users actually read the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/minor-injuries-unit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of action link&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A final set of NHS icons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of lab testing and pop-up sessions we ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/icons&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/icons');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;a set of 11 icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/final-set-of-icons-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the final set of 11 NHS icons&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re a great start but it's important to remember that they were tested in specific contexts for specific needs. You should only add icons if research shows there’s something missing. Underpin everything with user research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the icons available in the NHS.UK frontend library in a health context, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:service-manual@nhs.net&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','mailto:service-manual@nhs.net');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;please feedback&lt;/a&gt; on how they’re working.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Learn TLA+ (2018)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://learntla.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-tla&quot;&gt;What is TLA+?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLA+ is a &lt;em&gt;formal specification language&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a tool to design systems and algorithms, then programmatically verify that those systems don’t have critical bugs. It’s the software equivalent of a blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-i-use-it&quot;&gt;Why should I use it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple TLA+ specification, representing people trading unique items. Can you find the bug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-tla&quot; data-lang=&quot;tla&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;People&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;alice&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;bob&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;ore&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;sheep&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;brick&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;(* --algorithm trade&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner_of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;[Items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;giveitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\* up to three possible trades made&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Items,&lt;/span&gt; 
          &lt;span&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner_of[item],&lt;/span&gt; 
          &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;origin_of_trade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Give:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;origin_of_trade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span&gt;owner_of[item]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;end process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;end algorithm; *)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we check that the owner of an item is the one trading it away, we should be safe against scams, right? But if we run the model checker, we find that’s not true: Alice could trade an item to &lt;em&gt;herself&lt;/em&gt; and, before that process finishes running, resolve a parallel trade giving that same item to Bob. Then the first trade resolves and Alice gets the item back. Our algorithm fails for race conditions, and we know this because TLA+ explored every possible state and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few different ways of fixing this. But does our fix work for more than two people? In TLA+, checking that is as simple as &lt;code&gt;People == {&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;eve&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;. Does it work if we can trade multiple items at once? &lt;code&gt;variable items \in SUBSET Items&lt;/code&gt;. What about if there’s multiple sheep, ore, and bricks? &lt;code&gt;amount_owned = [People \X Items -&amp;gt; 0..5]&lt;/code&gt;. What if three people are all trading 1 ore and 1 sheep with each of the other players while Eve also trades Alice 0 brick? If it’s in the possible state space, TLA+ will check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-it-hard-to-use&quot;&gt;Is it hard to use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal methods have a reputation for being difficult to the point where they’re only worth it for critical systems. This means that all of the guides are written under the assumption that the reader is working on a critical system, where they have to know TLA+ inside and out to make absolutely sure that their system won’t accidentally &lt;em&gt;kill people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dangerous bug to you is “somebody dies”, then yes, formal methods are hard. If a dangerous bug to you is “nobody dies but our customers get really mad and we have to spend two weeks tracking down and fixing the bug”, then the small subset of TLA+ you’ll need is actually pretty easy to learn. Just find a beginner-friendly guide and you’re all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-s-a-beginner-friendly-guide&quot;&gt;Where’s a beginner-friendly guide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! This guide covers the basics of TLA+ in an easy, hands-on way. If you want to start from the beginning, you can learn more about what we’ll cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntla.com/introduction/about-this-guide&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Org-mode parser in Rust</title>
<link>https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt; parser re-write in Rust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! Warning, this project is in early development !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best and most complete plain text organizational system known to mankind. It has countless applications like authoring, publishing, task and time tracking, journal, blog, agenda, wiki etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Org was originally developed for Emacs and therefore available only inside Emacs. It is a huge limiting factor for Org's development and popularization. Because of that it is not as popular outside of Emacs community as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many attempts were made to fix this. It all starts with a parser. But because Org's syntax is not trivial and in fact most of it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-1_grammars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;context-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; with only a few context-free elements, it is quite easy to get it wrong. Some Org parsers have chosen to focus on a restricted subset of Org's syntax like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby&quot;&gt;org-ruby&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. More ambitious project try to cover all features but since Org does not have a formal specification&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; they rely on observed Org's behavior in Emacs or author's intuition. As a result they rarely get finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the absence of a good a spec and the complexity of the grammar are not show stoppers. Why reinventing the wheel when we can just copy it! This project takes the only surefire way to get it right - use the original elisp parser implementation as a blueprint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be fast. Speed matters. Period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be feature-complete, compliant with original implementation. Nobody wants Nth competing standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be standalone, embeddable and reusable. User must not be locked into one particular editor or ecosystem. Integrations with language servers, editors and plugins should be encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the choices that were made to achieve the goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust. Because it is fast, memory safe and provides C FFI. And most importantly it is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rope&lt;/a&gt; as underlying data structure that provides O(log n) updates. &lt;a href=&quot;http://abishov.com/xi-editor/docs/rope_science_00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xi-rope&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome implementation from xi-editor project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original elisp algorithm. While using the original elisp source as a guideline might result in less idiomatic Rust code it has its advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope of work is well-defined and finish line is visible. This should encourage contributions even from people who want to get started with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting &quot;feature-complete&quot; is just a matter of getting to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs/blob/master/rust/element&quot;&gt;element&lt;/a&gt; - parser crate is currently the main and only focus. It should perform just 2 tasks. Generate concrete syntax tree and serialize it back to canonical Org representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the roadmap is not fully flashed out. Feature-complete parser opens a lot of possibilities, here are just a few of my ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parse tree manipulation tools (like exporting to other formats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language server - &lt;a href=&quot;https://langserver.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a way to solve &quot;the matrix&quot; problem&lt;/a&gt;. Enabling other editors to have their own org-mode would be a logical next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLI tools. I'd love to get integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior&quot;&gt;TaskWarrior&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even use Org as TaskWarrior's DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any contributions are welcome. If you want to help check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Footnote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some attempts were made to formalize the syntax. This project uses them as supplementary materials. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Which programming language is used for making Windows 10?</title>
<link>https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Windows 10 is the same (evolved) code base as the code base of Windows 8.x, 7, Vista, XP, 2000, and NT, where each generation saw significant refactoring, and added substantial new features, improved performance and hardware support as well as security, all while maintaining a very high degree of backward compatibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Most of the kernel (ntoskrnl.exe) is written in the C programming language. You can find leaked copies of the Windows Research Kernel even on Github&lt;a id=&quot;cite-iRMiY&quot; href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1#iRMiY&quot; class=&quot;citation_link&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself: although quite dated and largely incomplete, this code should give significant insights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;See for example the source code that implements the familiar Registry, a kernel component known internally as the configuration manager, “Cm”, in &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2?files=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;wrk-v1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2/tree/master/base&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2/tree/master/base/ntos&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;ntos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;config&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Most of what runs in kernel mode is also written in the C programming language (most file systems, networking, most drivers…) with some C++ here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;As you go up the stack towards user mode, and towards more recent developments, you’ll find somewhat less C and somewhat more C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;As a side note, what most people don’t realize is the sheer size of Windows: this is a gigantic project of truly epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The full source tree with all the code, test code and everything that together constitutes the “Windows source code” is more than a half terabyte in size, in more than 4 million files. You can spend a year (seriously) just drilling down the source tree, more than a half million folders containing the code for every component making up the OS workstation and server products and all their editions, tools, and associated developement kits, and see what’s in there, read the file names and try to figure out what does what. It would take a life (or two) to read it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Below is a screenshot which may or may not depict statistics about a full Windows enlistment (source code, test files, build tools, everything)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-be4162100bd9e3ed8411bbd6cff8b9e1&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3155a0ab149196c65a933ea28b0f320b&quot; master_w=&quot;664&quot; master_h=&quot;216&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;One one occasion, I left a Git branch stall for a few weeks and, when I got back to it, it was behind by almost 60,000 commits. I think one can argue that a single person cannot possibly read all the code that is added to Windows every day, let alone read what was written during the past thirty years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Back to our topic, if you look at a Windows 10 “DVD” and consider what programming languages were used to create everything that’s on that disk, my guess is that 98% of it would be C and C++, with C getting the lion’s share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The .NET BCL and other managed libraries &amp;amp; frameworks that ship inbox are typically written in C#, but they only represent tiny drops in a giant sea of C code with a few islands of C++. They also come from a different division (the developper’s division, DevDiv) and their code is not part of the Windows source tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;qtext_citation_lead&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;citation&quot; id=&quot;iRMiY&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1#cite-iRMiY&quot; class=&quot;citation_index&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;markjandrews/wrk-v1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Is a Manifold?</title>
<link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/manifold/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/manifold/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In machine learning, the term &lt;em&gt;manifold&lt;/em&gt; is thrown around a lot—in fact, there’s even a branch of machine learning dealing with learning the structure of manifolds. Said branch is aptly named &lt;em&gt;manifold learning&lt;/em&gt;. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://christian.bock.ml/posts/significant_shapelets/&quot;&gt;fantastic visualizations of shapelet mining algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, this post aims to give a visual introduction to manifolds that is accessible for non-mathematicians and mathematicians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a rough definition: a $d$-dimensional manifold is something that &lt;em&gt;locally looks&lt;/em&gt; like a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. like some $\mathbb{R}^d$. To show that this is less complicated than it sounds, we need to build some intuition by providing examples. First of all, when mathematicians say that something ‘locally looks’ like something else, they consider viewing that object from the perspective of an extremely tiny bug that ‘lives’ on said object (and cannot move away from it—but more about that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the definition above a $1$-dimensional manifold would thus be something that ‘locally looks’ like $\mathbb{R}^1$. But it turns out that we know $\mathbb{R}^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$ rather well: it is nothing but the line of real numbers. This is how it looks from the ‘outside’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_number_line.svg&quot; alt=&quot;The real number line in all its glory&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real number line in all its glory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how it looks from the perspective of a small bug ‘living’ on said line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, from the perspective of the bug, the line stretches onwards to infinity, i.e. &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; your screen, without having any other extents. In fact, the bug can only move ‘forward’ and ‘backward’, as there are no other directions. The number line is thus an example of a $1$-dimensional manifold. However, it is an exceptionally &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt; example. We can find a better one by considering a &lt;em&gt;circle&lt;/em&gt;. Here it is, shown with its small inhabitant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_circle.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A circle&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A circle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, from the point of the bug, the circle and number line ‘look’ the same. The bug can move forward or backward; there’s no way of telling whether it is living on $\mathbb{R}$ or on $S^1$, as mathematicians like to call the circle. The reason for this notation is that the circle is seen as a $1$-dimensional &lt;em&gt;sphere&lt;/em&gt;. Notice that mathematicians do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; consider a sphere to be filled—it is only the &lt;em&gt;outer&lt;/em&gt; line that we are interested in. Think of the surface of a balloon (we will come to that presently) rather than its interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the second dimension, we are—according to our definition—dealing with an object that locally looks like $\mathbb{R}^2$, the two-dimensional Euclidean space. It turns out that we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know this space also from high school as the Euclidean plane, or a &lt;em&gt;Cartesian coordinate system&lt;/em&gt;. Usually, you denote the two axes with $x$ and $y$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_euclidean_plane.svg&quot; alt=&quot;The Euclidean plane and its coordinates&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Euclidean plane and its coordinates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your education went anything like mine, you spent a lot of hours, some happy and some unhappy, by adding mathematical objects to these two axes. From the perspective of our small bug, $\mathbb{R}^2$ looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_infinite_plane.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the bug can move in &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; independent directions here, and its world will appear to be a large plane, much like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains&quot;&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt; would appear to us. Of course, the world of the bug does not have any edges. Again, this is a somewhat boring example of a $2$-manifold. To get something better, we can extend our previous example of the $1$-sphere into the $2$-sphere $S^2$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_sphere.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks awfully familiar—in fact, the $2$-sphere is nothing else than the surface of a ‘ball’ in a $3$-dimensional space, just like the $1$-sphere is the surface of a ‘disk’ in a $2$-dimensional space (note the nice and symmetrical shift in dimensions here). Interestingly, our poor bug has no easy way of checking whether it is living on a sphere or on an infinite plane because it cannot move &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. it does not have access to rocket technology. Moreover, we assume that the bug is really small and does not notice the curvature of the land. One might say that the bug has good reasons to believe in a flat earth because everything is flat from its perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you probably know where this is going, and you shall not be disappointed: let us go to the third dimension, then! To represent three dimensions, we again use a Cartesian coordinate system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_3d_coordinate_system.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of the axes does not matter, but I like $y$ to point upwards because I think of it as a ‘height’. Three dimensions should sound somewhat familiar to you—it turns out that this time, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the bug! From our perspective, our universe has three spatial dimensions, at least &lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;, so we are probably living in (on?) a $3$-manifold. It is thus &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; turn to try to discover some facts about the manifold we are living in, i.e. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe&quot;&gt;shape of the universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that our universe &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a $3$-manifold, what examples of these manifolds are there? Again, the classical one would be the $3$-sphere $S^3$. However, if you followed the discussion from above, you know that the $3$-sphere ‘lives’ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, a $4$-dimensional space. These are typically hard to visualize—but it turns out that there is a neat way to describe spheres of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; dimensions. To see this, let’s start with $d = 1$, the circle. With a radius of $r = 1$, also known as unit radius, the circle contains all points that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 1$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_unit_circle.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A little bit of Pythagoras&amp;amp;rsquo; theorem comes in handy at times&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit of Pythagoras’ theorem comes in handy at times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These equations can be extended to higher dimensions without so much as batting an eyelid! Hence, points on $S^2$, the $2$-sphere, are characterized by satisfying $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, while points on $S^3$, the $3$-sphere, are characterized through $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$. In other words, we need &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; coordinates to describe them. While this is not surprising, it at least gives us an intuitive glimpse about how to treat these objects analytically, even if we are incapable of visualizing them correctly. At least at this point, you are now able to describe the coordinates of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; $d$-dimensional manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this knowledge about manifolds now needs to be put to some use. Already in the $1$-dimensional example, we asked the question how a bug might be able to figure out that they are living in $S^1$ or in $\mathbb{R}$. One easy algorithm requires only two ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An infinitely long rope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An infinite amount of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the description of these two ingredients we can already see that we are now in mathematical territory! The algorithm is straightforward: a bug that wants to figure out the shape of its manifold merely needs to ‘fasten’ the rope at one point and ‘unspool’ it. Next, it merely needs to walk on in a randomly-selected direction, which must never be changed, though. If the bug is living in $S^1$, at some point, it will stumble over its rope. At this point, the algorithm can terminate and the poor bug can finally rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this algorithm will only terminate &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the bug is indeed living in some $S^1$, no matter how large its radius. If the bug is indeed living in $\mathbb{R}$, its journey will continue forever. A somewhat dire fate. How might we extend this to $d = 2$? Obviously, the walking is a little bit more difficult here, as there are &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; independent directions. Nonetheless, if the bug suspects that it is living in $S^2$, it could pick one direction at random, refer to it as ‘North’, and follow it. At some point, it will re-cross its path and thus figure out the shape of its universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a more elegant way, though. If you think back to high school mathematics, you probably proved that the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees. It turns out that you can construct a triangle whose angle sum is 270 degrees, provided you are living in $S^2$, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, our little bug could boldly declare that its current location is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; pole of its universe and follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walk some distance in a straight line. This can be ensured by (again) using copious amounts of rope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn left by 90 degrees. This requires a bug-sized protractor, for example, but we can imagine that a bug civilization that is smart enough to develop mathematics is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; smart enough to build tools for their species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk some distance in a straight line again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn left by 90 degrees and get back to where the bug started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is repeated multiple times and the bug decides to use a sufficiently large distance, it will be possible to describe—or rather &lt;em&gt;inscribe&lt;/em&gt;—a triangle with three right angles. Since this cannot work in the plane, the bug is left with the conclusion that its civilization is living in $S^2$! Here is an illustration of how such a triangle might look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bastian.rieck.me/images/manifolds_sphere_triangle.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug does not even have to go to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; extreme, though, because it is perfectly sufficient to find a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; triangle whose angle sum is more than 180 degrees in order to conclude that one is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; living in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Of course, if the side lengths are sufficiently small, the effects of living in such a curved space are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little thought experiment illustrates &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;curvature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the fundamental concepts for describing manifolds. If you enjoyed this foray into the fascinating world of manifolds, I can recommend the book &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Space&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Weeks_(mathematician)&quot;&gt;Jeffrey R. Weeks&lt;/a&gt;. His writing style is very entertaining and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://geometrygames.org&quot;&gt;geometrygames.org&lt;/a&gt;, he provides numerous programs to visualize and experience numerous manifolds. If you ever wanted to fly &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; a manifold or play mazes on a torus, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect website for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Single-dose propranolol tied to ‘selective erasure’ of anxiety disorders</title>
<link>https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/191908/anxiety-disorders/single-dose-propranolol-tied-selective-erasure-anxiety</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/191908/anxiety-disorders/single-dose-propranolol-tied-selective-erasure-anxiety</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;BARCELONA&lt;/span&gt; – A single 40-mg dose of oral propranolol, judiciously timed, constitutes an outside-the-box yet highly promising treatment for anxiety disorders, and perhaps for posttraumatic stress disorder as well, Marieke Soeter, PhD, said at the annual congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept here is that the beta-blocker, when given with a brief therapist-led reactivation of a fear memory, blocks beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain so as to interfere with the specific proteins required for reconsolidation of that memory, thereby disrupting the reconsolidation process and neutralizing subsequent expression of that memory in its toxic form. In effect, timely administration of one dose of propranolol, a drug that readily crosses the blood/brain barrier, achieves pharmacologically induced amnesia regarding the learned fear, explained &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marieke_Soeter&quot;&gt;Dr. Soeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a clinical psychologist at TNO, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, an independent nonprofit translational research organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like permanent fear erasure. You can never say that something is erased, but we have not been able to get it back,” she said. “Propranolol achieves selective erasure: It targets the emotional component, but knowledge is intact. They know what happened, but they aren’t scared anymore. The fear association is affected, but not the innate fear response to a threat stimulus, so it doesn’t alter reactions to potentially dangerous situations, which is important. If there is a bomb, they still know to run away from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single-session therapy addressing what psychologists call fear memory reconsolidation is totally outside the box relative to contemporary psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, which typically entails gradual fear extinction learning requiring multiple treatment sessions. But contemporary psychotherapy for anxiety disorders leaves much room for improvement, given that up to 60% of patients experience relapse. That’s probably because the original fear memory remains intact and resurfaces at some point despite initial treatment success, according to Dr. Soeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2 decades ago, other investigators showed in animal studies that fear memories are not necessarily permanent. Rather, they are modifiable, and even erasable, during the vulnerable period that occurs when the memories are reactivated and become labile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Dr. Soeter – then at the University of Amsterdam – and her colleagues demonstrated the same phenomenon using Pavlovian fear-conditioning techniques involving pictures and electric shocks in healthy human volunteers. They showed that a dose of propranolol given before memory reactivation blocked the fear response, while nadolol, a beta-blocker that does not cross the blood/brain barrier, did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since the fear memories they could ethically induce in the psychology laboratory are far less intense than those experienced by patients with anxiety disorders, the researchers next conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 45 individuals with arachnophobia. Fifteen received 40 mg of propranolol after spending 2 minutes in proximity to a large tarantula, 15 got placebo, and another 15 received propranolol without exposure to a tarantula. One week later, all patients who received propranolol with spider exposure were able to approach and actually pet the tarantula. Pharmacologic disruption of reconsolidation and storage of their fear memory had turned avoidance behavior into approach behavior. This benefit was maintained for at least a year after the brief treatment session (&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25980916&quot;&gt;Biol Psychiatry. 2015 Dec 15;78[12]:880-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, there was no direct effect of propranolol on spider beliefs. Therefore, do we need treatment that targets the cognitive level? These findings challenge one of the fundamental tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy that emphasizes changes in cognition as central to behavioral modification,” Dr. Soeter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, she and a coinvestigator have been working to pin down the precise conditions under which memory reconsolidation can be targeted to extinguish fear memories. They have shown in a 30-subject study that the process is both time- and sleep-dependent. The propranolol must be given within roughly an hour before to 1 hour after therapeutic reactivation of the fear memory to be effective. And sleep is an absolute necessity: When subjects were rechallenged 12 hours after memory reactivation and administration of propranolol earlier on the same day, with no opportunity for sleep, there was no therapeutic effect: The disturbing fear memory was elicited. However, when subjects were rechallenged 12 hours after taking propranolol the previous day – that is, after a night’s sleep – the fear memory was gone (Nat Commun. 2018 Apr 3;9[1]:1316. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03659-1&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-03659-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Postretrieval amnesia requires sleep to happen. &lt;span class=&quot;tag metaDescription&quot;&gt;Sleep may be the final and necessary link to prevent the process of reconsolidation&lt;/span&gt;,” Dr. Soeter said. It’s still unclear, however, how much sleep is required. Perhaps a nap will turn out to be sufficient, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues at the University of Amsterdam are now using single-dose propranolol-based therapy in patients with a wide range of phobias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The effects are pretty amazing,” Dr. Soeter said. “Everything is treatable. It’s almost too good to be true, but these are our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon her favorable anecdotal experience in treating a Dutch military veteran with severe combat-related PTSD of 10 years’ duration which had proved resistant to multiple conventional and unconventional interventions, a pilot study of single-dose propranolol with traumatic memory reactivation is now being planned in patients with war-related PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After one pill and a 20-minute session, this veteran with severe chronic PTSD has no more nightmares, insomnia, or alcohol problems, and he now travels the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her research met with an enthusiastic reception from other speakers at the ECNP session on PTSD. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Vermetten&quot;&gt;Eric Vermetten, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, welcomed the concept that pharmacologic therapy upon reexposure to fearful cues can impede the molecular and cellular cascade required to reestablish fearful memories. This also is the basis for the extremely encouraging, albeit preliminary, clinical data on ketamine, an &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/N-methyl-D-aspartic_acid&quot;&gt;N-methyl-D-aspartate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; receptor antagonist, as well as &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/34-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-mdma/&quot;&gt;3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MDMA) for therapeutic manipulation of trauma memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Targeting reconsolidation of existing fear memories is worthy of looking into further,” declared Dr. Vermetten, professor of psychiatry at Leiden (the Netherlands) University and a military mental health researcher for the Dutch Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New thinking regarding pharmacotherapy for PTSD is sorely needed, he added. He endorsed a consensus statement by the &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(17)31362-8/abstract&quot;&gt;PTSD Psychopharmacology Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that decried what was termed a crisis in pharmacotherapy of PTSD (Biol Psychiatry. 2017 Oct 1;82[7]:e51-e59. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454621&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.03.007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Epub 2017 Mar 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only have two [Food and Drug Administration]-approved medications for PTSD – sertraline and paroxetine – and they were approved back in 2001,” Dr. Vermetten noted. “Research has stalled, and there is a void in new drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soeter’s study of the time- and sleep-dependent nature of propranolol-induced amnesia was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, where she is employed.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2019/3/27/you-should-organize-a-study-groupbook-clubonline-groupevent-tips-on-how-to-do-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not long after I left school, I missed certain parts of it. Not enough of it to want to go back-- every time I considered that, I remembered all I didn't want-- but enough to try to recreate the good parts for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-rte-list=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulating intellectual discussion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from more experienced people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete tasks to work on, structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback from others on those tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting people with similar interests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some bad parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-rte-list=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugly power dynamics between professors/authority figures and students&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High praise &amp;amp; value placed on grades &amp;amp; scores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy workload that made it hard to maintain work/life balance, especially while working jobs too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High pressure associated with scarcity- only so many could get into top schools, only so many get A's, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timed &amp;amp; graded tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not enough space/time to truly play and explore and mess up and keep playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've organized many different types of groups and gotten quite good at community organizing. Some of the groups I've organized throughout the years: math study groups, game engine forum/chats, psychology book clubs, programming workshops, electronics workshops, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written one post on how I organized the workshops back in 2016, you can find it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2016/11/1/guide-to-running-technology-workshops&quot;&gt;http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2016/11/1/guide-to-running-technology-workshops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I'll discuss some new developments to my thinking along with other practices that are more applicable outside of workshops. Keep in mind this is not exhaustive at all-- please let me know if you'd like elaboration on anything or more content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this inspires you to organize some groups of your own and make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to gather people?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a newbie, the best advice I can give is to structure the group in such a way that you're okay with only 2-3 people joining. Surely you can find 2-3 others who are interested? You can gather people from work, other social gatherings, social media, friends of friends who mentioned it to people they know, or even public sites like meetup.com .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a newbie at organizing is tricky, because you're going to have an easier time with people you know (they'll be more forgiving of your mistakes), but strangers allow you to help more people and make a truly diverse event. Either way, don't be afraid to start small. I talked a little more on this in the workshop blog post but I want to be sure to mention this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was something I didn't always have when first organizing groups years ago, and I learned over time why it's necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some aspects of a good code of conduct:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol data-rte-list=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper descriptions of inappropriate behavior. Trust me, it's a rare day that someone who acted badly thinks they're abusive, racist, sexist, or that they even did anything wrong. Even when it's obvious. Community organizing will surprise you like that. You need to find a way to describe inappropriate behavior that even someone who thinks they're in the right can agree with. For instance, someone is unlikely to admit they were sexist, but they could admit they gave unsolicited advice and didn't speak from their own experience using &quot;I&quot; statements. Not the best example, but hopefully you see what I'm getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about more than just preventing disasters— it’s about defining the social context of the event. Good code of conducts give people a sense of what to expect from interaction with that group, and set the tone for what kind of space it is. Asking someone on a date might feel borderline harassing at a professional gathering (depending on how senior the person is, gender ratio, etc), but is perfectly expected at a singles' mixer. Talking about a trauma you went through with strangers might feel toxic and creepily out of place in a game meetup, and welcome in a psychology book club. Context matters. Set the tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to report violations, ideally ways that work even if an organizer with power and favor did the bad thing. This is a real tough one, and I imagine one that will constantly evolve. We can look to politics for examples. These days, I keep it simple with my small and short-lived groups and opt for a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model-- all violations reported to me, I can kick anyone out for any reason (helps if I messed up with point #1, which you'll inevitably do). However, this is not a great model for longer-running groups or bigger groups, as trust me, all organizers are flawed and it does create a bad power dynamic (exactly what I'd like to avoid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make reporting easy and obvious. One of my favorite creative examples is signs I saw at one event in the women's bathrooms about instructions on how to report sexual harassment, including words you could use to discretely report it while the harasser was still bothering you (like ordering certain drinks). But you can have more straightforward ways, just consider how violations could happen and how you'll handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have mild consequences for mild violations or little corrections to members, not just &quot;you're kicked out at any violation whatsoever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of one I used at my latest small book club: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/6kA93uPV&quot;&gt;https://pastebin.com/6kA93uPV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a larger one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.contributor-covenant.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.contributor-covenant.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great post with lots more detail (written by someone which much much more experience than me!) on code of conducts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq&quot;&gt;https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Interact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Chats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, people don't like having an extra tab or app open. Unless your group really provides something special, and even if it does, it'll often silently die if you require this. Lately I've been liking Twitter DM chats for small, short-lived groups. I've also had a lot of success with forums like Google Groups that send members e-mail updates, because everyone checks their e-mail, and success with Slack if the group had enough interest/momentum. The Slack ones have died fast when momentum dropped, though-- that requires consistent activity and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Person Gatherings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talked about a bit in the workshop blog post (linked to in the Introduction). I've used mostly the same ideas, and since then also realized how many community spaces Seattle has-- for instance, an extra room in my local coffee shop they reserve for free, or a long table in another that I can also be sure no one sits at during the meetup time. Check out your local coffee shops, bookstores, library, any low-cost space (for instance, I wouldn't recommend a restaurant unless you could cover the bill yourself) for community spaces. Tech companies or coworking spaces like WeWork also host events for free, often just requesting they get to pitch your attendees on whatever they're offering (hiring positions, getting memberships, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location is a socioeconomic issue and matters. Whenever possible, inconvenience the people with money and make it convenient for those in poorer areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video Calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually send out a link that anyone can click on to join, typically using Hangouts. However, people who are more professional than me tend to prefer Zoom and I'd recommend it from my experience. Also check out the software of choice of digital conferences-- things get trickier the bigger your audience. I've seen one organizer do a smaller Hangouts group that was streamed with live chat, but it's nice when audience members can participate more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most interesting topic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Book Clubs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found 100 pages every two weeks is a manageable amount and it seems the internet agrees with me. This is about 2 hours of focused reading, which you would think could be done in a shorter time, but keep in mind people (including me) often need to get in the right headspace and feel at peace enough to read the book, which may only happen on one lucky Saturday morning in those two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set guidelines upfront that the topics should stay around the book-- for instance, quoting passages, asking questions about a concept the book introduces, mentioning related resources, or sharing experiences related to the book. Fiction will be different than non-fiction, I've mostly done nonfiction psychology texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set an example. If you're contributing thoughtfully in the way you want others to, other thoughtful contributions that mirror yours will fall in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a mix of chat and video calls for this format, so remote people can join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note on moderating discussions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is heavily discussion-based, I keep in mind lessons I've learned in other areas of life. From seminars in college, I learned-- 1/3 of your speaking should be questions, 1/3 should be rephrasing/underlining what others have said, and 1/3 should be your own contributions. From group therapy sessions, I learned taking breaks in discussion and allowing silence is so important for peace and inclusion. I also learned the power of &quot;I&quot; statements, not giving unsolicited advice to others, and avoiding sensitive topics. I love moderating discussions and examining what makes a healthy discussion, and I think I'm going to incorporate more discussions in different kinds of groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've experienced both great failures and great successes with study groups, mostly focused on mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad ones were ones where it started to resemble the bad parts of school-- too much work and structure, and elitism/talking down to newbies. It's surprisingly hard to squash the latter as an organizer, you want to prevent those issues before they come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to learn that it's important to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-rte-list=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let people still participate even if they fall behind, and if you do keep a schedule read the book club rules, make it easy to keep up with even if life is busy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful about requiring previous knowledge, even on advanced texts. I'd caution against it. Let people self-select out or in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, schedules aren't necessary at all. I've run study groups that are pretty broad (say, mathematics themed) and just brought a bunch of library books for all to grab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring supplies and copies of the books, keep in mind not everyone has much money. In the past I even brought gift cards I'd discretely distribute before the study group started to those who needed it, so they could buy their own books for next time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep watch on members tutoring each other. Unsolicited, and sometimes even solicited, tutoring can very quickly turn condescending and overbearing during a time that's supposed to be a pleasant hobby activity. Setting the appropriate tone is the way to go to prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let people talk casually about their lives and be generally social (unlike the book club), but make sure there's still an area that's peaceful/relatively quiet or an expectation that it's okay not to join in on the discussion (I often explicitly said this). Moderate what the social expectations are, what the context is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to like in person gatherings at coffee shops (no reservations made, just showed up) for this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workshops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See workshop post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General networking groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I've organized something like this it's never had much structure, though that's normal for this type of group-- people often make meetups or conferences with talks that transition to general networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically do a slack group or e-mail forum with any theme apparent in the title and code of conduct very visible-- especially important whenever the group is mostly unstructured/unthemed discussion and interaction. One thing I've found that's important is that I actually have the bandwidth/energy to check in regularly to moderate. As a result, many of these types of groups have died over the years (though some have also died because of implicit or explicit code of conduct violations from members that were too bad for the group to come back from). Nonetheless, I keep coming back to this format because I find it very rewarding when done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend not to like in person for this format because I am not a fan of an audience being talked to. I'd prefer something more collaborative that didn't imply weird power dynamics about who is special enough to get to be the speaker and who has to just be a mute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small groups grabbing meals are very common and tend to work well. You've got to keep an eye on making sure the attendees are from diverse backgrounds and some are out of your network. The problem with these small groups, of course, is a lot more people would love to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another kind is general networking surrounding something more passive, like demo booths set up. I actually really like this concept as a way to allow more people to come to the event while not elevating anyone to be a speaker or panelist. I think in the future I may experiment with larger moderated discussions too.&lt;/p&gt;
