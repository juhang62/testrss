<title>Dear Apple: Your Services Are No Longer Required</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I was among the biggest Apple Evangelists to ever live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was in my DNA.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I believed in Apple’s products, Apple’s services, and Apple’s mission (or at least what they said their mission was).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I was an Apple employee for nearly 13 years, and I loved helping people get the most out of their Apple products.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; All of that ended about 6 months ago when Apple showed me its true colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late January I decided to help an elderly friend with a data migration at home.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; He had just bought a new iMac and needed to transfer the data from his old one to his new one.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Apple offers free data transfers, but my friend didn’t want to leave both of his machines with Apple for 3 to 5 days in order for them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2 weeks later I was approached by my boss.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Someone told him that I had helped a friend with his computer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I told him that yes I had in fact helped a friend with a data transfer (something Apple does for free) and that I had helped him on my own time.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; He told me that I had just admitted to a major conflict on interest, and that an official investigation in to my actions would now start, two days later I was suspended.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Six days after that I receive a letter in the mail informing me that my actions were in violation of Apple’s business conduct policy, specifically their conflict of interest policy, and that my services were no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes after I received certified letter in the mail I received a phone call from my now former bosses.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; They asked me how I was feeling about the news I just got in the mail and if I was ok.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; At the time I had nothing relevant to say to them.  I had just been fired for helping someone, what was it they wanted me to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks to COVID I’ve had the past 6 months to think about it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Here’s what I have to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is a company that holds itself out as a company that cares; that “Thinks Different”. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their current recruiting video states: “To the constant beginners who sing off key against the beat.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; To those unfamiliar with convention, unmoved by rules, and reborn with every new discovery.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Those open to daydreams and night dreams and visions and mirages.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Who can see the millions shades of green in a field of grass.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Whose days are filled with mysteries that cannot be solved with facts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You are more powerful than you think… …and you are welcome here.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I can tell you that based on my final experience with Apple that they are anything but open to those with new ideas or those who go against the status quo.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If any of that was true they wouldn’t have fired me for helping a customer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 24 years (3/4 of my life!) learning and knowing and loving Apple.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I lived it, I breathed it, I bled it, and I worked for it for almost 13 years.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I did everything I could to hold Apple in the highest regard.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I’ve collected just about everything Apple has ever made, and I’ve subscribed to every service that they’ve offered.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Now it sickens me to think that I built my entire life on the lie that Apple is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What can I do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can start by telling Apple this:&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Your services are no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start by never buying a new Apple product again.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I’m going to unsubscribe from all paid Apple Services.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Because I won’t be buying any new Apple devices, I won’t ever need&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; AppleCare or AppleCare+ again, I can easily build my own cloud storage instead of paying for extra iCloud storage, I’ve can subscribe to Spotify for music instead of paying for Apple Music (by the way, Spotify can even be used on PowerPC Macs, Apple Music can’t), I can play all the games that are not on Apple Arcade, I can watch all of the Television shows that aren’t on AppleTV+, and I can get my news from sources other than Apple News+.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is not the company the same company it was when I first fell in love with them, Apple is now a company that (as of the moment I’m writing this) is worth $1,967,000,000,000. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Apple has become the kind of company that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-the-ios-app-store/#36bf0fdd6e7b&quot;&gt;bullies App developers by removing their Apps from its App Store&lt;/a&gt; when they don’t want to pay them a significant cut of their profits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354644&quot;&gt;sues tiny businesses for copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt; because they don’t want them to use a logo that looks nothing like their own, and fires its most loyal employees for daring to help someone in need.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; These aren’t the actions of a company that cares about its customers, employees, and the communities it serves;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; they’re the actions of Mobsters shaking down the little guy for protection money and snuffing out anyone they just don’t happen to like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I no longer want anything to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook account now required to login to Oculus devices</title>
<link>https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Today, we’re announcing some important updates to how people log into Oculus devices, while still keeping their VR profile. Starting in October 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Everyone using an Oculus device for the first time will need to log in with a Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you’re an existing user and already have an Oculus account, you’ll have the option to log in with Facebook and merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you’re an existing user and choose not to merge your accounts, you can continue using your Oculus account for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;After January 1, 2023, we will end support for Oculus accounts. If you choose not to merge your accounts at that time, you can continue using your device, but full functionality will require a Facebook account. We will take steps to allow you to keep using content you have purchased, though we expect some games and apps may no longer work. This could be because they include features that require a Facebook account or because a developer has chosen to no longer support the app or game you purchased. All future unreleased Oculus devices will require a Facebook account, even if you already have an Oculus account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Giving people a single way to log into Oculus—using their Facebook account and password— will make it easier to find, connect, and play with friends in VR. We know that social VR has so much more to offer, and this change will make it possible to integrate many of the features people know and love on Facebook. It will also allow us to introduce more Facebook powered multiplayer and social experiences coming soon in VR, like Horizon, where you can explore, play, and create worlds. The majority of our users are already logging into Oculus with a Facebook account to use features like chats, parties, and events, or to tune into live experiences in Oculus Venues. We’re also making it easier to share across our platforms if you’d like. For example, people already have the option to livestream or share their VR experience on Facebook, and soon you’ll be able to use your VR avatar on other Facebook apps and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;When you log in with a Facebook account, you can still create or maintain a unique VR profile. And if you don’t want your Oculus friends to find you by your Facebook name, they won’t—just make it visible to ‘Only Me’ in your Oculus settings. You can also choose what information about your VR activity you post to your Facebook profile or timeline, either by giving permission to post or by updating your settings. And we plan to introduce the ability for multiple users to log into the same device using their own Facebook account, so people can easily share their headset with friends or family while keeping their information separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Using a VR profile that is backed by a Facebook account and authentic identity helps us protect our community and makes it possible to offer additional integrity tools. For example, instead of having a separate Oculus Code of Conduct, we will adopt Facebook’s Community Standards as well as a new additional VR-focused policy. This will allow us to continue to take the unique considerations of VR into account while offering a more consistent way to report bad behavior, hold people accountable, and help create a more welcoming environment across our platforms. And as Facebook adds new privacy and safety tools, Oculus can adopt and benefit from them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We will be updating our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to reflect these changes and will be sending a notice to users before the changes take effect. This update will make it clear that the Oculus platform is provided by Facebook and will include information on how our users’ data is managed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-new-features-from-facebook-to-help-people-connect-in-vr-and-an-update-to-our-privacy-policy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;As we’ve previously shared&lt;/a&gt;, when you log into Oculus using your Facebook account, Facebook will use information related to your use of VR and other Facebook products to provide and improve your experience. This information is also used to show you personalized content, including ads. For example, we might show you recommendations for Oculus Events you might like, ads about Facebook apps and technologies, or ads from developers for their VR apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We understand that this is a significant change, which is why we’re sharing the news early. We will update existing users who choose not to log in with a Facebook account as we get closer to ending support for Oculus accounts in 2023. In the meantime, here are answers to some questions you may be asking to help make everything clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changes are coming to accounts on Oculus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Starting in October 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Everyone using an Oculus device for the first time will need to log in with a Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you are an existing user and already have an Oculus account, you will have the option to log in with Facebook and merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you are an existing user and choose not to merge your accounts, you can continue using your Oculus account for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Starting In January 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We will end support for Oculus accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you choose not to merge your accounts at that time, you can continue using your device, but full functionality will require a Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We will take steps to allow you to keep using content you have purchased, though some games and apps may no longer work. This could be because they require a Facebook account or because a developer has chosen to no longer support the app or game you purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;All future unreleased Oculus devices will require a Facebook account, even if you already have an Oculus account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you making these changes to accounts on Oculus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Oculus is owned by Facebook and is one of Facebook’s apps and technologies. Using a Facebook account provides a single way to log into Oculus devices and makes it easier to find, connect and play with friends in VR. It also enables Facebook-powered social experiences, like live streaming gameplay to your Facebook timeline, making calls with parties, joining events, and exploring new experiences like Facebook Horizon. And as Facebook adds new privacy and safety tools, they can be added in VR too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What social features does Facebook provide in VR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Some examples of social features that Facebook provides on Oculus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Chats — Chat with friends in or out of the headset, and quickly hop into games together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;User and developer-created events — Organize tournaments or multiplayer games with friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Livestreaming — Share gameplay to your Facebook timeline from VR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Sharing to Groups — Post to VR-related Facebook Groups under your VR username&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Parties — Create open parties to meet up with friends in-VR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I still have a profile for VR experiences that is different from my Facebook profile?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Yes. If you already have a unique username from your Oculus account, you will be able to continue using that username in VR. If you don’t have a VR username, you’ll be able to create one when you set up your profile for VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will my VR activity be posted to Facebook without my permission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;No. If you log into your Oculus device with your Facebook account, you can choose what information about your VR activity you post to your Facebook profile or timeline, either by giving permission to post or by updating your settings. If you are an existing user and you choose not to merge your Oculus account and Facebook account, you will not have access to Facebook-powered social features and you will not be able to post your VR activity to your Facebook profile or timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to my data when I log into an Oculus device with my Facebook account?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;When you log into your Oculus device with your Facebook account or merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts, we will use information related to your use of Oculus and Facebook for purposes such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Providing and improving your experience across Facebook products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Promoting safety and integrity on our services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Showing you personalized content, including ads, across Facebook products. This could include recommendations for Oculus Events you might like, ads about Facebook apps and technologies, or ads from developers for their VR apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Examples of the information we use include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The VR apps you use, so we can recommend new apps you haven’t tried yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Your Facebook friend list, to make it easier to find and interact with your Facebook friends who are also in VR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Invites and acceptances for events you create&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Information like your name and messaging metadata for chats in VR, so that you have access to your chats across devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Your photos and related content like captions, likes and comments if you share photos from VR to Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Information about your VR activity, like which apps you use, to show you ads for other VR apps you may like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Information about your activity on other Facebook products, such as Pages you like and groups you join, to recommend content and things to do in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will a Facebook account be required to use future Oculus devices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bzdropcap&quot;&gt;As of June 30, 2020, Backblaze had 142,630 spinning hard drives in our cloud storage ecosystem spread across four data centers. Of that number, there were 2,271 boot drives and 140,059 data drives. This review looks at the Q2 2020 and lifetime hard drive failure rates of the data drive models currently in operation in our data centers and provides a handful of insights and observations along the way. As always, we look forward to your comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Hard Drive Failure Stats for Q2 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of Q2 2020, Backblaze was using 140,059 hard drives to store customer data. For our evaluation we remove from consideration those drive models for which we did not have at least 60 drives (see why below). This leaves us with 139,867 hard drives in our review. The table below covers what happened in Q2 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-95870 size-large&quot; title=&quot;Quarterly Hard Drive Failure Stats for Q2 2020&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q2-2020-AFR-1024x947.png&quot; alt=&quot;Backblaze Q2 2020 Annualized Hard Drive Failure Rates Table&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;947&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q2-2020-AFR-1024x947.png 1024w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q2-2020-AFR-300x278.png 300w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q2-2020-AFR-768x710.png 768w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q2-2020-AFR-560x518.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes and Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for Q2 2020 was 0.81% versus Q1 2020 which was 1.07%. The Q2 AFR number is the lowest AFR for any quarter since we started keeping track in 2013. In addition, this is the first time the quarterly AFR has been under 1%. One year ago (Q2 2019), the quarterly AFR was 1.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this quarter, three drive models had 0 (zero) drive failures: the Toshiba 4TB (model: MD04ABA400V), the Seagate 6TB (model: ST6000DX000) and the HGST 8TB (model: HUH728080ALE600). While the Toshiba 4TB drives recorded less than 10,000 drive days, we have not had a drive failure for that model since Q4 2018, or 54,054 drive days. In comparing drive days with the Toshiba drive, the Seagate 6TB and HGST 8TB drives are just as impressive, having no failures in the quarter yet recording 80,626 and 91,000 drive days respectively in Q2 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 192 drives (140,059 minus 139,867) that were not included in the list above because we did not have at least 60 drives of a given model. For example, we have: 20 Toshiba 16TB drives (model: MG08ACA16TA) we are putting through our certification process. On the other end of the spectrum, we still have 25 HGST 4TB drives (model: HDS5C4040ALE630), putting in time in Storage Pods. Observant readers might note the model number of those HGST drives and realize they were the last of the drives produced with Hitachi model numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminiscing aside, when we report quarterly, yearly, or lifetime drive statistics, those models with less than 60 drives are not included in the calculations or graphs. We use 60 drives as a minimum as there are 60 drives in all newly deployed Storage Pods. Note: The Seagate 16TB drive (model: ST16000NM001G) does show 59 drives and is listed in the report because the one failed drive had not been replaced at the time the data for this report was collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, all the data from all of the drive models, including boot drives, is included in the files which can be accessed and downloaded on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hard Drive Test Data&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What We Deployed in Q2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deployed 12,063 new drives and removed 1,960 drives via replacements and migration in Q2, giving us a net of 10,103 added drives. Below is a table of the drive models we deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-95872 size-full&quot; title=&quot;What We Deployed in Q2&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Drive-Deployed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Table: Drives Deployed in Q2 2020&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Drive-Deployed.jpg 560w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Drive-Deployed-300x166.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Trends by Manufacturer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarterly data is just that, data for only that quarter. At the beginning of each quarter we wipe out all the previous data and we start compiling new information. At the end of the quarter, we bundle that data up into a unit (collection, bag, file, whatever), and name it; Q2 2020, for example. This is the type of data you were looking at when you reviewed the Quarterly Chart for Q2 2020 shown earlier in this report. We can also compare the results for a given quarter to other quarters, each their own unique bundle of data. This type of comparison can reveal trends that can help us identify something that needs further attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the AFR by manufacturer using quarterly data over the last three years. Following the chart is two tables. The first is the data used to create the chart. The second is the count of the number of hard drives corresponding to each quarter for each manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The data for each manufacturer consists of all the drive models in service which were used to store customer data. There were no boot drives or test drives included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The 0.00% values for the Toshiba drives from Q3 2017 through Q3 2018 are correct. There were no Toshiba drive failures during that period. Note, there were no more than 231 drives in service at any one time during that same period. While zero failures over five quarters is notable, the number of drives is not high enough to reach any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The “n/a” values for the WDC drives from Q2 2019 onward indicate there were zero WDC drives being used for customer data in our system during that period. This does not consider the newer HGST drive models branded as WDC as we do not currently have any of those models in operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. WDC: The WDC data demonstrate how having too few data points (i.e. hard drives) can lead to a wide variance in quarter to quarter comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Toshiba: Just like the WDC data, the number of Toshiba hard drives for most of the period is too low to reach any decent conclusions, but beginning in Q4 2019, that changes and the data from then on is more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Seagate: After a steady rise in AFR, the last two quarters have been kind to Seagate, with the most recent quarter (AFR = 0.90%) being the best we have ever seen from Seagate since we started keeping stats back in 2013. Good news and worthy of a deeper look over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. HGST: With the AFR fluctuating between 0.36% and 0.61%, HGST drives win the prize for predictability. Boring, yes, but a good kind of boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cumulative Trends by Manufacturer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to quarterly data, cumulative data starts collecting data at a given point and new data is added until you stop collecting. While quarterly data reflects the events that took place during a given quarter, cumulative data is everything about our collection of hard drives over time. Using cumulative data, we can see longer term trends over the period, as in the chart below, with the data table following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-95875 size-full&quot; title=&quot;Cumulative Hard Drive Trends by Manufacturer&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chart-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Backblaze Cumulative Annualized Hard Drive Failure Rates by Manufacturer Chart&quot; width=&quot;825&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chart-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR.jpg 825w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chart-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chart-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chart-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-560x353.jpg 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-95876 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cumulative Annualized Hard Drive Failure Rates by Manufacturer Table&quot; width=&quot;920&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR.jpg 920w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-300x78.jpg 300w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-768x200.jpg 768w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Cumulative-AFR-560x146.jpg 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Down and to the Right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all manufacturers, you can see a downward trend in AFR over time. While this is a positive occurrence, we do want to understand why and incorporate those learnings into our overall understanding of our environment—just like drive failure, drive “non-failure” matters too. As we consider these findings, if you have any thoughts on the subject, let us know in the comments. Maybe you think hard drives are getting better, or is it more likely that we’ve added so many new drives in the last three years that they dominate the statistics, or is it something else? Let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifetime Hard Drive Failure Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the lifetime AFR for the hard drive models we had in service as of June 30, 2020. The reporting period is from April 2013 through June 30, 2020. All of the drives listed were installed during this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-95877 size-full&quot; title=&quot;Lifetime Hard Drive Failure Rates&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Lifetime-AFR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Backblaze Lifetime Annualized Hard Drive Failure Rates&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Lifetime-AFR.jpg 720w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Lifetime-AFR-300x283.jpg 300w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Table-Q2-2020-Lifetime-AFR-560x529.jpg 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes and Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifetime AFR was 1.64%, the lowest since we started keeping track in 2013. In addition, the lifetime AFR has fallen from 1.86% in Q2 2018 to the current value, even as we’ve passed milestones like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/exabyte-unlocked&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;exabyte of storage&lt;/a&gt; under management, opening a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/announcing-our-first-european-data-center&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;data center in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly doubling the size of the company. A busy two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Seagate 12TB drives (model: ST12000NM001G) were installed in Q2, so while we have a reasonable amount of data, as a group these drives are still early in their lifecycle. While not all models follow the bathtub curve as they age, we should wait another couple of quarters to see how they are performing in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seagate 4TB drives (model: ST4000DM000) keep rambling along. With an average age of nearly five years, they are long past their warranty period (one or two years depending on when they were purchased). Speaking of age, the drive model with the highest average age on the chart is the Seagate 6TB drive at over 64 months. That same model had zero failures in Q2 2020, so they seem to be aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hard Drive Stats Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete data set used to create the information used in this review is available on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hard Drive Test Data webpage&lt;/a&gt;. You can download and use this data for free for your own purpose. All we ask are three things: 1) You cite Backblaze as the source if you use the data, 2) You accept that you are solely responsible for how you use the data, and 3) You do not sell this data to anyone—it is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want the summarized data used to create the tables and charts in this blog post you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/Backblaze_Blog/Q2_2020_Drive_Stats_Chart_Data.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;download the ZIP file&lt;/a&gt; containing the MS Excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and let us know if you find anything interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Popular seafood species in sharp decline around the world</title>
<link>https://news.ubc.ca/2020/07/21/popular-seafood-species-in-sharp-decline-around-the-world/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ubc.ca/2020/07/21/popular-seafood-species-in-sharp-decline-around-the-world/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Fish market favourites such as orange roughy, common octopus and pink conch are among the species of fish and invertebrates in rapid decline around the world, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study of its kind, researchers at UBC, the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and the University of Western Australia assessed the biomass—the weight of a given population in the water—of more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations. They discovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the populations analyzed, 82 per cent were found to be below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields, due to being caught at rates exceeding what can be regrown. Of these, 87 populations were found to be in the “very bad” category, with biomass levels at less than 20 per cent of what is needed to maximize sustainable fishery catches. This also means that fishers are catching less and less fish and invertebrates over time, even if they fish longer and harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first-ever global study of long-term trends in the population biomass of exploited marine fish and invertebrates for all coastal areas on the planet,” said Maria “Deng” Palomares, lead author of the study and manager of the &lt;em&gt;Sea Around Us&lt;/em&gt; initiative in UBC’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries.“When we looked at how the populations of major species have been doing in the past 60 years, we discovered that, at present, most of their biomasses are well below the level that can produce optimal catches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach their findings, the researchers applied computer-intensive stock assessment methods known as CMSY and BSMY to the comprehensive catch data by marine ecosystem reconstructed by the Sea Around Us for the 1950-2014 period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest declines in stocks were found in the southern temperate and polar Indian Ocean and the southern polar Atlantic Ocean, where populations shrunk by well over 50 per cent since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of globe showed declining trends in fish and invertebrates, the analysis found a few exceptions. One of these was the Northern Pacific Ocean where population biomass increased by 800 per cent in its polar and subpolar zones, and by about 150 per cent in its temperate zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these pockets of improvement, the overall picture remains cause for concern, according to co-author Daniel Pauly, principal investigator at &lt;em&gt;Sea Around Us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the exceptions, our findings support previous suggestions of systematic and widespread overfishing of the coastal and continental shelf waters in much of the world over the last 60-plus years,” said Pauly. “Thus, pathways for improvements in effective fisheries management are needed, and such measures should be driven not only by clearly set total allowable annual catch limits, but also by well-enforced and sizeable no-take marine protected areas to allow stocks to rebuild.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fishery biomass trends of exploited fish populations in marine ecoregions, climatic zones and ocean basins” was published in &lt;em&gt;Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Aug. 18, 2020 · The Rust Core Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;151.00615743052&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust project was originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c01efc669f09508b55eced32d3c88702578a7c3e&quot;&gt;conceived in 2010&lt;/a&gt; (depending on how you count, you might even say &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graydon/rust-prehistory/commit/b0fd440798ab3cfb05c60a1a1bd2894e1618479e&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;!) as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Research&lt;/a&gt; project, but the long term goal has always been to establish Rust as a self-sustaining project. In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html&quot;&gt;with the launch of Rust 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, Rust established its project direction and governance independent of the Mozilla organization. Since then, Rust has been operating as an autonomous organization, with Mozilla being a prominent and consistent financial and legal sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla was, and continues to be, excited by the opportunity for the Rust language to be widely used, &lt;em&gt;and supported&lt;/em&gt;, by many companies throughout the industry. Today, many companies, both large and small, are using Rust in more diverse and more significant ways, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Firecracker&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime&quot;&gt;Fastly’s Lucet&lt;/a&gt;, to critical services that power &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/enjoy-a-slice-of-quic-and-rust/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/1passwordx-december-2019-release/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, August 11th 2020, Mozilla &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their decision to restructure the company and to lay off around 250 people, including folks who are active members of the Rust project and the Rust community. Understandably, these layoffs have generated a lot of uncertainty and confusion about the impact on the Rust project itself. Our goal in this post is to address those concerns. We’ve also got a big announcement to make, so read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying the impact these layoffs have had on all members of the Rust community, particularly the folks who have lost their jobs in the middle of a global pandemic. Sudden, unexpected layoffs can be a difficult experience, and they are made no less difficult when it feels like the world is watching. Impacted employees who are looking for job assistance can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://talentdirectory.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s talent directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the deep personal impact, the Rust project as a whole is very resilient to such events. We have leaders and contributors from a diverse set of different backgrounds and employers, and that diversity is a critical strength. Further, it is a common misconception that all of the Mozilla employees who participated in Rust leadership did so as a part of their employment. In fact, many Mozilla employees in Rust leadership &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1294023260770770944&quot;&gt;contributed to Rust in their personal time&lt;/a&gt;, not as a part of their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to emphasize that membership in Rust teams is given to individuals and is not connected to one’s employer. Mozilla employees who are also members of the Rust teams continue to be members today, even if they were affected by the layoffs. Of course, some may choose to scale back their involvement. We understand not everyone might be able to continue contributing, and we would fully support their decision. We're grateful for everything they have done for the project so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting a foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the project has grown in size, adoption, and maturity, we’ve begun to feel the pains of our success. We’ve developed legal and financial needs that our current organization lacks the capacity to fulfill. While we were able to be successful with Mozilla’s assistance for quite a while, we’ve reached a point where it’s difficult to operate without a legal name, address, and bank account. “How does the Rust project sign a contract?” has become a question we can no longer put off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we began &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/01/09/towards-a-rust-foundation/&quot;&gt;investigating the idea of creating an independent Rust foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Rust Team with prior experience in open source foundations got together to look at the current landscape, identifying the things we’d need from a foundation, evaluating our options, and interviewing key members and directors from other foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on that work, &lt;strong&gt;the Rust Core Team and Mozilla are happy to announce plans to create a Rust foundation. The Rust Core Team's goal is to have the first iteration of the foundation up and running by the end of the year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foundation’s first task will be something Rust is already great at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html&quot;&gt;taking ownership&lt;/a&gt;. This time, the resource is legal, rather than something in a program. The various trademarks and domain names associated with Rust, Cargo, and crates.io will move into the foundation, which will also take financial responsibility for the costs they incur. We see this first iteration of the foundation as just the beginning. There’s a lot of possibilities for growing the role of the foundation, and we’re excited to explore those in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, we remain laser-focused on these initial narrow goals for the foundation. As an immediate step the Core Team has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/core#project-foundation&quot;&gt;selected members to form a project group&lt;/a&gt; driving the efforts to form the foundation. Expect to see follow-up blog posts from the group with more details about the process and opportunities to give feedback. In the meantime, you can email the group at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:foundation@rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;foundation@rust-lang.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leading with infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have only begun the process of setting up the foundation, over the past two years the Infrastructure Team has been leading the charge to reduce the reliance on any single company sponsoring the project, as well as growing the number of companies that support Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts have been quite successful, and — as you can see on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/sponsors&quot;&gt;sponsorship page&lt;/a&gt; — Rust’s infrastructure is already supported by a number of different companies throughout the ecosystem. As we legally transition into a fully independent entity, the Infrastructure Team plans to continue their efforts to ensure that we are not overly reliant on any single sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to start the next chapter of the project by forming a foundation. We would like to thank everyone we shared this journey with so far: Mozilla for incubating the project and for their support in creating a foundation, our team of leaders and contributors for constantly improving the community and the language, and everyone using Rust for creating the powerful ecosystem that drives so many people to the project. We can’t wait to see what our vibrant community does next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Hey Joe! How are you doing? Everyone here loved meeting you, and we would really love to have you on board as our investor! We really respect your expertise, and think this could be a great partnership. What do you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Glad to hear! Can you give me more details about how much money you’re looking for, and what I would be getting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Sure. We’re looking for a $100,000 commitment, and in return, you would be getting 0.1% of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: In order for me to value your company accurately, do you mind sharing your financial books with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Unfortunately, we can’t do that. That information is classified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: You shared them with your earlier investors though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, but I’m afraid we can’t share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Ok. I guess we’ll just have to make do with the valuation from your most recent funding round. Can you share more details about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Sure. At our recent round 2 months ago, we were valued at $30M, post-money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: So, 0.1% of your company works out to $30,000… you’re asking me to commit $100,000 in exchange for $30,000 worth of equity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: No no no Joe. You’re not looking at it the right way. You can’t just value 0.1% of the company as being worth $30,000. No one has any idea where we’re going to end up in the future. How would you even value an early-stage startup like us anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Well clearly you were able to agree on a valuation with your previous investors…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, but that’s not the right way to approach this Joe. Startup outcomes are completely bimodal. Either we’re going to be successful, in which case your equity will be worth an astounding amount, even though you’re getting so little. Or we’re going to fail, in which case it will be worthless, no matter how much equity you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Well, I’m still concerned about the expected return for the risk I’m taking. And you still haven’t explained why you’re quoting me a valuation that’s so much higher than the valuation that you agreed to with your previous investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Look Joe, we’re looking for someone who believes in us and our vision. Someone who believes that we’re going to be the next unicorn. And when that happens, your $100,000 investment will grow into a cool $1M! Surely that’s a fair return on your investment? If you don’t believe in that vision, and if you aren’t willing to make sacrifices to be part of our team, maybe we don’t want you as our investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Well, I do believe in your vision and want to be a part of it. I just want to get the same amount of preferred stock that your other investors…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Hold up! Who said anything about preferred stock. I’m afraid only our other investors will be getting preferred stock, not you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: So you’re both quoting me a higher valuation, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I’ll be getting only common stock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: Not exactly. You’ll be getting options for common stock, with a strike price set to the company’s current Fair-Market-Value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: So when you guys eventually get to a liquidity event, I can then exercise these options and make money off them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: If everything goes well! We’ll need you to continue investing in us, every year, until we get acquired or go IPO. If at any point you decide that you don’t want to continue investing more money, you’ll have 90 days to exercise your options immediately. Otherwise, you’ll lose them forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: But that’s so risky! Exercising those options is going to be very expensive, and that’s going to increase my risk even further because the stock is still illiquid! Not to mention that if the startup does become a unicorn like you were saying, I’ll get hit with a massive AMT bill that I won’t even be able to pay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves here Joe. That’s all so far away! Who knows what’s going to happen 5 years from now. Most startups don’t grow that much you know. Let’s just finish the deal now, and if the need arises, the board can vote to change the terms of your options in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: And what if the board chooses not to? What if the startup does grow quite a bit, and I get hit with a huge AMT bill? My money would already be committed by then and I’d be SOL. Can’t you guys just replace this 90-day clause with a 10-year expiry, so that I wouldn’t have to deal with all these risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: I’m afraid we can’t do that for you Joe. Besides, we want investors who are committed to us for the long haul. If you don’t want to keep investing in us for the next 10 years, maybe you don’t deserve to keep your equity. It would be best for everyone if we took away your equity and gave it to the people who are still with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founder&lt;/em&gt;: … So, what do you say? Can we count on your $100,000?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investor&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah… no. I think I’m going to go invest in Google instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re taking a $X pay cut to join a startup, you’re really investing $X in them. Far be it from me to tell you how to spend your money, but make sure you’re happy with what you’re getting in return.

<title>Modeling a Wealth Tax</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/wtax.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/wtax.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/modeling-a-wealth-tax-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;186&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Modeling a Wealth Tax&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition to income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levels of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose the wealth tax is 1%. That means each year you get to keep 99% of the stock that's subject to it. Which means after 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a 1% wealth tax means the government will, over the course of your life, take 45% of all stock over the threshold at which the tax starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The shares will of course become more valuable as the company reinvests its earnings in growth. But it's optimistic to hope it will be able to do so for 60 years; at some point it will have to pay dividends, which will get taxed before you can reinvest them. So really this model is an upper bound on how well you'll do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how much stock the government will take over 60 years at various levels of wealth tax:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;wealth tax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;government takes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.1%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;6%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;26%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;45%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;70%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;84%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;91%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax means that if you start a successful company in your 20s, the government will over the course of your life take two thirds of all stock over the threshold at which the tax starts. And by 5% this threshold is getting close to being an upper bound on how much of the company you get to keep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year's income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a .5% wealth tax would start to keep founders away from a state or country that imposed it. That's more than a quarter of all stock over the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;noscript readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;This article relies a lot of interactive demos that use JavaScript. I understand you're disabling JavaScript because you've been burned by heavy scripts and tracking on other sites, but the article really doesn't work without the ability to play with it. I write every line of code in these demos from scratch, minus the snippet of Google Analytics that lets me know when people read these so I can join in the conversation. Feel free to block Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;introduction&quot; readability=&quot;25.386309992132&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Explanations is to try to allow people to play with fun parts of computers. Graphics, compression, audio. The tagline is my biggest inspiration: &quot;Play, don't show&quot;, riffing off the typical &quot;Show, don't tell&quot; rule of writers and authors everywhere. Why bother giving a diagram when I give you an inspector and let you poke at things yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes me a long time to write an Explanation, so these might not come out as quick as you like, but I do plan on writing these as long as I'm able to. I also don't claim to be the world's expert on most everything I'm writing about. I might be wrong! Please let me know by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jstpierre@mecheye.net&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magcius/xplain/issues/new&quot;&gt;a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, this series was known as &quot;Xplain&quot; and was more focused on the X11 window system and protocol, but I've been slowly moving towards anything that interests me, and I'm hijacking this project for it since I really like the format and style I've developed. The code for every single one of these demos is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magcius/xplain&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and I do try to comment heavily and go into even more depth there! Play with the code! Use it for one of your own projects! It's all MIT/X11 licensed. I very much appreciate followup questions and any sort of feedback through the links mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;credits&quot; readability=&quot;28.541241162608&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Credit where credit's due&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code to this article and all demos is freely available under the MIT/X11 license on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/magcius/xplain&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the more tricky code in there has been ported from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver&quot;&gt;Xorg X server&lt;/a&gt; itself along with its helper library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/&quot;&gt;pixman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the images in this article have been adapted from other images on the web. The two kitten images in the Expose event demo were adapted from photos taken by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/titrans/&quot;&gt;quatre mains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/fazen/&quot;&gt;fazen&lt;/a&gt;, shared under a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC-BY-2.0&lt;/a&gt; license.

<title>Having an alter ego can reduce anxiety, benefit confidence: research</title>
<link>https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200817-the-batman-effect-how-having-an-alter-ego-empowers-you</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200817-the-batman-effect-how-having-an-alter-ego-empowers-you</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The researchers had suspected that the alter ego would be a more extreme form of self-distancing, and the results showed exactly that. While the children thinking in the third person spent about 10% more time on the task that those thinking in the first person, it was the children inhabiting their alter egos who stuck it out for the longest of all. Overall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.12695&quot;&gt;they spent 13%more time on the task than those thinking in the third person&lt;/a&gt; (and 23% more than those thinking about their behaviour in the first person).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White has also found that adopting an alter ego can also help children to concentrate on a complex card game, in which they had to follow complex rules that kept on changing. Once again, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997842/&quot;&gt;the Batman effect” seemed to have increased their resolve and concentration&lt;/a&gt;, improving their “executive function”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these were laboratory experiments, White hopes that this small exercise might ease many situations that require self-control. The test of perseverance, after all, was already very close to the kind of decisions that children might face when doing their homework with the potential temptation of the TV or cell phone. She thinks it may also be useful to avoid feeling dispirited during new challenges. “Pretending to be someone who's more competent, and getting that distance from the situation, could help them to overcome the frustration they're feeling when they're learning something new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would Beyoncé do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these findings and the benefits of self-distancing more generally, White suspects that we could all boost our emotional regulation, self-control and general poise by choosing to embody another persona à la Sasha Fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, certain religious initiatives already encourage this kind of thinking, she says. “When I was growing up in the ‘90s, there were all these bracelets that said, ‘WWJD’ – What would Jesus do?” she says. “So, I think it’s a pretty intuitive concept to a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it yourself, White suggests picking a different person for different types of goals – maybe a wise member of your family for a personal dilemma, or a work mentor for a professional problem. “When I was a postdoc, we had a little saying in our lab that if you're an undergrad, pretend to be a grad student. If you are a grad student, pretend to be a postdoc, and if you're a postdoc, pretend to be the leader of the lab – just to get you to that next level,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever persona we choose, the practice should create some psychological space away from potentially distracting feelings, while also reminding us of the behaviours we want to emulate. Whether we’re placing ourselves in the shoes of a friend, a religious figure, or Beyoncé herself, a little imagination might put us all a little closer to the person we wish to become.&lt;/p&gt;
