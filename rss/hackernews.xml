<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hether crows, ravens, and other “corvids” are making multipart tools like hooked sticks to reach grubs, solving geometry puzzles made famous by Aesop, or nudging a clueless hedgehog &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail/videos/crow-helps-hedgehog-across-the-street/729558684479564/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;across a highway&lt;/a&gt; before it becomes roadkill, they have long impressed scientists with their intelligence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the birds can add one more feather to their brainiac claims: &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb1447&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; unveiled on Thursday in Science finds that crows know what they know and can ponder the content of their own minds, a manifestation of higher intelligence and analytical thought long believed the sole province of humans and a few other higher mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abc5534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, also in Science, looked in unprecedented detail at the neuroanatomy of pigeons and barn owls, finding hints to the basis of their intelligence that likely applies to corvids’, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label&quot;&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Together, the two papers show that intelligence/consciousness are grounded in connectivity and activity patterns of neurons” in the most neuron-dense part of the bird brain, called the pallium, neurobiologist Suzana Herculano-Houzel of Vanderbilt University, who wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abe0536&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;analysis of the studies&lt;/a&gt; for Science, told STAT. “Brains can appear diverse, and at the same time share profound similarities. The extent to which similar properties present themselves might be simply a matter of scale: how many neurons are available to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the minds of nonhuman animals promises to shed light on the origins of such cognitive abilities as, in this case, knowing and analyzing the contents of one’s own brain. That’s how people solve challenges and make discoveries — what do I know? what if I look at it this way? — and it’s a pillar of higher intelligence. Knowing what you know is also a form of consciousness, and the discovery that more and more nonhumans seem to have it raises tricky questions about how we treat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label&quot;&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has been a good week for bird brains!” said crow expert John Marzluff of the University of Washington, who was not involved in the new studies. In particular, the discovery that crows know what they know will not surprise avian scientists, “who have increasingly demonstrated the cognitive abilities of birds, … but they will be relieved! This research is groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether crows know and can analyze the contents of their brains, neurobiologist Andreas Nieder of the University of Tübingen in Germany trained two birds to peck a red or a blue target on a panel, depending whether they saw a faint light. Nieder kept varying the “rule,” with the birds told which color meant what — red = saw it, or blue = saw it — only after the flash. That required the crows, Glenn and Ozzy, to keep monitoring their brains; they had a second or two to figure out what they had seen and tell Nieder by choosing the corresponding target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the crows were solving these tasks, the researchers were tracking the activity of hundreds of their neurons. (Crows’ brains have 1.5 billion neurons, as many as some monkey species.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the crows reported having seen a faint light, sensory neurons were active between the flash and the birds pecking the color that meant, yes, I saw that. If the crows did not perceive the very same faint stimulus, the nerve cells remained silent, and the bird pecked, no, I didn’t see anything. Ozzy and Glenn’s brain activity systematically changed depending on whether or not they had perceived the dim flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the delay, many neurons responded according to the crows’ impending report, rather than to the brightness of the light. “A population of neurons contained information about the crows’ subjective experience throughout the trial,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birds were aware of what they subjectively perceived, flash or no flash, correctly reporting what their sensory neurons recorded, Nieder told STAT. “I think it demonstrates convincingly that crows and probably other advanced birds have sensory awareness, in the sense that they have specific subjective experiences that they can communicate,” he said. “Besides crows, this kind of neurobiological evidence for sensory consciousness only exists in humans and macaque monkeys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more standard&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that neurons in the most complex part of the crows’ brain, the pallium, “do have activity that represents not what was shown to them, but what they later report,” said Herculano-Houzel. Neurons “represent what the animals next report to have seen — whether or not that is what they were shown,” she said. The neurons figure this out, so to speak, during the time lapse between when Nieder tells the birds the rule and when they peck the target to indicate their answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s exactly what one would expect from neurons that participated in building the thoughts that we later report,” she said, suggesting that corvids “are as cognitively capable as monkeys and even great apes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked in unprecedented detail at the neuroanatomy of pigeons and barn owls, finding hints to the basis of their intelligence that likely applies to corvids’, too. Scientists have long known that crows and ravens have unusually large forebrains, but unlike mammals’ forebrains — the neocortex — corvids’ do not have the six connected layers thought to produce higher intelligence. But theirs do have “connectivity patterns … reminiscent of the neocortex,” scientists led by Martin Stacho of Ruhr-University in Germany &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abc5534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the pigeons’ and owls’ neurons meet at right angles, forming computational circuits organized in columns. “The avian version of this connectivity blueprint could conceivably generate computational properties reminiscent of the [mammalian] neocortex,” they write. “[S]imilar microcircuits … achieve largely identical cognitive outcomes from seemingly vastly different forebrains.” That is, evolution invented connected, circuit-laden brain structure at least twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In theory, any brain that has a large number of neurons connected into associative circuitry … could be expected to add flexibility and complexity to behavior,” said Herculano-Houzel. “That is my favorite operational definition of intelligence: behavioral flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That enables pigeons to home, count, and be as trainable as monkeys. But for sheer smarts we’re still in the corvid camp. A 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103049&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that New Caledonian crows, rooks, and European jays can solve an Aesop’s Fable challenge, dropping stones into a water-filled tube to bring a floating bit of food within reach, something kids generally can’t do until age 7. These birds were the first nonhuman animals to solve the task.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Work on What Matters</title>
<link>https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We all have a finite amount of time to live, and within that mortal countdown we devote some fraction towards our work. Even for the most career-focused, your life will be filled by many things beyond work: supporting your family, children, exercise, being a mentor and a mentee, hobbies, and so the list goes on. This is the sign of a rich life, but one side-effect is that time to do your work will become increasingly scarce as you get deeper into your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing. For a while you can try sleeping less or depriving yourself of the non-work activities you need to feel whole, but you’ll inevitably find that your work maintains a aloof indifference to your sacrifice rather than rewarding it. Only through &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/&quot;&gt;pacing your career to your life&lt;/a&gt; can you sustain yourself for the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, pacing yourself becomes the central challenge of a sustained, successful career: increasingly senior roles require that you accomplish more and more, and do it in less and less time. The ledge between these two constraints gets narrower the further you go, but it remains walkable if you take a deliberate approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a discussion on a few common ways to get tripped up: &lt;em&gt;snacking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;preening&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;chasing ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. Then we’ll get into the good stuff: how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you work on what really matters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avoid snacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter Walk recommends that folks &lt;a href=&quot;https://hunterwalk.com/2016/06/18/the-best-startups-resists-snacks-im-not-talking-about-food/&quot;&gt;avoid “snacking”&lt;/a&gt; when they prioritize work. If you’re in a well-run organization, at some point you’re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The later choice--easy and low-impact--is what Walk refers to as &lt;em&gt;snacking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding but you’re unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for some of them it might be a good development opportunity), and there’s a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you’re spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you’re more likely to self-determine your work and if you’re not deliberately tracking your work, it’s easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stop preening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where “snacking” is the broad category of doing easy and low-impact work, there’s a particularly seductive subset of snacking that I call “preening.” Preening is doing low-impact, high-visibility work. Many companies conflate high-visibility and high-impact so strongly that they can’t distinguish between preening and impact, which is why it’s not uncommon to see some companies’ senior-most engineers spend the majority of their time doing work of dubious value but that is frequently recognized in company meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking a short-term look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://yenkel.dev/posts/how-to-achieve-career-growth-opportunities-skills-sponsors&quot;&gt;career growth&lt;/a&gt;, then optimizing for your current organization’s pathologies in evaluating impact is the optimal path: go forth and preen gloriously. However, if you’re thinking about developing yourself to succeed as your &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/&quot;&gt;current role grows in complexity&lt;/a&gt; or across multiple organizations, then it’s far more important to strike a balance between valued work and self-growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also an important factor to consider when choosing a company to work at! Dig into what a company values and ensure it aligns with your intended personal growth. If a company’s leadership is entirely folks who focus their energy on performant urgency or acts of fealty, don’t be surprised when your success in the company depends on those activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, to be a successful preener requires a near invulnerability to criticism of your actual impact, and your true work &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; suffer if your energy is diverted to preening. Typically this means you need to be a vanity hire of a senior leader or to present yourself in the way a company believes leaders look and act. If that isn’t you, then your attempt to exchange your good judgement for company success will end up failing anyway: you’ll get held accountability for the lack of true impact where others who match the company’s expectation of how a leader appears will somehow slip upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stop chasing ghosts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many folks would assume that companies, rational optimizers that they are, avoid spending much time on low-impact high-effort projects. Unfortunately that isn’t consistently the case. It’s surprisingly common for a new senior leader to join a company and immediately drive &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/grand-migration/&quot;&gt;a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand&lt;/a&gt;. The ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing into meaningless work at a grand scale. This can be surprisingly challenging when during your hiring process you’ve been repeatedly told that you’ve been hired to fix something deeply broken -- you’re the newly-hired savior, of course your instincts are right! Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a recent discussion with someone who argued that new senior leaders &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; push for major changes even though they suspect the efforts will fail. Such changes make the organization increasingly dependent on the new leader, and also ensures anything that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go well gets attributed to the new leader directly rather than their team. If this is your approach to leadership, please know that you’re awful and take the time to work on yourself until the well-being and success of an entire company matters to you more than being perceived as essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Existential issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re done snacking, preening and chasing ghosts, the first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether your company is experiencing an existential risk. Companies operate in an eternal &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/iterative-elimination-tournaments/&quot;&gt;iterative elimination tournament&lt;/a&gt;, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present. If you’re about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running out of money, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/digg-v4/&quot;&gt;like my experience at Digg&lt;/a&gt;, can be the most obvious issue, but not every existential issue is financial, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/&quot;&gt;Twitter’s fail whale stability challenges&lt;/a&gt; or adapting to the shifts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something dire is happening at your company, then that’s the place to be engaged. Nothing else will matter if it doesn’t get addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work where there’s room &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existential issues are usually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the most efficient place to add your efforts, but efficiency isn’t a priority when the walls are crashing down around you. You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn’t existential then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone’s already focused. Folks often chase leadership’s top priority, but with so many folks looking to make their impact there, it’s often challenging to have a meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work. What are priorities that will become critical in the future, where you can do great work ahead of time? Where are areas that are doing &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; but could be doing &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; with your support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ll find work that’s &lt;em&gt;worthy&lt;/em&gt; of attention, but which an organization is incapable of paying attention to, usually because its leadership doesn’t value that work. In some companies this is developer tooling work, in others it’s inclusion work, and in most companies it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://noidea.dog/glue&quot;&gt;glue work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is almost always a great deal of room to do this sort of work that no one is paying attention to, so you’ll be able to make rapid initial progress on it, which &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a good opportunity to invest. At some point, though, you’ll find that the work needs support, and it’s quite challenging to get support for work that a company is built to ignore or devalue. Your early wins will slowly get eroded by indifference and misalignment, and your initial impact will be reclaimed by the sands of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you shouldn’t do inclusion work? No, that’s not the conclusion I want you to take away from this. Sometimes an area that an organization doesn’t pay attention to is so important that you’re going to want to advocate for it to start paying attention. Teaching a company to value something it doesn’t care about is considerably the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. As a senior leader, you have an ethical obligation that goes beyond maximizing your company-perceived impact, but it’s important to recognize what you’re up against and time our efforts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foster growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that’s often underinvested in (e.g. lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is growing the team around you. &lt;em&gt;Hiring&lt;/em&gt; has a lot of folks involved in it, usually in terms of optimizing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/&quot;&gt;hiring funnel&lt;/a&gt;, but onboarding, mentoring and coaching are wholly neglected at many companies despite being &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/&quot;&gt;as impactful as hiring to your company’s engineering velocity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start dedicating even a couple hours a week to developing the team around you, it’s quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification that unlocks a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those small changes, quick modifications and short conversations as &lt;em&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; your team’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your organizational privilege, relationships you’ve built across the company, and ability to see around corners derived from your experience, you can often shift a project outcomes by investing the smallest ounce of effort, and this is some of the most valuable work you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly valuable because it’s quick, it’s easy, it’s highly motivating for both you and the person you help, and it’s hugely impactful when done well. (Also, it’s highly demotivating when done poorly, so your approach matters!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finish things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One special sort of editing is helping finish a project that just can’t quite close itself out. Often you’ll have a talented engineer earlier in their career who is already doing the work but can’t quite create buy-in or figure out how to rescope their project into finishable work. It’s surprisingly common that coaching a teammate on how to tweak a project into something finishable, and then lending them your privilege to budge the right friction points will transform a six month slog into a two week sprint with almost an identical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y98RG8/&quot;&gt;only get value from finishing projects&lt;/a&gt;, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage. Time spent getting work finished is always time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What only you can&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final category of work that matters is the sort that you’re uniquely capable of accomplishing. Sure there’s work that you’re faster at or better at than some other folks, but much more important is the sort of work that simply won’t happen if you don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is an intersection of what you’re exceptionally good at and what you genuinely care about. It might be &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/&quot;&gt;writing your company’s technology strategy&lt;/a&gt; that folks &lt;em&gt;will actually follow&lt;/em&gt;, it might be convincing a great candidate to join, it might be changing your CEO’s mind on how you pay down tech debt, it might &lt;a href=&quot;https://increment.com/apis/api-design-for-eager-discering-developers/&quot;&gt;be crafting a discerning API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, things that simply won’t happen if you don’t do them are your biggest opportunity to work on something that matters, and it’s a category that will get both narrower and deeper the further you get into your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interviewing for a new role twenty years into your career, the folks interviewing you won’t know what your real impact was on any given project you worked on, nor will they know your true contribution to any of the companies you worked at. Instead you’ll find yourself judged by a series of surprisingly subjective measures: your prestige, the prestige of the titles you’ve had and companies you’ve worked at, your backchannel reputation, and how you present in your interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend your career snacking, preening or chasing ghosts, it’s possible but relatively unlikely that what you’ve done before will be valued at companies you interview with. Instead, the only viable long-term bet on your career is to do work that matters, work that develops your and to steer towards companies that value genuine expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Escaping the Dark Forest</title>
<link>https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract. This is our story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to wrap up for the night when I decided to take another look at some smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t expecting anything interesting, of course. Over the past few weeks I had seen countless yield farming clones launch with the exact same pitch: stake your tokens with us and you could be the next cryptocurrency millionaire. Most were simply forks of well-audited code although some tweaked bits and pieces, sometimes with catastrophic results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But amidst all of the noise there was some code I hadn’t seen before. The contract held over 25,000 Ether, worth over 9,600,000 USD at the time, and would be a very juicy payday for anyone who managed to find a bug in its logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly looked through the code for where Ether is transferred out and found two hits. One of them transferred the Ether to a hardcoded token address, so that could be ignored. The second was a burn function that transferred Ether to the sender. After tracing the usage of this function, I discovered that it would be trivial for anyone to mint tokens to themselves for free, but then burn them in exchange for all of the Ether in the contract. My heart jumped. Suddenly, things had become serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some digging revealed that the contract I had found was part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lien.finance/&quot;&gt;Lien Finance&lt;/a&gt;’s protocol. Unfortunately, their team was anonymous! The only IM platform they supported was Telegram, and I couldn’t be sure that the admins of that channel were actually protocol developers or just a few early supporters. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally leak the exploit to the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After browsing their website a little while longer, I noticed that they had worked with ConsenSys Diligence and CertiK for an audit. This seemed like a good avenue, since both ConsenSys and CertiK must have interacted with the developers during their audits. I quickly pinged &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maurelian_&quot;&gt;maurelian&lt;/a&gt; on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;You never want to be on the receiving end of this message
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, time ticked on, my heart kept pounding, but there was no response from maurelian. It seemed like he had already gone to sleep. Desperate, I sent a message to the ETHSecurity Telegram channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Artist's rendering of the message, since I deleted the original
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, I got a message from someone I’d worked with quite a few times in the past - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wadealexc&quot;&gt;Alex Wade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My head had just hit the pillow when I got a knock on my door. It was my roommate: “Sam’s in the ETHSec Telegram asking for anyone from Diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;It was, in fact, a long night
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Sam, this couldn’t be good. I found a channel we’d set up with Lien a few months ago and an email address. Better than nothing, given their team was anon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still half asleep. Sam, not wanting to commit details to text, asked for a Zoom call. Groggily wishing I was back in bed, I attempted to gauge the severity of the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Five minutes later, it was clear that the situation called for coffee
&lt;p&gt;Sam and I reviewed the code together. By this point, Sam had already prepared a sample exploit and was able to confirm the issue on his machine. The conversation quickly turned to discussing options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attempt to exploit the issue ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to Lien and have them go public, urging users to withdraw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of these were appealing options. The first was risky because, as discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff&quot;&gt;Ethereum is a Dark Forest&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danrobinson&quot;&gt;Dan Robinson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gakonst/&quot;&gt;Georgios Konstantopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, the possibility of our transactions getting frontrun was very real. The second option was similarly risky, as a public announcement would draw attention to the problem and create a window of opportunity for attackers. We needed a third option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling a section from &lt;em&gt;Ethereum is a Dark Forest&lt;/em&gt;, Sam reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/epheph&quot;&gt;Scott Bigelow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in a situation like this, we suggest you reach out to Scott Bigelow, a security researcher who has been studying this topic and has a prototype implementation for a better obfuscator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After participating in the recovery attempt from &lt;em&gt;Ethereum is a Dark Forest,&lt;/em&gt; which ultimately lost to front-runners, I was hungry for a re-match. I’ve spent time monitoring front-running and designing a simple system that seemed able to fool generalized front-runners, at least for the $200 I’d been able to test it with. When Sam reached out to me in the late evening with the innocent-sounding “mind staying up for another hour or so”, I couldn’t wait to try it out! I was already working it out: how I’d make a few tweaks, stay up a couple hours, feel a sense of accomplishment having helped rescue and return a few thousand dollars of user funds, and get a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those plans immediately fell apart when Sam shared the contract with me: ~25,000 ETH, valued at $9.6M, at stake. For as much as I wanted that rematch, $9.6M was way outside my humble script’s weight class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past few months, I had been trying to establish contacts with miners for this very purpose: white-hat transaction cooperation. If ever there was a time to appeal to a miner to include a transaction without giving front-runners the chance to steal it, it was now. Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tzhen&quot;&gt;Tina&lt;/a&gt; and I have worked together over the past few months on establishing this cooperation. It seemed like a slim chance at the time, but it was worth a shot: let’s bring Tina into the rescue attempt to work with a mining pool to mine a private transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had just evacuated from the Bobcat forest fire and was sipping on unknown beachy drinks zoning out to the monotonic sound of dark Pacific waves, when a Telegram DM from Sam buzzed me back to a darker reality: “funds at risk, frontrunnable”. Over the last few weeks, I had been collaborating with Sam and Scott on a research project on MEV and could already guess their ask before they sent it: a direct channel to shield a whitehat tx from getting sniped by the “advanced predators” in the mempool’s “dark forest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a risky move that entailed exposing our strategy to miners, we decided we should first try to get the greenlight from the anonymous Lien team. While Alex was trying to get in contact via ConsenSys-internal channels, we tried to loop in CertiK as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized it may take another 4 hours before Certik's US-based auditors would wake up, yet the clock was ticking.  Knowing nothing much about CertiK beyond the fact it had serviced quite a few Asian projects, I tried to reach the CertiK China team to arbitrage the time zone difference. I blasted a casual sounding message in “DeFi the World” and “Yellow Hats” WeChat groups. Four leads slid into my DMs independently within 30 minutes, confirming the WeChat ID that I connected with was indeed the real Zhaozhong Ni, CTO of CertiK. I was added to a WeChat group with 5 CertiK team members, yet at this point I was still not in a position to disclose the project nor the vulnerability. To minimize the exposure and potential liability, we could only invite one member from Certik to join our whitehat operation. After passing a final verification via official email, Georgios Delkos, the engineering lead at CertiK joined our call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Georgios’s help, Alex was able to quickly get in contact with the Lien team and verify their identity. We brought them up-to-speed on the current situation and asked for their permission to try working directly with a mining pool to rescue the vulnerable funds. After some deliberation, the Lien team agreed that the risk from trying to rescue the funds directly or publishing a warning was too high, and gave the go-ahead to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we needed to identify a mining pool that had the infrastructure ready in place and would be willing to cooperate with us ASAP. Which mining pool should we tap? Which contact from the pool would be in a position to make technical decisions swiftly that help us beat the clock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SparkPool came to mind, as I knew they had been working on a piece of public infrastructure called Taichi Network that could easily offer what we needed. I decided to ping Shaoping Zhang, SparkPool’s co-founder, who had helped me investigate mempool events in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, Shaoping responded: “You mean do we have a whitelist service for transactions? Sorry, we don’t.” Oops, something was lost in translation, “whitehat” and “whitelist” sounded similar in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s 10mn dollar worth of funds at risk. samczsun is on the line.” I tried again to communicate the situation without revealing any specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1000w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are you guys saving the world again? Do you need help from our mining pool?” To my surprise and great relief, Shaoping jokingly extended an offer to help. After official email verification, Shaoping popped into our marathon Zoom call with the support of a roomful of SparkPool devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lunch, just when I was about to take a nap, I received a message from Tina: “Has SparkPool ever helped with whitehat transactions??” I mistook it for whitelisting a transaction at first. No whitehats had approached us before, and we were not familiar with what “whitehat transactions” entailed. After Tina explained it in more details, I realized that what they needed was a private transaction service, i.e. the whitehats wanted to send transactions to save a DeFi contract, but in order to prevent getting front-runned, they needed a mining pool to include the transaction without broadcasting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been working on a “private transaction” feature on our Taichi Network, which was still under development and had not been tested. I brought the whitehats’ request to our development team, and explained the urgency: our private transaction feature needed to be in production within a few hours. Our devs said they could try their best to finish in time, and we immediately got to work. We finished development of the private transaction feature in 2 hours, and then spent some time fixing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we completed our internal testing, we sent the &lt;em&gt;whitehat.taichi.network&lt;/em&gt; endpoint to Scott Bigelow to deliver the whitehat payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SparkPool was working to deliver this brand new whitehat API, Sam and I were finishing the script to generate 4 sequential signed transactions. Processing these transactions in order would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; withdraw the ~25,000 ETH itself, but would transfer 30,000 SBT+LBT tokens (which were “falsely” created) to the Lien team, allowing them to submit the final transaction to convert these tokens back into ETH. By transferring the infinitely mintable SBT+LBT tokens to Lien instead of ETH, we used more transactions to obscure how the attack worked from generalized front-runners (in case of a re-org), and &lt;em&gt;I was able to avoid incurring $9.6M of income, even if for a moment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had generated 4 signed transactions, Sam and I spent a long time verifying their combinated behavior using a variety of multi-call transaction simulation tools. These 4 transactions, less than 1.5KB of data in total, were ready to heist $9.6M of assets, so long as no-one but SparkPool sees them until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested SparkPool’s whitehat endpoint with a meaningless transaction, and it worked exactly as expected: the transaction was not seen in the mempool, then suddenly appeared as part of a SparkPool block! It was like watching water vapor turn directly into ice without that &lt;em&gt;pesky&lt;/em&gt; liquid phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adapting the transaction-creation script to feed the transactions directly to SparkPool’s new endpoint, it was time. I hesitated for a moment, but this was absolutely our best effort. We might lose $9.6M, but there would be no regrets: I hit “run” in IntelliJ. I’m not sure why, but I expected it to take a while, like node would understand the gravity of the situation and take its time. It did not; the transactions were sent in a matter of milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone on the call began refreshing Etherscan with such vigor, I wondered if the Etherscan team would see a 3-minute spike in traffic. Since only SparkPool had the transactions, and only a portion of SparkPool’s hash rate was dedicated to this purpose, there was nothing to do but sweat and wait. Each block that appeared from another miner mocked us. Someone on the call would announce the miner to nervous chuckles. The ~15 blocks it took before our transactions were included felt like hours, but finally, we had our immaculate transactions: mined, in order, not reverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched with relief as more and more blocks were built on top of ours and our concerns about block re-orgs quickly faded. The Lien team was now in possession of enough SBT+LBT tokens to liquidate their entire system, and Sam went to coordinate the final phase of the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we had successfully transferred the tokens to Lien and there was no sign of any frontrunning, attempted or otherwise, we quickly pinged them with the good news. They confirmed that they received the tokens and immediately sent out a transaction to withdraw the bulk of the ether stored in the contract. Seconds later, a pending transaction appeared on Etherscan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we watched the loading indicator spin, I took the opportunity to reflect upon the events that lead to this moment. What had started as a quick glance at some contracts ended up turning into full-blown warroom that pulled in experts from around the world. Without Alex and Georgios, we wouldn’t have been able to make contact with the Lien developer. Without Scott, we would’ve been going into a rescue blind. Without Tina, we wouldn’t have been able to get in contact with CertiK or SparkPool. Without SparkPool, we would’ve been doomed to repeat the history that Dan had written about just weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet on a late Tuesday night, our unlikely group united under a common cause and worked tirelessly to try and ensure that over 9.6 million dollars would be returned to their rightful owners. All of our efforts over the last 7 hours led to this single pending transaction and the spinning dots that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the loading indicator finally turned into a green checkmark, the tense silence on the call gave way to a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had escaped the dark forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was the culmination of the hard work of many people. Special thanks to Alex Wade, Scott Bigelow, Tina Zhen, Georgios Delkos, and SparkPool for being there when the ecosystem needed you most, as well as Alex Obadia and Dan Robinson for reviewing this post and providing feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An update to the Timescale license</title>
<link>https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we are announcing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/legal/licenses&quot;&gt;update to the Timescale License&lt;/a&gt;, which governs many of the advanced features of TimescaleDB, including native compression, multi-node, continuous aggregations, and more. This update loosens restrictions and provides expanded rights to users, reinforcing our commitment to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notably, this update adds the “right-to-repair”, the “right-to-improve”, and eliminates the paid enterprise tier and usage limits altogether (thus establishing that all of our software will be available for free). These changes will apply with TimescaleDB 2.0, which supports distributed hypertables for multi-node scale-out, slated for release next month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we first announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-we-are-building-an-open-source-business-a7701516a480/&quot;&gt;how we were building a self-sustaining open-source business in the cloud era&lt;/a&gt;, and that we had started developing features under a new, source-available license called the &lt;strong&gt;Timescale License (TSL)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the TSL was a radical idea: a source-available license that was open-source in spirit, but that contained a main restriction: preventing companies from offering software licensed under the TSL ia a hosted database-as-a-service. We added this restriction, which only applies to &amp;lt;0.0001% of all possible TimescaleDB users, to enable us to build a self-sustaining business in a world that was rapidly moving to the cloud. (And importantly, we did not and have never re-licensed any of our open-source software, which continues to be licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE&quot;&gt;Apache 2 license&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSL, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open&quot;&gt;Elastic License before it&lt;/a&gt;, and like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.confluent.io/blog/license-changes-confluent-platform/&quot;&gt;Confluent Community License (coincidentally launched around the same time)&lt;/a&gt;, are examples of what we call “Cloud Protection Licenses.” These licenses attempt to maintain an open-source spirit, but recognize that the cloud has increasingly become the dominant form of open-source commercialization. So these licenses protect the right of offering the software in the cloud for the main creator/maintainer of the project (who often contributes 99% of the R&amp;amp;D effort). &lt;strong&gt;This “cloud protection” is what enables open-source businesses like ours to become self-sustaining in the cloud era.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since these licenses are not officially sanctioned by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OSI), whom many view as the arbiters as to what is and isn’t officially “Open-source”, these licenses are generally not considered “Open-source” (capital O) (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative&quot;&gt;the OSI has had some controversy this year&lt;/a&gt;, so this sentiment may be shifting). At the same time, many developers still call these licenses “open-source” (lower-case o) because they embody the same open, transparent, collaborative spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, this experiment has proved successful, exceeding our expectations. The Timescale community has continued to grow to over 500,000 active databases today. The TSL governs many of our new advanced features, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database/&quot;&gt;native compression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-a-distributed-time-series-database-on-postgresql/&quot;&gt;multi-node&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.timescale.com/latest/using-timescaledb/continuous-aggregates&quot;&gt;continuous aggregations&lt;/a&gt;, and adoption of these features has continued without friction. The public cloud providers have been deterred from offering these TSL features for free (and are now reaching out to discuss revenue sharing agreements). And other OSS entrepreneurs have reached out for advice on how to create similar licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this experiment has gone so well that today, we are announcing an update to the TSL that reinforces our commitment to our community. &lt;strong&gt;This update loosens restrictions and provides expanded rights to users, including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New: Right-to-repair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New: Right-to-improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All enterprise features are now free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more usage limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified legalese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes will go into place with TimescaleDB 2.0, slated for release next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, we explain why we are making these changes, what this means for users, and why we think this is necessary for the open-source industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-timescaledb&quot;&gt;What is TimescaleDB?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TimescaleDB is the leading relational database for time-series data, engineered on top of PostgreSQL, offered via free software or as a fully-managed service on AWS, Azure, and GCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TimescaleDB offers massive scale (100s billions of rows and millions of inserts per second on a single server), &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database/&quot;&gt;94%+ native compression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.timescale.com/latest/introduction/timescaledb-vs-postgres&quot;&gt;10-100x faster queries than PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-vs-influxdb-for-time-series-data-timescale-influx-sql-nosql-36489299877/&quot;&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/time-series-data-cassandra-vs-timescaledb-postgresql-7c2cc50a89ce/&quot;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-to-store-time-series-data-mongodb-vs-timescaledb-postgresql-a73939734016/&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; – all while maintaining all of the reliability, ease-of-use, SQL interface, and overall goodness provided by PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially launched in April 2017, TimescaleDB has come a long way in just 3.5 years, with tens of millions of downloads and over 500,000 active databases today. The TimescaleDB developer community today includes organizations like AppDynamics, Bosch, Cisco, Comcast, DigitalOcean, Fujitsu, IBM, Rackspace, Schneider Electric, Samsung, Siemens, Uber, Walmart, Warner Music, and thousands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of the Timescale Community is a clear sign that software developers need a new database to rely on for their time-series data, and that increasingly more and more are turning to TimescaleDB. But even with all this adoption, how does one build a sustainable business, particularly given the predatory actions of some public cloud providers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter “Cloud Protection Licenses,” like the Timescale License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-cloud-protection-licenses-and-why-are-they-necessary&quot;&gt;What are “Cloud Protection Licenses”, and why are they necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that long ago, the open-source business model was straightforward: companies run your software, and when they need help or advanced capabilities, they pay you for commercial support or enterprise features. This is the world in which today’s Open-source licenses were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world has changed. Today companies would rather pay someone to run your software, thus obviating the need for paid support (and making selling enterprise capabilities much harder). The standard Open-source licenses allow anyone to completely commercialize your software without contributing any software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other words, the rise of the Cloud has cut off the primary business model for open-source software.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter new licenses like the Timescale License, Elastic License, Confluent Community License, and others. These licenses, which we call “Cloud Protection Licenses”, attempt to maintain an open-source spirit, but protect the right of offering the software in the cloud for the main creator and maintainer of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This “cloud protection” is what enables open-source businesses like ours to become self-sustaining in the cloud era.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may ask, “Why create a new license - why not just compete with public clouds by just providing the best product experience on a level playing field?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the playing field is far from level. Today, the public cloud vendors (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) are trillion dollar corporations – the largest companies in the world – and have a myriad of advantages that arise from that size, including market position, pricing power, deep balance sheets, and (what many have even called) unfair business practices (source: Wall Street Journal articles from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015&quot;&gt;April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-restricts-advertising-competitor-device-makers-roku-arlo-11600786638&quot;&gt;September 2020&lt;/a&gt;). They lock large customers into prepaid, discounted, multi-year enterprise-wide agreements, and give startups $100,000s of free credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even with hundreds of thousands of employees and tens of billions of dollars in cash, the public clouds did not develop TimescaleDB, the Elastic Stack, the Confluent Platform, and countless other open-source projects. These were built by independent teams dedicated to advancing state-of-the-art technology and serving developers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is David vs. Goliath. The Rebel Alliance vs. the Empire. Entrepreneurial teams taking on the largest corporations in the world with new, innovative technology. Cloud Protection Licenses foster more innovation, and enable the open-source underdogs to compete against the public cloud giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/content/images/2020/09/luke-2-2.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-developers-like-and-not-like-about-the-initial-timescale-license&quot;&gt;What did developers like and not like about the initial Timescale License?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since we launched the TSL, the response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive. But over the years, the community has also provided really helpful feedback - via GitHub, Slack, Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit, email, etc. - which we have incorporated into this latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, an overwhelming majority has been supportive of the general direction of the TSL, understanding that offering a managed service is increasingly the primary commercialization approach for database and other infrastructure software providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think we're too hung up on OSI open source licenses. The additional restriction in the timescaledb license that you can't run a paid database as a service offering affects hardly anyone negatively (AWS). It affects us all positively by providing a sustainable business model to support additional development and support of an open-source product we use. Win-win if ever there was one. I'd like to see more open-source and closed-source companies consider this model.” (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23273191&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also heard some requests for liberalizing some of the terms of the Timescale License:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One of the important reasons I personally use and support open-source is the freedom to not only inspect (which the TSL provides) but to also not have to ask someone else and wait on them to make any changes I need to the software I use. Any chance the TSL can be modified to include this freedom too?” (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23274509&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don't care if I can see the source code if I can't actually _do_ anything with it. If I can't run my modifications in production, it doesn't guard me against vendor lock-in and it doesn't give me the right-to-repair.” (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23275143&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve listened to that feedback, and looked at where we are going as a company and how our direction lines up with our licensing. And, so we are pleased to announce changes that remove some restrictions of the TSL (and simplifies it in the process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;giving-more-rights-to-users-right-to-repair-and-right-to-improve&quot;&gt;Giving more rights to users: right-to-repair and right-to-improve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to our users and the general developer community, we are pleased to announce some changes to the Timescale License that loosen restrictions and provide expanded rights to users, reinforcing our commitment to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be perfectly clear: These changes solely give users&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;additional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;rights in how they can use and distribute TimescaleDB in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;scenarios; these changes do not further restrict any rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two biggest rights we are adding are the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“right-to-repair” and the “right-to-improve.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, users now have what some call the &lt;em&gt;“right-to-repair”&lt;/em&gt; with TimescaleDB. If they encounter any issue or bug that they want fixed immediately, they can find, fix, and deploy a fix locally before it might be released upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, users can now add additional features to TimescaleDB that might fit their own needs, and use their modified version for internal use, to build a SaaS service, or even when shipping code to users. Some call this the &lt;em&gt;“right-to-improve.”&lt;/em&gt; Previously, they would need to upstream this change back to TimescaleDB before deploying into production. That also meant (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23274989&quot;&gt;as Hacker News readers pointed out&lt;/a&gt;) that proposed enhancements couldn’t be run and hardened in production before being submitted upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, we had included these restrictions with good intentions: we wanted to incentivize developers to contribute bug fixes and enhancements upstream, so that the software would be improved for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also were concerned about the issues, uncertainty, and support burden that can arise from users running modified versions; we spend a significant amount of time helping answer questions for free in our large and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.timescale.com/&quot;&gt;active Slack community,&lt;/a&gt; which now numbers almost 5,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after hearing from the community, we’ve come to appreciate that the benefits of these rights outweigh their downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-goodbye-to-the-enterprise-tier-and-going-all-in-on-cloud-&quot;&gt;👋 Goodbye to the enterprise tier (and going all-in on cloud)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another big change we are making in the TSL: eliminating the enterprise tier altogether. &lt;strong&gt;This means that we are now making all of our software, everything licensed under Apache-2 and the TSL, available for free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, open-source businesses generally relied on commercial support and an enterprise tier (known as “open-core”) for commercialization. Timescale was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year, we have increasingly focused on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/fully-managed-time-series-data-service-now-available-in-aws-azure-gcp-75-regions-compare-vs-influxdb-timestream/&quot;&gt;managed cloud service&lt;/a&gt; as our primary commercialization strategy, and selling an enterprise edition of TimescaleDB for on-premise deployments (either on customers' own physical hardware or on their own cloud VMs) as our secondary commercialization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fully-managed cloud service is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/fully-managed-time-series-data-service-now-available-in-aws-azure-gcp-75-regions-compare-vs-influxdb-timestream/&quot;&gt;industry-leading service for time-series data&lt;/a&gt;, running on all three major clouds and available in more than 75 regions. The growth of our cloud business has enabled us to make it the centerpiece of our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This has simplified a key question that every open-source company has historically wrestled with: which of our features should we “hold back” from our free version and keep in the paid enterprise tier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, we would have difficult internal debates about new features: Release something to support our community and drive adoption? Or limit it to the enterprise tier to drive revenue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today we are going all-in on cloud, and removing any notion of paid enterprise capabilities from the Timescale License.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going “all-in” on cloud, our choice becomes simpler: make all features available for free, so that we can invest in our community. Users can then either self-manage for free (including use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-kubernetes&quot;&gt;open-source k8s helm charts&lt;/a&gt;), or use our managed cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this easy choice – and our ability to “support our community” while preserving Timescale’s long-term viability –  exists precisely because we have the Timescale License, which restricts cloud vendors’ ability to offer TSL software unless they first establish a business relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this thinking, earlier this summer, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-1-7-fast-continuous-aggregates-with-real-time-views-postgresql-12-support-and-more-community-features/&quot;&gt;moved most of our existing enterprise features into TimescaleDB’s free community tier&lt;/a&gt;. And with our upcoming TimescaleDB 2.0 release, we are moving the last enterprise features to the free community tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original Timescale License also allowed us to set potential “usage limits” on community features. The thinking was that, hypothetically, we might at some future time want to allow users to use multi-node TimescaleDB up to, say, 4 servers for free, but thereafter need an enterprise license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to how many SaaS services “tier” consumption under different levels of plans. But these usage limits were always hypothetical: we never released a TimescaleDB feature with usage limits. And internally, we never really liked the idea that users’ internal consumption could “expand” to a level where they would no longer be able to use TimescaleDB for free (even though sized-based pricing is fairly common to databases in the enterprise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So today, we are also removing any notion of community “usage limits” from the Timescale License.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-main-restriction-we-have-preserved-no-timescaledb-as-a-service&quot;&gt;The main restriction we have preserved: no TimescaleDB-as-a-service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we have preserved, however, is the main restriction preventing other companies from offering TimescaleDB-as-a-Service in the cloud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along a similar vein, we also don’t allow parties to “fork and modify” the database and redistribute this forked version to others, which could serve as a way to try to circumvent licensing restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concern isn’t hypothetical: Amazon, for example, has attempted to fork both the code and community of Elastic by releasing its own questionably-named “Open Distro for Elasticsearch” that re-implements some of Elastic’s key community features and licenses them instead as Apache-2 (while heavily monetizing these features as part of its managed Amazon Elasticsearch Service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shared earlier, this restriction is the heart of Cloud Protection Licenses like the TSL, and is what enables further innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-what-s-changing-and-isn-t-changing&quot;&gt;Summary: What’s changing and isn’t changing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s review the rights previously granted by the Timescale License, newly granted, expanded rights, and those that are still disallowed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To understand these changes, it’s important to understand the concept of “Value Added Service or Product”, which is a key part of the Timescale License (and can similarly be found in the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/licenses/ELASTIC-LICENSE.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elastic License&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confluent Community License&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notion of a Value Added Service or Product is that you are building something of value on top of TimescaleDB and not just “reselling” it as part of a “database” or “database-as-a-service”.  (The formal legal definition can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/legal/licenses#section-3-10-value-added-products-or-services&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Value Added Product or Service can certainly be commercial or proprietary; the TSL is in no way a “non-commercial” license. Many companies provide SaaS services using TimescaleDB as part of their service offering, or distribute commercial products embedding TimescaleDB. They just can’t purely offer “TimescaleDB-as-a-Service,” which is why cloud vendors like Amazon or Microsoft can’t and don’t offer the TSL parts of TimescaleDB as part of AWS RDS or Azure Postgres.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“utilize”: Offering code/product via a software-as-a-service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“distribute”: Shipping code/product via software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Value Added Service or Product”: Something of value on top of TimescaleDB and not just “reselling” TimescaleDB as part of a “database” or “database-as-a-service”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rights previously granted (and still allowed) under Timescale License&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right to run &lt;em&gt;unmodified&lt;/em&gt; TimescaleDB for internal use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to utilize &lt;em&gt;unmodified&lt;/em&gt; TimescaleDB to offer a Value Added Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to distribute &lt;em&gt;unmodified&lt;/em&gt; Source and Binaries as part of Value Added Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to modify TimescaleDB for internal development and testing, and subsequently upstream modifications to Timescale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rights newly granted (formerly disallowed) under Timescale License&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right to run &lt;em&gt;modified&lt;/em&gt; TimescaleDB for internal use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to utilize &lt;em&gt;modified&lt;/em&gt; TimescaleDB to offer a Value Added Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to distribute &lt;em&gt;modified&lt;/em&gt; Binaries as part of a Value Added Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right to distribute &lt;em&gt;unmodified&lt;/em&gt; Source and Binaries, even if not as part of Value Added Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rights still disallowed under Timescale License&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No right to utilize TimescaleDB for external use, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; as part of a Value Added Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No right to distribute modified Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No right to distribute modified Binaries, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; as part of a Value Added Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean-for-me&quot;&gt;What does this mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a current or future user of TimescaleDB, these changes mean that you have more rights. But if you are looking to provide TimescaleDB-as-a-service, you are still restricted to only offering the Apache-2 edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, by refreshing the Timescale License and focusing on our cloud service, we can continue to invest in our community by releasing our best features to be completely free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now these features include distributed hypertables in TimescaleDB 2.0 for even greater scale. Beta users have already been running multi-node TimescaleDB in continuous daily use for many months, including a 22-server cluster by a Fortune 50 company ingesting more than a billion rows per day. We’ll be writing more about TimescaleDB 2.0 when it launches (soon!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, you can deploy TimescaleDB on-premise or in your own cloud account&lt;/strong&gt;, running the software on bare VMs or using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-kubernetes&quot;&gt;open-source k8s helm charts&lt;/a&gt; which automate high-availability/failover and continuous PITR backups. Totally free to use, and now free to even modify for your own use or for services or products you build on TimescaleDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or, if you prefer, you can let us run TimescaleDB for you, fully managed on AWS, Azure, or GCP&lt;/strong&gt; in 75+ regions and with access to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/support&quot;&gt;top-rated support team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.timescale.com/&quot;&gt;join our 5,000+ member Slack community&lt;/a&gt; for any questions, to learn more, and to meet like-minded developers&lt;/strong&gt; – we’re active in all channels and here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leak reveals $2T of possibly corrupt US financial activity</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/20/leak-reveals-2tn-of-possibly-corrupt-us-financial-activity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/20/leak-reveals-2tn-of-possibly-corrupt-us-financial-activity</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Thousands of documents detailing $2 trillion (£1.55tn) of potentially corrupt transactions that were washed through the US financial system have been leaked to an international group of investigative journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The leak focuses on more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed with the US government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;sign-in-gate&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Banks and other financial institutions file SARs when they believe a client is using their services for potential criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;However, the filing of an SAR does not require the bank to cease doing business with the client in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The documents were provided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks?ref=bfnsplash&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;, which shared them with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The documents are said to suggest major banks provided financial services to high-risk individuals from around the world, in some cases even after they had been placed under sanctions by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;According to the ICIJ the documents relate to more than $2tn of transactions dating from between 1999 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;One of those named in the SARs is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/paul-manafort&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/a&gt;, a political strategist who led Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign for several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;He stepped down from the role after his consultancy work for former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych was exposed, and he was later convicted of fraud and tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;According to the ICIJ&lt;/a&gt;, banks began flagging activity linked to Manafort as suspicious beginning in 2012. In 2017 JP Morgan Chase filed a report on wire transfers worth over $300m involving shell companies in Cyprus that had done business with Manafort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The ICIJ said Manafort’s lawyer did not respond to an invitation to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;A separate report details over $1bn in wire transfers by JP Morgan Chase that the bank later came to suspect were linked to Semion Mogilevich, an alleged Russian organised crime boss who is named on the FBI’s top 10 most wanted list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;A JP Morgan Chase spokesperson told the BBC: “We follow all laws and regulations in support of the government’s work to combat financial crimes. We devote thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars to this important work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;HSBC said in a statement: “Starting in 2012, HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.” It added: “HSBC is a much safer institution than it was in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;“The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is aware that various media outlets intend to publish a series of articles based on unlawfully disclosed suspicious activity reports (SARs), as well as other sensitive government documents, from several years ago,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;“As FinCEN has stated previously, the unauthorised disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States, compromise law enforcement investigations, and threaten the safety and security of the institutions and individuals who file such reports.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL 13</title>
<link>https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2077/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2077/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on &lt;strong&gt;2020-09-24&lt;/strong&gt; by PostgreSQL Global Development Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL 13&lt;/a&gt;, the latest version of the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;most advanced open source database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 13 includes significant improvements to its indexing and lookup system that benefit large databases, including space savings and performance gains for indexes, faster response times for queries that use aggregates or partitions, better query planning when using enhanced statistics, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with highly requested features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-vacuum.html&quot;&gt;parallelized vacuuming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-INCREMENTAL-SORT&quot;&gt;incremental sorting&lt;/a&gt;, PostgreSQL 13 provides a better data management experience for workloads big and small, with optimizations for daily administration, more conveniences for application developers, and security enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;PostgreSQL 13 showcases the collaboration and dedication of our global community in furthering the abilities of the world's most advanced open source relational database,&quot; said Peter Eisentraut, a PostgreSQL Core Team member. &quot;The innovations that each release brings along with its reputation for reliability and stability is the reason why more people choose to use PostgreSQL for their applications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, an innovative data management system known for its reliability and robustness, benefits from over 25 years of open source development from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/community/&quot;&gt;global developer community&lt;/a&gt; and has become the preferred open source relational database for organizations of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continued Performance Gains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on work from the previous PostgreSQL release, PostgreSQL 13 can efficiently handle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION&quot;&gt;duplicate data in B-tree indexes&lt;/a&gt;, the standard database index. This lowers the overall space usage that B-tree indexes require while improving overall query performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 13 introduces incremental sorting, where sorted data from an earlier step in a query can accelerate sorting at a later step. Additionally, PostgreSQL can now use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/planner-stats.html#PLANNER-STATS-EXTENDED&quot;&gt;extended statistics&lt;/a&gt; system (accessed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createstatistics.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE STATISTICS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to create improved plans for queries with &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; clauses and &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ANY&lt;/code&gt; lookups over lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PostgreSQL 13, more types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-aggregate.html&quot;&gt;aggregate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS&quot;&gt;grouping set&lt;/a&gt; queries can leverage PostgreSQL’s efficient hash aggregation functionality, as queries with large aggregates do not have to fit entirely into memory. Queries with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-partitioning.html&quot;&gt;partitioned tables&lt;/a&gt; have received a performance boost, as there are now more cases where partitions can be pruned and where partitions can be directly joined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Administration Optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/routine-vacuuming.html&quot;&gt;Vacuuming&lt;/a&gt; is an essential part of PostgreSQL administration, enabling the database to reclaim storage space after rows are updated and deleted. This process can also present administrative challenges, though prior PostgreSQL releases have done work to ease the overhead of vacuuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 13 continues to improve the vacuuming system with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-vacuum.html&quot;&gt;parallelized vacuum for indexes&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the vacuuming performance benefits it offers, the use of this new feature can be tuned to specific workloads as administrators can select the number of parallel workers to run. In addition to these performance benefits, data inserts can now trigger the autovacuum process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-SLOTS&quot;&gt;Replication slots&lt;/a&gt;, which are used to prevent write-ahead logs (WAL) from being removed before they are received by a replica, can be tuned in PostgreSQL 13 to specify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-SLOT-WAL-KEEP-SIZE&quot;&gt;max number of WAL files to retain&lt;/a&gt; and help avoid out-of-disk errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 13 also adds more ways an administrator can monitor database activity, including referencing WAL usage statistics from &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/code&gt;, the progress of streaming base backups, and the progress of the &lt;code&gt;ANALYZE&lt;/code&gt; commands. Additionally, the integrity of the output of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgbasebackup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_basebackup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command can be checked using the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgverifybackup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_verifybackup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Application Development Conveniences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 13 makes it even easier to work with PostgreSQL data types coming from different data sources. This release adds the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-OP-TABLE&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;datetime()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function to its SQL/JSON path support, which converts valid time formats (e.g. ISO 8601 strings) to PostgreSQL-native types. Additionally, the UUID v4 generation function, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-uuid.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gen_random_uuid()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is now available without having to install any extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL’s partitioning system is more flexible, as partitioned tables fully support logical replication and BEFORE row-level triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-select.html#SQL-LIMIT&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FETCH FIRST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; syntax in PostgreSQL 13 is now expanded to include the &lt;code&gt;WITH TIES&lt;/code&gt; clause. When specified, &lt;code&gt;WITH TIES&lt;/code&gt; includes any rows that, based on the &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; clause, &quot;tie&quot; with the last row in the result set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Security Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL’s extension system is a key component of its robustness as it allows developers to expand its functionality. In previous releases, new extensions could only be installed by a database superuser. To make it easier to take advantage of PostgreSQL’s extensibility, PostgreSQL 13 adds the concept of a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createextension.html&quot;&gt;trusted extension&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which allows database users to install extensions that a superuser marks as &quot;trusted.&quot; Certain built-in extensions are marked as trusted by default, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/pgcrypto.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgcrypto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/tablefunc.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tablefunc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/hstore.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hstore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For applications that require secure authentication methods, PostgreSQL 13 allows for clients to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-CHANNEL-BINDING&quot;&gt;require channel binding&lt;/a&gt; when using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sasl-authentication.html#SASL-SCRAM-SHA-256&quot;&gt;SCRAM authentication&lt;/a&gt;, and the PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/postgres-fdw.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgres_fdw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) can now use certificate-based authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About PostgreSQL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; is the world's most advanced open source database, with a global community of thousands of users, contributors, companies and organizations. Built on over 30 years of engineering, starting at the University of California, Berkeley, PostgreSQL has continued with an unmatched pace of development. PostgreSQL's mature feature set not only matches top proprietary database systems, but exceeds them in advanced database features, extensibility, security, and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate in Mumbai, India, Saad Bhamla wanted to do something nice for his maternal grandparents: Buy them a pair of hearing aids. But the prices were shockingly high—and far beyond his means. Now, 15 years later, the bioengineer has invented a device to help grandparents across the globe: a do-it-yourself hearing aid made from inexpensive, easy-to-find parts. The no-frills device, described in a new study, could help restore hearing to millions suffering from age-related hearing loss—for less than the price of a bottle of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new device is “incredibly compelling,” says Frank Lin, an ear, nose, and throat doctor at the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, 230 million people aged 65 and older experience age-related hearing loss. Typically, high-pitch sounds become harder to distinguish, like electronic beeps and speech sounds such as “s” and “th.” Conversations can seem mumbled, and background noise feels distracting and invasive. Such deficiencies can be isolating, Lin says, and his research suggests &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21728425/&quot;&gt;they can also accelerate cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To regain their abilities, many seniors turn to hearing aids. Custom hearing aids amplify sound in the exact frequencies that the listener cannot hear. But at nearly $5000 a pair, these devices are “practically a luxury item” for many in low- and middle-income countries, says Bhamla, who specializes in “frugal science” at Georgia Institute of Technology. Lower grade hearing aids are cheaper, but they can’t be customized, and they still cost up to $500. They’re like “cheap earphones in an airplane,” Bhamla says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his grandparents and a hearing-impaired colleague—who is first author on the new paper—Bhamla and his team set out to develop a cheap hearing aid built with off-the-shelf parts. They soldered a microphone onto a small circuit board to capture nearby sound and added an amplifier and a frequency filter to specifically increase the volume of high-pitch sounds above 1000 hertz. Then they added a volume control, an on/off switch, and an audio jack for plugging in standard earphones, as well as a battery holder. The device, dubbed LoCHAid, is the size of a matchbox and can be worn like a necklace. At bulk rates, Bhamla says, it would cost just under $1 to make. But anyone with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bhamla-lab/LoCHAid-2020-PLOS-ONE&quot;&gt;freely available blueprints&lt;/a&gt; and a soldering iron can make their own for not much more—maybe $15 or $20, Bhamla says. The parts are easy to source, he says, and putting them together takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0gnbOJ3nDo&quot;&gt;less than 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Bhamla and his colleagues tested the device. They found that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238922&quot;&gt;boosted the volume of high-pitch sounds&lt;/a&gt; by 15 decibels while preserving volumes at lower pitches. It also filtered out interference and sudden, loud sounds like dog barks and car horns. Finally, tests with an artificial ear revealed that LoCHAid might improve speech recognition, by bringing conversations closer to the quality heard by healthy individuals. It complied with five out of six of the World Health Organization’s preferred product recommendations for hearing aids, the researchers report today in &lt;cite&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its simplicity has a few drawbacks, however. The device can’t be fine-tuned for individual needs or adapted to treat other hearing issues. And even though it’s waterproof and shock resistant, the scientists anticipate that LoCHAid’s parts will wear out after about a year and a half. Its bulky size might deter some users, Bhamla says, although a smaller version is in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But engineering is only half the battle. Until LoCHAid is clinically tested, it cannot be sold as a “hearing aid” in most countries—including the United States. Ultimately, Bhamla wants to get an approval to sell the device over the counter without a prescription, like ibuprofen or reading glasses. “It’s something we’re still figuring out,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is getting people to use the devices. In low- and middle-income countries, only 3% of people with age-related hearing loss wear hearing aids, and in countries like the United States, the adoption rate hovers at about 20%, according to Bhamla. Aside from concerns about cost, Bhamla says, “a lot of people don’t realize they have hearing loss … and then there’s the social stigma of wearing the aid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if these cheap, colorful devices take off, they could benefit many people on the brink of cognitive decline, Lin says. “Theoretically, if you treat hearing loss, you might modify those pathways and reduce the risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhamla wants biomedical devices to be as cheap and accessible as consumer electronics. He still remembers the shock of learning that he couldn’t afford to help his grandparents. “I thought owning a laptop and a cellphone meant I had the means to buy hearing aids, but then I realized how expensive they were,” he recalls. “It was sobering.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Hearing Day 16</title>
<link>https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-16/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-16/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday the trap sprang shut, as Judge Baraitser insisted the witnesses must finish next week, and that no time would be permitted for preparation of closing arguments, which must be heard the immediate following Monday. This brought the closest the defence have come to a protest, with the defence pointing out they have still not addressed the new superseding indictment, and that the judge refused their request for an adjournment before witness hearings started, to give them time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Fitzgerald QC for the defence also pointed out that there had been numerous witnesses whose evidence had to be taken into account, and the written closing submissions had to be physically prepared with reference to the transcripts and other supporting evidence from the trial. Baraitser countered that the defence had given her 200 pages of opening argument and she did not see that much more could be needed. Fitzgerald, who is an old fashioned gentleman in the very nicest sense of those words, struggled to express his puzzlement that all of the evidence since opening arguments could be dismissed as unnecessary and of no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear that all over London a very hard rain is now falling on those who for a lifetime have worked within institutions of liberal democracy that at least broadly and usually used to operate within the governance of their own professed principles. It has been clear to me from Day 1 that I am watching a charade unfold. It is not in the least a shock to me that Baraitser does not think anything beyond the written opening arguments has any effect. I have again and again reported to you that, where rulings have to be made, she has brought them into court pre-written, before hearing the arguments before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly expect the final decision was made in this case even before opening arguments were received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan of the US Government throughout has been to limit the information available to the public and limit the effective access to a wider public of what information is available. Thus we have seen the extreme restrictions on both physical and video access. A complicit mainstream media has ensured those of us who know what is happening are very few in the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my blog has never been so systematically subject to shadowbanning from Twitter and Facebook as now. Normally about 50% of my blog readers arrive from Twitter and 40% from Facebook. During the trial it has been 3% from Twitter and 9% from Facebook. That is a fall from 90% to 12%. In the February hearings Facebook and Twitter were between them sending me over 200,000 readers a day. Now they are between them sending me 3,000 readers a day. To be plain that is very much less than my normal daily traffic from them just in ordinary times. It is the insidious nature of this censorship that is especially sinister – people believe they have successfully shared my articles on Twitter and Facebook, while those corporations hide from them that in fact it went into nobody’s timeline. My own family have not been getting their notifications of my posts on either platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Government responded to Baraitser’s pronouncement enthusiastically with the suggestion that closing arguments did not ought to be heard AT ALL. They ought merely to be submitted in writing, perhaps a week after final witnesses. Baraitser appeared eager to agree with this. A ruling is expected today. Let me add that two days ago I noticed the defence really had missed an important moment to stand up to her, when the direction of her railroading became evident. It appears that because of the ground the defence already conceded at that stage, Noam Chomsky is one of the witnesses from whom we now will not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid I am not going to give you a substantive account of Wednesday’s witnesses. I have decided that the intimate details of Julian’s medical history and condition ought not to be subject to further public curiosity. I know I cannot call back what others have published – and the court is going to consider press requests for the entire medical records before it. But I have to do what I believe is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that for the defence, &lt;strong&gt;Dr Quinton Deeley&lt;/strong&gt; appeared. Dr Deeley is Senior Lecturer in Social Behaviour and Neurodevelopment at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience (IOPPN), King’s College London and Consultant Neuropsychiatrist in the National Autism Unit. He is co-author of the Royal College Report on the Management of Autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Deeley after overseeing the standard test and extensive consultation with Julian Assange and tracing of history, had made a clear diagnosis which encompassed Asperger’s. He described Julian as high-functioning autistic. There followed the usual disgraceful display by James Lewis QC, attempting to pick apart the diagnosis trait by trait, and employing such tactics as “well, you are not looking me in the eye, so does that make you autistic?”. He really did. I am not making this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say more about Lewis, who is a strange character. Privately very affable, he adopts a tasteless and impolite aggression in cross-examination that looks very unusual indeed. He adopts peculiar postures. After asking aggressive questions, he strikes poses of theatrical pugilism. For example he puts arms akimbo, thrusts out his chin, and bounces himself up on his feet to the extent that his heels actually leave the floor, while looking round at the courtroom in apparent triumph, his gaze pausing to fix that of the judge occasionally. These gestures almost always involve throwing back one or both front panels of his jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is some kind of unconscious alpha male signalling in progress, and all these psychiatrists around might link it to his lack of height. It is display behaviour but not really very successful. Lewis has grown a full set during lockdown and he appears strikingly like a chorus matelot in a small town production of HMS Pinafore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large part of me that wants to give details of the cross-examination because Deeley handled Lewis superbly, giving calm and reasoned replies and not conceding anything to Lewis’s clumsy attempts to dismantle his diagnosis. Lewis effectively argued Julian’s achievements would be impossible with autism while Deeley differed. But there is no way to retell it without going into the discussion of medical detail I do not wish to give. I will however tell you that Julian’s father John told me that Julian has long known he has Asperger’s and will cheerfully say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second psychiatrist on Wednesday, &lt;strong&gt;Dr Seena Fazel&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of Forensic Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, was the first prosecution witness we have heard from. He struck me as an honest and conscientious man and made reasonable points, well. There was a great deal of common ground between Prof Fazel and the defence psychiatrists, and I think it is fair to say that his major point was that Julian’s future medical state would depend greatly on the conditions he was held in with regard to isolation, and on hope or despair dependent on his future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Lewis was keen to paint an Elysian picture. As ever, he fell back on the affidavit of US Assistant attorney Gordon Kromberg, who described the holiday camp that is the ADX maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, where the prosecution say Julian will probably be incarcerated on conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1246.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;898&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-60628&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1246.png 505w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1246-169x300.png 169w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will recall this is the jail that was described as a “living hell” and a “fate worse than death” by its own warden. Lewis invited Prof Fazel to agree this regime would not cause medical problems for Julian, and to his credit Prof Fazel, despite being a prosecution witness, declined to be used in this way, saying that it would be necessary to find out how many of Kromberg’s claims were true in practice, and what was the quality of this provision. Fazel was unwilling to buy in to lies about this notorious facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis was disingenuous because he knows, and the prosecution have conceded, that if convicted Julian would most likely be kept in H block at the ADX under “Special Administrative Measures.” If he had read on a few paragraphs in Kromberg’s affidavit he would have come to the regime Julian would actually be held under:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1248.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;487&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-60632&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1248.png 487w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1248-222x300.png 222w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us be clear about this. William Barr decides who is subjected to this regime and when it may be ameliorated. For at least the first twelve months you are in solitary confinement locked in your cell, and allowed out only three times a week just to shower. You are permitted no visits and two phone calls a month. After twelve months this can be ameliorated – and we will hear evidence this is rare – to allow three phone calls a month, and brief release from the cell five times a week to exercise, still in absolute isolation. We have heard evidence this exercise period is usually around 3am. After an indeterminate number of years you may, or may not, be allowed to meet another human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind Baraitser’s chilly disdain, behind Lewis’s theatrical postures, this hell on Earth is what these people are planning to do to Julian. They are calmly discussing how definitely it will kill him, in full knowledge that it is death in life in any event. I sit in the public gallery, perched eight feet above them all, watching the interaction of the characters in this masque, as the lawyers pile up their bundles of papers or stare into their laptops, as Lewis and Fitzgerald exchange pleasantries, as the friendly clerks try to make the IT systems work, and my mind swims in horrified disbelief. They are discussing a fate for my friend as horrible as that of the thousands who over 500 years were dragged from this very spot and strung up outside. They are all chatting and working away as though we were a normal part of civilised society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I go back to my hotel room, type it all up and post it. The governments who are destroying Julian have through their agencies pushed the huge corporations who now control the major internet traffic gateways, to ensure my pained and grieving account is seen by very few. My screams of pain and horror are deadened by thick padded walls. We are all locked in.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Your Man in the Public Gallery: Assange Hearing Day 16 - Craig Murray</og:title>
<og:description>On Wednesday the trap sprang shut, as Judge Baraitser insisted the witnesses must finish next week, and that no time would be permitted for preparation of closing arguments, which must be heard the immediate following Monday. This brought the closest the defence have come to a protest, with the defence pointing out they have still […]</og:description>
