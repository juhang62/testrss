<description>&lt;p&gt;Great civilisations are not murdered. Instead, they take their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- callout-box start --&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;callout-box-body&quot; readability=&quot;36.821917808219&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This article is part of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/deep-civilisation&quot;&gt;new BBC Future series about the long view of humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which aims to stand back from the daily news cycle and widen the lens of our current place in time. Modern society is suffering from “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=utkyW3MzDJMC&amp;amp;lpg=PA110&amp;amp;ots=zASGGoV8_v&amp;amp;dq=elise%20boulding%20temporal%20exhaustion&amp;amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=elise%20boulding%20temporal%20exhaustion&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;temporal exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”, the sociologist Elise Boulding once said. “If one is mentally out of breath all the time from dealing with the present, there is no energy left for imagining the future,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why the Deep Civilisation season will explore what really matters in the broader arc of human history and what it means for us and our descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- callout-box end --&gt;&lt;p&gt;So concluded the historian Arnold Toynbee in his 12-volume magnum opus A Study of History. It was an exploration of the rise and fall of 28 different civilisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was right in some respects: civilisations are often responsible for their own decline. However, their self-destruction is usually assisted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roman Empire, for example, was the victim of many ills including overexpansion, climatic change, environmental degradation and poor leadership. But it was also brought to its knees when Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 and the Vandals in 455.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collapse is often quick and greatness provides no immunity. The Roman Empire covered 4.4 million sq km (1.9 million sq miles) in 390. Five years later, it had plummeted to 2 million sq km (770,000 sq miles). By 476, the empire’s reach was zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our deep past is marked by recurring failure. As part of my research at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, I am attempting to find out why collapse occurs through a historical autopsy. What can the rise and fall of historic civilisations tell us about our own? What are the forces that precipitate or delay a collapse? And do we see similar patterns today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might also like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way to look at past civilisations is to compare their longevity. This can be difficult, because there is no strict definition of civilisation, nor an overarching database of their births and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the graphic below, I have compared the lifespan of various civilisations, which I define as a society with agriculture, multiple cities, military dominance in its geographical region and a continuous political structure. Given this definition, all empires are civilisations, but not all civilisations are empires. The data is drawn from two studies on the growth and decline of empires (for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0049089X78900108&quot;&gt;3000-600BC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170959?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents&quot;&gt;600BC-600&lt;/a&gt;), and an informal, crowd-sourced &lt;a href=&quot;https://owlcation.com/humanities/How-long-do-empires-last&quot;&gt;survey of ancient civilisations&lt;/a&gt; (which I have amended).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p0715m80.png&quot; alt=&quot;“Historic&quot; civilisations=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click/pinch to enlarge. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190218-the-lifespans-of-ancient-civilisations-compared&quot;&gt;Here's the full list of the civilisations displayed above.&lt;/a&gt; (Credit: Nigel Hawtin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collapse can be defined as a rapid and enduring loss of population, identity and socio-economic complexity. Public services crumble and disorder ensues as government loses control of its monopoly on violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all past civilisations have faced this fate. Some recovered or transformed, such as the Chinese and Egyptian. Other collapses were permanent, as was the case of Easter Island. Sometimes the cities at the epicentre of collapse are revived, as was the case with Rome. In other cases, such as the Mayan ruins, they are left abandoned as a mausoleum for future tourists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can this tell us about the future of global modern civilisation? Are the lessons of agrarian empires applicable to our post-18th Century period of industrial capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collapse may be a normal phenomenon for civilisations, regardless of their size and technological stage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that they are. Societies of the past and present are just complex systems composed of people and technology. The theory of “normal accidents” suggests that complex technological systems regularly give way to failure. So collapse may be a normal phenomenon for civilisations, regardless of their size and stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may be more technologically advanced now. But this gives little ground to believe that we are immune to the threats that undid our ancestors. Our newfound technological abilities even bring new, unprecedented challenges to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while our scale may now be global, collapse appears to happen to both sprawling empires and fledgling kingdoms alike. There is no reason to believe that greater size is armour against societal dissolution. Our tightly-coupled, globalised economic system is, if anything, more likely to make crisis spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fate of previous civilisations can be a roadmap to our future, what does it say? One method is to examine the trends that preceded historic collapses and see how they are unfolding today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no single accepted theory for why collapses happen, historians, anthropologists and others have proposed various explanations, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIMATIC CHANGE: &lt;/strong&gt;When climatic stability changes, the results can be disastrous, resulting in crop failure, starvation and desertification. The collapse of the Anasazi, the Tiwanaku civilisation, the Akkadians, the Mayan, the Roman Empire, and many others have all coincided with abrupt climatic changes, usually droughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION: &lt;/strong&gt;Collapse can occur when societies overshoot the carrying capacity of their environment. This ecological collapse theory, which has been the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jNQd9RpuJ-4C&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=collapse+jared+diamond+bbc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwij9Y-y1LPgAhXnRBUIHRh2DVEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;bestselling books&lt;/a&gt;, points to excessive deforestation, water pollution, soil degradation and the loss of biodiversity as precipitating causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INEQUALITY AND OLIGARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;: Wealth and political inequality can be central drivers of social disintegration, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Radical_Transformation.html?id=x3VZDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;can oligarchy and centralisation of power&lt;/a&gt; among leaders. This not only causes social distress, but handicaps a society’s ability to respond to ecological, social and economic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of cliodynamics models how factors such as equality and demography correlate with political violence. Statistical analysis of previous societies suggests that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/human-cycles-history-as-science-1.11078&quot;&gt;happens in cycles&lt;/a&gt;. As population increases, the supply of labour outstrips demand, workers become cheap and society becomes top-heavy. This inequality undermines collective solidarity and political turbulence follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMPLEXITY: &lt;/strong&gt;Collapse expert and historian Joseph Tainter has proposed that societies eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=YdW5wSPJXIoC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=tainter+collapse&amp;amp;ots=OJJUnhQer_&amp;amp;sig=AHslul9mziZjLJodJaLbxqEPwnA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=tainter%20collapse&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;collapse under the weight&lt;/a&gt; of their own accumulated complexity and bureaucracy. Societies are problem-solving collectives that grow in complexity in order to overcome new issues. However, the returns from complexity eventually reach a point of diminishing returns. After this point, collapse will eventually ensue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another measure of increasing complexity is called Energy Return on Investment (EROI). This refers to the ratio between the amount of energy produced by a resource relative to the energy needed to obtain it. Like complexity, EROI appears to have a point of diminishing returns. In his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://homerdixon.com/writing/books/the-upside-of-down/&quot;&gt;The Upside of Down&lt;/a&gt;, the political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon observed that environmental degradation throughout the Roman Empire led to falling EROI from their staple energy source: crops of wheat and alfalfa. The empire fell alongside their EROI. Tainter also blames it as a chief culprit of collapse, including for the Mayan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTERNAL SHOCKS: &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, the “four horsemen”: war, natural disasters, famine and plagues. The Aztec Empire, for example, was brought to an end by Spanish invaders. Most early agrarian states were fleeting due to deadly epidemics. The concentration of humans and cattle in walled settlements with poor hygiene made disease outbreaks unavoidable and catastrophic. Sometimes disasters combined, as was the case with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/106740v2&quot;&gt;Spanish introducing salmonella&lt;/a&gt; to the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RANDOMNESS/BAD LUCK: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4bbf/b77db6ef43649c998757cf77d9258dabc010.pdf&quot;&gt;Statistical analysis on empires&lt;/a&gt; suggests that collapse is random and independent of age. Evolutionary biologist and data scientist Indre Zliobaite and her colleagues have observed a similar pattern in the evolutionary record of species. A common explanation of this apparent randomness is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24656&quot;&gt;“Red Queen Effect”&lt;/a&gt;: if species are constantly fighting for survival in a changing environment with numerous competitors, extinction is a consistent possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the abundance of books and articles, we don’t have a conclusive explanation as to why civilisations collapse. What we do know is this: the factors highlighted above can all contribute. Collapse is a tipping point phenomena, when compounding stressors overrun societal coping capacity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can examine these indicators of danger to see if our chance of collapse is falling or rising. Here are four of those possible metrics, measured over the past few decades:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/&quot;&gt;Temperature&lt;/a&gt; is a clear metric for climate change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD&quot;&gt;GDP is a proxy&lt;/a&gt; for complexity and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/&quot;&gt;the ecological footprint&lt;/a&gt; is an indicator for environmental degradation. Each of these has been trending steeply upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inequality is more difficult to calculate. The typical measurement of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI&quot;&gt;Gini Index suggests that inequality&lt;/a&gt; has decreased slightly globally (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/increasingly-inequality-within-not-across-countries-rising&quot;&gt;although it is increasing within countries&lt;/a&gt;). However, the Gini Index can be misleading as it only measures relative changes in income. In other words, if two individuals earning $1 and $100,000 both doubled their income, the Gini would show no change. But the gap between the two would have jumped from $99,999 to $198,998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I have also depicted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wid.world/&quot;&gt;income share of the global top 1%.&lt;/a&gt; The 1% have increased in their share of global income from approximately 16% in 1980 to over 20% today. Importantly, wealth inequality is even worse. The share of global wealth from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25462.pdf&quot;&gt;1% has swelled&lt;/a&gt; from 25-30% in the 1980s to approximately 40% in 2016. The reality is likely to be starker as these numbers do not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25462.pdf&quot;&gt;capture wealth and income siphoned&lt;/a&gt; into overseas tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that the EROI for fossil fuels has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856&quot;&gt;steadily decreasing over time&lt;/a&gt; as the easiest to reach and richest reserves are depleted. Unfortunately, most renewable replacements, such as solar, have a markedly lower EROI, largely due to their energy density and the rare earth metals and manufacturing required to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led much of the literature to discuss the possibility of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21332492&quot;&gt;“energy cliff”&lt;/a&gt; as EROI declines to a point where current societal levels of affluence can no longer be maintained. The energy cliff &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v146y2018icp722-729.html&quot;&gt;need not be terminal&lt;/a&gt; if renewable technologies continue to improve and energy efficiency measures are speedily implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measures of resilience &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The somewhat reassuring news is that collapse metrics are not the entire picture. Societal resilience may be able to delay or prevent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, globally “economic diversity” – a measurement of the diversity and sophistication of country exports ­– is greater today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s, as measured by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/rankings/country/eci/&quot;&gt;Economic Complexity Index&lt;/a&gt; (ECI). Nations are, on average, less reliant on single types of exports than they once were. For example, a nation that had diversified beyond only exporting agricultural products would be more likely to weather ecological degradation or the loss of trading partners. The ECI also measures the knowledge-intensity of exports. More skilled populations may have a greater capacity to respond to crises as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are some reasons to be optimistic, thanks to our ability to innovate and diversify away from disaster. Yet the world is worsening in areas that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, innovation – as measured by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.wipo.int/ipstats/index.htm?tab=patent&quot;&gt;per capita patent applications&lt;/a&gt; – is also rising. In theory, a civilisation might be less vulnerable to collapse if new technologies can mitigate against pressures such as climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that “collapse” can happen without violent catastrophe. As Rachel Nuwer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170418-how-western-civilisation-could-collapse&quot;&gt;wrote on BBC Future in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, “in some cases, civilisations simply fade out of existence – becoming the stuff of history not with a bang but a whimper”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when we look at all these collapse and resilience indicators as a whole, the message is clear that we should not be complacent. There are some reasons to be optimistic, thanks to our ability to innovate and diversify away from disaster. Yet the world is worsening in areas that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies. The climate is changing, the gap between the rich and poor is widening, the world is becoming increasingly complex, and our demands on the environment are outstripping planetary carrying capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rungless ladder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not all. Worryingly, the world is now deeply interconnected and interdependent. In the past, collapse was confined to regions – it was a temporary setback, and people often could easily return to agrarian or hunter-gatherer lifestyles. For many, it was even a welcome reprieve from the oppression of early states. Moreover, the weapons available during social disorder were rudimentary: swords, arrows and occasionally guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, societal collapse is a more treacherous prospect. The weapons available to a state, and sometimes even groups, during a breakdown now range from biological agents to nuclear weapons. New instruments of violence, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150715-killer-robots-the-soldiers-that-never-sleep&quot;&gt;lethal autonomous weapons&lt;/a&gt;, may be available in the near future. People are increasingly specialised and disconnected from the production of food and basic goods. And a changing climate may irreparably damage our ability to return to simple farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we may have already reached this point of civilisational “terminal velocity”. Any collapse – any fall from the ladder – risks being permanent. Nuclear war in itself could result in an existential risk: either the extinction of our species, or a permanent catapult back to the Stone Age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we are becoming more economically powerful and resilient, our technological capabilities also present unprecedented threats that no civilisation has had to contend with. For example, the climatic changes we face are of a different nature to what undid the Maya or Anazasi. They are global, human-driven, quicker, and more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistance in our self-imposed ruin will not come from hostile neighbors, but from our own technological powers. Collapse, in our case, would be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-History-Progress-Ronald-Wright/dp/1841958301&quot;&gt;progress trap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of our civilisation is not inevitable. History suggests it is likely, but we have the unique advantage of being able to learn from the wreckages of societies past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know what needs to be done: emissions can be reduced, inequalities levelled, environmental degradation reversed, innovation unleashed and economies diversified. The policy proposals are there. Only the political will is lacking. We can also invest in recovery. There are already well-developed ideas for improving the ability of &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What.html?id=zP2cBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Knowledge.html?id=MCNGAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; systems to be recuperated after catastrophe. Avoiding the creation of dangerous and widely-accessible technologies is also critical. Such steps will lessen the chance of a future collapse becoming irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will only march into collapse if we advance blindly. We are only doomed if we are unwilling to listen to the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cser.ac.uk/team/luke-kemp/&quot;&gt;Luke Kemp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a researcher based at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

<title>HIV Is Reported Cured in a Second Patient</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/health/aids-cure-london-patient.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/health/aids-cure-london-patient.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For just the second time since the global epidemic began, a patient appears to have been cured of infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The news comes nearly 12 years to the day after the first patient known to be cured, a feat that researchers have long tried, and failed, to duplicate. The surprise success now confirms that a cure for H.I.V. infection is possible, if difficult, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The investigators are to publish their report on Tuesday in the journal Nature and to present some of the details at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Publicly, the scientists are describing the case as a long-term remission. In interviews, most experts are calling it a cure, with the caveat that it is hard to know how to define the word when there are only two known instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Both milestones resulted from bone-marrow transplants given to infected patients. But the transplants were intended to treat cancer in the patients, not H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Bone-marrow transplantation is unlikely to be a realistic treatment option in the near future. Powerful drugs are now available to control H.I.V. infection, while the transplants are risky, with harsh side effects that can last for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But rearming the body with immune cells similarly modified to resist H.I.V. might well succeed as a practical treatment, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This will inspire people that cure is not a dream,” said Dr. Annemarie Wensing, a virologist at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. “It’s reachable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Wensing is co-leader of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icistem.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IciStem&lt;/a&gt;, a consortium of European scientists studying stem cell transplants to treat H.I.V. infection. The consortium is supported by AMFAR, the American AIDS research organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new patient has chosen to remain anonymous, and the scientists referred to him only as the “London patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I feel a sense of responsibility to help the doctors understand how it happened so they can develop the science,” he told The New York Times in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Learning that he could be cured of both cancer and H.I.V. infection was “surreal” and “overwhelming,” he added. “I never thought that there would be a cure during my lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the same conference in 2007, a German doctor described the first such cure in the “Berlin patient,” later identified as Timothy Ray Brown, 52, who now lives in Palm Springs, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That news, displayed on a poster at the back of a conference room, initially gained little attention. Once it became clear that Mr. Brown was cured, scientists set out to duplicate his result with other cancer patients infected with H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In case after case, the virus came roaring back, often around nine months after the patients stopped taking antiretroviral drugs, or else the patients died of cancer. The failures left scientists wondering whether Mr. Brown’s cure would remain a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Brown had had leukemia, and after chemotherapy failed to stop it, needed two bone-marrow transplants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The transplants were from a donor with a mutation in a protein called CCR5, which rests on the surface of certain immune cells. H.I.V. uses the protein to enter those cells but cannot latch on to the mutated version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Brown was given harsh immunosuppressive drugs of a kind that are no longer used, and suffered intense complications for months after the transplant. He was placed in an induced coma at one point and nearly died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Timothy Ray Brown, the first person to be cured of H.I.V., almost died during the treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grant Hindsley for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“He was really beaten up by the whole procedure,” said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who has treated Mr. Brown. “And so we’ve always wondered whether all that conditioning, a massive amount of destruction to his immune system, explained why Timothy was cured but no one else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The London patient has answered that question: A near-death experience is not required for the procedure to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He had Hodgkin’s lymphoma and received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with the CCR5 mutation in May 2016. He, too, received immunosuppressive drugs, but the treatment was much less intense, in line with current standards for transplant patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He quit taking anti-H.I.V. drugs in September 2017, making him the first patient since Mr. Brown known to remain virus-free for more than a year after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think this does change the game a little bit,” said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at University College London who presented the findings at the Seattle meeting. “Everybody believed after the Berlin patient that you needed to nearly die basically to cure H.I.V., but now maybe you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Although the London patient was not as ill as Mr. Brown had been after the transplant, the procedure worked about as well: The transplant destroyed the cancer without harmful side effects. The transplanted immune cells, now resistant to H.I.V., seem to have fully replaced his vulnerable cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most people with the H.I.V.-resistant mutation, called delta 32, are of Northern European descent. IciStem maintains a database of about 22,000 such donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So far, its scientists are tracking 38 H.I.V.-infected people who have received bone-marrow transplants, including &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2707334/mechanisms-contribute-profound-reduction-hiv-1-reservoir-after-allogeneic-stem&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;six from donors without the mutation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The London patient is 36 on this list. Another one, number 19 on the list and referred to as the “Düsseldorf patient,” has been off anti-H.I.V. drugs for four months. Details of that case will be presented at the Seattle conference later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The consortium’s scientists have repeatedly analyzed the London patient’s blood for signs of the virus. They saw a weak indication of continued infection in one of 24 tests, but say this may be the result of contamination in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The most sensitive test did not find any circulating virus. Antibodies to H.I.V. were still present in his blood, but their levels declined over time, in a trajectory similar to that seen in Mr. Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;None of this guarantees that the London patient is forever out of the woods, but the similarities to Mr. Brown’s recovery offer reason for optimism, Dr. Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“In a way, the only person to compare with directly is the Berlin patient,” he said. “That’s kind of the only standard we have at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Timothy Ray Brown, the first person to be cured of H.I.V., and Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist, speak on the second patient who appears to have been cured of an H.I.V. infection. That patient has chosen to remain anonymous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;emkp2hg2 css-1nwzsjy e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jane Stockdale for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most experts who know the details agree that the new case seems like a legitimate cure, but some are uncertain of its relevance for AIDS treatment overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m not sure what this tells us,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It was done with Timothy Ray Brown, and now here’s another case — ok, so now what? Now where do we go with it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One possibility, said Dr. Deeks and others, is to develop gene-therapy approaches to knock out CCR5 on immune cells or their predecessor stem cells. Resistant to H.I.V. infection, these modified cells should eventually clear the body of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;(CCR5 is the protein that He Jiankui, a scientist in China, claimed to have modified with gene editing in at least two children, in an attempt to make them resistant to H.I.V. — an experiment that set off international condemnation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Several companies are pursuing gene therapies but have not yet been successful. The modification must target the right number of cells, in the right place — only the bone marrow, for example, and not the brain — and tweak only the genes directing production of CCR5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There are a number of levels of precision that must be reached,” said Dr. Mike McCune, a senior adviser on global health to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “There are also concerns that you might do something untoward, and if so you might wish to have a kill switch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Several teams are working on all of these obstacles, Dr. McCune said. Eventually, they may be able to develop a viral delivery system that, when injected into the body, seeks out all CCR5 receptors and deletes them, or even a donor stem cell that is resistant to H.I.V. but could be given to any patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These are dreams, right? Things on the drawing table,” Dr. McCune said. “These dreams are motivated by cases like this — it helps us to imagine what might be done in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One important caveat to any such approach is that the patient would still be vulnerable to a form of H.I.V. called X4, which employs a different protein, CXCR4, to enter cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is only going to work if someone has a virus that really only uses CCR5 for entry — and that’s actually probably about 50 percent of the people who are living with H.I.V., if not less,” said Dr. Timothy J. Henrich, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even if a person harbors only a small number of X4 viruses, they may multiply in the absence of competition from their viral cousins. There is at least &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1405805&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one reported case&lt;/a&gt; of an individual who got a transplant from a delta 32 donor but later rebounded with the X4 virus. (As a precaution against X4, Mr. Brown is taking a daily pill to prevent H.I.V. infection.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Brown says he is hopeful that the London patient’s cure proves as durable as his own. “If something has happened once in medical science, it can happen again,” Mr. Brown said. “I’ve been waiting for company for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered a bug that would let any web page identify a logged in FB user by confirming their ID. Facebook fixed in 6-9 months and rewarded a $1000 bounty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last years coverage of the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica privacy concerns, Mark Zuckerberg was asked to testify before Congress, and one of the questions they asked was around whether Facebook could track users even on other websites. There was a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-tracking-internet-safety-security-privacy-mark-zuckerberg-latest-a8308446.html&quot;&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt; around this aspect of Facebook, and a lot of people were up in arms. As one aspect of their response, Facebook launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-abuse-bounty/&quot;&gt;Data Abuse Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of protecting user data from abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having recently found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/google-xml-sitemap-auth-bypass-black-hat-seo-bug-bounty/&quot;&gt;bug in Google’s search engine&lt;/a&gt;, I set out to see whether &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; could track or identify Facebook users when they were on other sites. After a few false starts, I managed to find a bug which &lt;strong&gt;allows me to identify whether a visitor is logged in to a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; account, and can check hundreds of identities per second (in the range of 500 p/s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/security/fb_identifier/index.html&quot;&gt;proof of concept&lt;/a&gt; of the attack (now fixed), which checks both a small known list of IDs but also allows you to enter an ID and it will confirm whether you are logged in to that account or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has a lot of backend endpoints which are used for various AJAX requests across the site. They are almost all are protected by &lt;code&gt;access-control-allow-origin&lt;/code&gt; headers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api.html#output&quot;&gt;magic prefixes&lt;/a&gt; on JSON responses that prevent JSON hijacking and other nasty attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched across the site looking for any endpoints that didn’t have these protections and which did pass my user id in the URL, looking for any way I may be able to parse a response from Facebook to confirm whether the UID in the URL was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also looked for any images that include the user ID in the URL and behave differently when the UID matches the logged in user (so I could do something similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/detect-visitor-social-networks/&quot;&gt;this method&lt;/a&gt;, but for specific IDs); the closest I got was an image that did behave differently but the URL also included Facebook’s well known &lt;code&gt;fb_dtsg&lt;/code&gt; parameter that is unique for users (and changes regularly) which prevented it being abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition I checked for any 301/302s in these URLs which might represent an opportunity to redirect to an image in a fashion would allow the same trick as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After carefully checking dozens of these endpoints I eventually found one that had a slight inconsistency in how it behaved which was a small gap but represented a weakness; it did have an &lt;code&gt;access-control-allow-origin&lt;/code&gt; header, but it only included a magic prefix when the user ID (in the &lt;code&gt;__user&lt;/code&gt; URL parameter) didn’t match, not when it did match. When the user ID provided in the URL did match the response was pure JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-767&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_1.png 600w, http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_1-300x90.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-768&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_2.png 599w, http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb_response_2-300x75.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because of the pesky &lt;code&gt;access-control-allow-origin&lt;/code&gt; header, I couldn’t call this via an XHR request as the browser would block it. At this point I thought it may be another dead end, but I eventually realised what I could do is use it as the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; for a normal &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; block; this would of course fail but importantly it fails in a different way in both the cases (due also to the &lt;code&gt;content-type&lt;/code&gt; header), and in such a fashion that this can be detected via &lt;code&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onerror&lt;/code&gt; event handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the URL for the endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ajax/pagelet/generic.php/TimelineEntStoryActivityLogPagelet?dpr=2&amp;amp;ajaxpipe=1&amp;amp;ajaxpipe_token=AXjeDM6DZ_aiAeG-&amp;amp;no_script_path=1&amp;amp;data=%7B%22year%22%3A2017%2C%22month%22%3A9%2C%22log_filter%22%3A%22hidden%22%2C%22profile_id%22%3A1159016196%7D&amp;amp;__user=XXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;amp;__a=1&amp;amp;__dyn=7AgNe-4amaxx2u7aJGeFxqeCwKyWzEy4aheC267UqwWhE98nwgU6C4UKK9wPGi2uUG4XzEeUK3uczobrzoeonVUkz8nxm1typ8S2m4pU5LxqrUGcwBx-1-wODBwzg7Gu4pHxx0MxK1Iz8d8vy8yeyES3m6ogUKexeEgy9EhxO2qfyZ1zx69wyQF8uhm3Ch4yEiyocUiVk48a8ky89kdGFUS&amp;amp;__req=fetchstream_8&amp;amp;__be=1&amp;amp;__pc=PHASED%3ADEFAULT&amp;amp;__rev=3832430&amp;amp;__spin_r=3832430&amp;amp;__spin_b=trunk&amp;amp;__spin_t=1524222703&amp;amp;__adt=8&amp;amp;ajaxpipe_fetch_stream=1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was then able to craft a simple Javascript script that would take a list of user IDs and generate many script tags with callbacks to determine success or failure. Because the endpoint is HTTP2 it also means you can have many of these requests in flight at once, which makes checking against large lists of IDs very quick. I did a small test here and was able to test 400-500 user IDs per second; if this was done in the background on a normal page that a user was on for a minute it would be possible to check thousands of IDs. There didn’t seem to be any sort of rate limiting on this endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/security/fb_identifier/index.html&quot;&gt;small demo&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates the attack. It checks a small list of known user IDs automatically when you arrive on the page, and also allows you to enter an ID on the page and will confirm whether you are logged in to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Facebook_Account_Leak-300x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-771&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Facebook_Account_Leak-300x160.png 300w, http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Facebook_Account_Leak-768x410.png 768w, http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Facebook_Account_Leak-700x374.png 700w, http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Facebook_Account_Leak.png 850w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is limited in that you need to be checking against a known list of users, rather than just being able to determine the user’s identity automatically. However, anyone affected by the Cambridge Analytica data situation whose data is already known, they would now be able to be identified and tracked across websites even without using any Facebook APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the most sinister exploiters (e.g. a repressive regime) of such a bug would likely have a list of people they cared about identifying (which they could also narrow down based on your location and other factors). A final example might be anyone on a corporate IP address or network, where the list of users is probably fair easy to harvest and is fairly finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the scope is fairly narrow, the impact on many may be small, but for some that impact could be high. This would certainly be a violation of privacy for any Facebook user who did get identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disclosure Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;20th April 2018 – I filed the initial bug report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20th April 2018 – Facebook replied letting me know this was being handed to the correct team to investigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st May 2018 – I requested an update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd May 2018 – FB replied – still investigating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23rd May 2018 – I requested an update, noticing it was fixed in Chrome but not Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23rd May 2018 – FB replied – they were investigating solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20th June 2018 – FB awarded a $1000 bounty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st October 2018 – I requested permission to publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st October 2018 – FB replied they were still working on the fix, and they’d update me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19th February 2019 – I followed up and FB seemed happy for me to publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(It is unclear when the final fix rolled – it looks like 6-9 months after I reported it.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>USB4 Specification Announced: Adopting Thunderbolt 3 Protocol for 40 Gbps USB</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/14048/usb4-specification-40-gbps-type-c-tb3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/14048/usb4-specification-40-gbps-type-c-tb3</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The USB Promoter Group has announced the upcoming release of the USB4 specification. The new standard is based on Intel’s Thunderbolt protocol and supports a range of features, including data transfer rates of up to 40 Gbps, display interfaces, and power delivery. The detailed USB4 specification will be published in the middle of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB4 specification will be based on the Thunderbolt protocol that Intel has contributed to the USB Promoter Group. The new interface will use USB Type-C connectors and will maintain backwards compatibility with USB 2.0, USB 3.2, and Thunderbolt 3 interfaces.  The maximum data transfer rate supported by the new USB4 interface is 40 Gbps over 40 Gbps-certified cables. Also, USB4 will support various display protocols, and power delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB4 standard will be officially ratified in the middle of 2019. At present over 50 companies are actively participating in the final stages of development of the draft USB4 specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14048/Intel-Thunderbolt3-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14048/Intel-Thunderbolt3-3_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14048/Intel-Thunderbolt3-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14048/Intel-Thunderbolt3-2_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know about the USB4 specification at this point, the new standard will use the Thunderbolt protocol, but it will not be exactly Thunderbolt 3 as its functionality will likely be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of the Thunderbolt 3 protocol to the USB Promoter Group essentially brings TB3 to mainstream PC platforms and enables various companies to integrate its support into their products. Meanwhile, Intel’s Ice Lake processors will be the first CPUs to support Thunderbolt 3 natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification is a significant milestone for making today’s simplest and most versatile port available to everyone,” said Jason Ziller, General Manager, Client Connectivity Division at Intel. “By collaborating with the USB Promoter Group, we’re opening the doors for innovation across a wide range of devices and increasing compatibility to deliver better experiences to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox Experiments I Would Have Liked to Try</title>
<link>http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been part of the Firefox Test Pilot team for several years. I had a long list of things I wanted to build. Some I didn’t personally want to build, but I thought they were interesting ideas. I didn’t get very far through this list at all, and now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot/adios-amigo-51bec2a00072&quot;&gt;Test Pilot is being retired&lt;/a&gt; I am unlikely to get to them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this I feel I have to move this work out of my head, and publishing a list of ideas seems like an okay way to do that. Many of these ideas were inspired by something I saw in the wild, sometimes a complete product (envy on my part!), or the seed of an idea embedded in some other product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are a spread: some are little features that seem potentially useful. Others are features seen elsewhere that show promise from user research, but we could only ship them with confidence if we did our own analysis. Some of these are just ideas for how to explore an area more deeply, without a clear product in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Pilot’s purpose was to find things worth shipping in the browser, which means some of these experiments aren’t novel, but there is an underlying question: would people actually use it? We can look at competitors to get ideas, but we have to ship something ourselves if we want to analyze the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Sticky Reader Mode&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/sticky-readable-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages&quot;&gt;Reader Mode&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox a preference to make it per-domain sticky. E.g. if I use Reader Mode on nytimes.com and then if I visit an article on nytimes.com in the future it’ll automatically convert to reader mode. (The nytimes.com homepage would not be a candidate for that mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an experiment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/sticky-reader-mode&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sticky-reader-mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it works really nicely. It changes the browsing experience significantly, and most importantly it doesn’t require frequent proactive engagement to change behavior. Lots of these proposed ideas are tools that require high engagement by the user, and if you don’t invoke the tool then they do nothing. In practice no one (myself included) remembers to invoke these tools. Once you click the preference on a site Sticky Reader Mode then you are opted in to this new experience with no further action required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/sticky-reader-mode/issues/5&quot;&gt;bunch of similar add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Sticky Reader Mode works a bit better than most because of its interface, and it will push you directly into Reader Mode without rendering the normal page. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; it does this by using APIs that are not public to normal WebExtensions. As a result it can’t be shipped outside Test Pilot, and can’t go in addons.mozilla.org. So… just trust me, it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve come upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/blog/speed-reader/&quot;&gt;Brave Speed Reader&lt;/a&gt; which is similar, but without per-site opt-in, and using machine learning to identify articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of a Cloud Browser&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/cloud-browser-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a browser/user-agent in the cloud and use a mobile view as a kind of semantic or parsed view on that user agent (the phone would just control the browser that is hosted on the cloud). At its simplest we just take the page, simplify it in a few ways, and send it on - similar to what Opera Mini does. The approach lends itself to a variety of task-oriented representations of remote content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote this down I had just stared at my phone while it took 30 seconds to show me a 404 page. The browser probably knew after a couple seconds that it was a 404 but it acted as a rendering engine and not a user agent, so the browser insisted on faithfully rendering the useless not found page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously running a full browser instance in the cloud is resource hungry and finicky but I think we could ignore those issues while testing. Those are hard but solved operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior art: Opera Mini does some of this. Puffin is specifically cloud rendering for mobile. Light Point does the same for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later encountered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brow.sh&quot;&gt;brow.sh&lt;/a&gt; which is another interesting take on this (specifically with &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.brow.sh&quot;&gt;html.brow.sh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very big task, but I still believe there’s tremendous potential in it. Most of my concepts are not mobile-based, in part because I don’t like mobile, I don’t like myself when using a mobile device, and it’s not something I want to put my energy into. But I still like this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Modal Page Actions&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/modal-page-actions-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was tangentially inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.vivaldi.com/article/image-properties/&quot;&gt;Vivaldi’s Image Properties&lt;/a&gt;, not because of the interface, but thinking about how to fit high-information inspection tools into the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea: instead of context menus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Page_actions&quot;&gt;page actions&lt;/a&gt;, or other interaction points that are part of the “chrome”, implement one overlay interface: the do-something-with-this-page interface. Might also be do-something-with-this-element (e.g. replacing the 7 image-related context menu items: View Image, Copy Image, Copy Image Location, Save Image As, Email Image, Set As Desktop Background, and View Image Info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface would be an overlay onto the page, similar to what happens when you start Screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshots interface&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/screenshot-interface-example-small.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that is now in the Page Action menu (the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar), or in the context menu, would be available here. Some items might have a richer interface, e.g., Send Tab To Device would show the devices directly instead of using a submenu. Bookmarking would include some inline &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for managing the resulting bookmark, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some pushback because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/&quot;&gt;line of death&lt;/a&gt; – that is, the idea all trusted content must clearly originate from the browser chrome, and not the content area. I do not believe in the Line of Death, it’s something users &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use to form trust, but I don’t believe they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use it (further user research required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general pattern is inspired by mobile interfaces which are typically much more modal than desktop interfaces. Modal interfaces have gotten a bad rap, I think somewhat undeserved: modal interfaces are also interfaces that guide you through processes, or ask you to explicitly dismiss the interface. It’s not unreasonable to expect someone to finish what they start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Find + 1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/find-plus-1-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have find-in-page but what about find-in-anything-linked-from-this-page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hit Cmd-Shift-F and you get an interface to do that. All the linked pages will be loaded in the background and as you search we show snippets of matching pages. Clicking on a snippet opens or focuses the tab and goes to where the search term was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/find-plus-one&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;find-plus-one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and encountered some challenges: hidden tabs aren’t good workers, loading pages in the background takes a lot of grinding in Firefox, and most links on pages are stupid (e.g., I don’t want to search your Careers page). An important building block would be a way to identify the important (non-navigational) parts of a page. Maybe lighter-weight ways to load pages (in other projects I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; injection). The Copy Keeper concept did come about while I experimented with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler implementation of this might simply do a text search of all your open tabs, which would be technically simpler and mostly an exercise in making a good representation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Your Front Page&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/your-front-page-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a front page of news from the sites you already visit. Like an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader, but prepopulated with your history. This creates an immediate well-populated experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was to use ad hoc parsers for popular news sites, and at run an experiment with just a long whitelist of news providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the feedback: why not just use &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;? Good question: I thought &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; was kind of passé, but I hadn’t looked for myself. I went on to do some analysis of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, and found it available for almost all news sites. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/RSS/Getting_Started/Syndicating#Adding_the_.3Clink.3E&quot;&gt;autodetection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=alternate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as widely available, and it requires manual searching to find many feeds. Still &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is a good way to get an up-to-date list of articles and their titles. Article content isn’t well represented and other article metadata is inaccurate or malformed (e.g., there are no useful tags). So using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; would be very reasonable discovery mechanism, but an “&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader” doesn’t seem like a good direction on the current web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bringing back old functionality from Page Shot, a project of mine which morphed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenshots.firefox.com&quot;&gt;Firefox Screenshots&lt;/a&gt;: save full &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; copies of pages. What used to be fairly novel is now well represented by several projects (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.webmemex.org/&quot;&gt;WebMemex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbrain.io/&quot;&gt;World Brain Memex&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have never been able to really make this kind of tool part of &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; day-to-day behavior, and I’ve become skeptical it can work for a general populace. But maybe there’s a way to package up this functionality that is more accessible, or happens more implicitly. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/pagearchive&quot;&gt;forked a version of Page Shot as pagearchive&lt;/a&gt; a while ago, with this in mind, but I haven’t (and likely won’t) come back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really a product idea, but instead an approach to developing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can imagine many tools that directly interact or learn from the content of your browsing. There is both a privacy issue here and a privacy opportunity: looking at this data is creepy, but if the tools live in your user agent (that belongs to you and hosts your information locally) then it’s not so creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s really hard to make experiments on this because you need a bunch of data. If you build a tool that starts watching your browsing then it will only slowly build up interesting information. The actual information that is already saved in browser history is interesting, but in my experience it is too limited and of poor quality. For instance, it is quite hard to build up a navigational path from the history when you use multiple tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better iterative development approach would be one where you have a static set of all the information you might want, and you can apply tools to that information. If you find something good then later you can add new data collection to the browser, secure in the knowledge that it’s going to find interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of effort on this, and produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive&quot;&gt;`personal-history-archive&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something I still want to come back to. It’s a bit of a mess, because at various times it was retrofitted to collect historical information, or collect it on an ongoing basis, or collected it when driven by a script. I also tried to build tools in parallel for doing analysis on the resulting database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a byproduct of experimentation with machine learning. I wanted to apply things I was learning to browser data, but the data I wanted wasn’t there. I spent all my time collecting and cleaning data, and ended up spending only a small amount of time analyzing the data. I suspect I’m not the only one who has done this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Navigational Breadcrumbs&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/navigational-breadcrumbs-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I click on a link I lose the reminder of why I clicked on it. What on the previous page led me to click on this? Was I promised something? Are there sibling links that I might want to continue to directly instead of going back and selecting another link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool would give you additional information about the page you are on, how you got there, and given where you came from, where you might go next. Would this be a sidebar? Overlay content? In a popup? I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: using this, if I click on a link from Reddit I will be able to see the title of the Reddit post (which usually doesn’t match the document title), and a link to comments on the page. If I follow a link from Twitter, I’ll be able to see the Tweet I came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be interesting paired with link preview (like a tentative forward). Maybe the mobile browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkbubble.com/&quot;&gt;Linkbubbles&lt;/a&gt; (now integrated into Brave) has some ideas to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically this will use some of the techniques from Personal History Archive, which tracks link sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on the train of thought I wrote down &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17702206&quot;&gt;in an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; comment&lt;/a&gt; – itself a response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reinterpretcast.com/open-hypermedia&quot;&gt;Freeing the Web from the Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try this still, and have started a repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/crossnav&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;crossnav&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but haven’t put anything there yet. I think even some naive approaches could work, just trying to detect the &lt;em&gt;category&lt;/em&gt; of link and the &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; links (e.g., on Reddit the category is other submissions, and the related links are things like comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Copy Keeper&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/copy-keeper-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notebook/logbook that is filled in every time you copy from a web page. When you copy it records (locally):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text of selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; of selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of the block element around the selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text around selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and nearest anchor/id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overloads “copy” to mean “remember”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clips would be searchable, and could be moved back to the clipboard in different forms (text, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, image, bibliographical reference, source &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;). Maybe clips would be browsable in a sidebar (maybe the sidebar has to be open for copies to be collected), or clips could be browsed in a normal tab (Library-style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a prototype in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/copy-keeper&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;copy-keeper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it was interesting and usable, though whether it would actually get any use in practice I don’t know. It’s one of those tools that seems handy but requires effort, and as a result doesn’t get used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Change Scout&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/change-scout-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Wherein I both steal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/mozilla-scout-voice-controlled-browser-2018-6&quot;&gt;name from another team&lt;/a&gt;, and turn it into a category…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change Scout will monitor a page for you, and notify you when it changes. Did someone edit the document? Was there activity on an issue? Did an article get updated? Put Change Scout to track it and it will tell you what changes and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would monitor the page inside the browser, so it would have access to personalized and authenticated content. A key task would be finding ways to present changes in an interesting and compact way. In another experiment I tried some very simple change detection tools, and mostly end up frustrated (small changes look very large to naive algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tab Switcher mockup&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/tab-switcher-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the exact &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/side-view&quot;&gt;Side View&lt;/a&gt; popup, but make it a tab switcher. “Recent Tabs” are the most recently focused tabs (weighted somewhat by how long you were on the tab), and then there’s the complete scrollable list. Clicking on an item simply focuses that tab. You can close tabs without focusing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a prototype in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/tab-switchr&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tab-switchr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it I also added some controls to close tabs, which was very useful for my periodic tab cleanups. Given that it was a proactive tool, I surprised myself by using it frequently. There’s work in Firefox to improve this, unrelated to anything I’ve done. It reminds me a bit of various &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/&quot;&gt;Tree-Style Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, which I both like because they make it easier to see my tabs, and dislike because I ultimately am settled on normal top-tabs. The popup interface is less radical but still provides many of the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably clean this up a little and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create your own &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you are on a page with some audio source, you can add the audio to your personal feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When on an article, you can generate an audio version that will be added to the feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed with a random token to make it private (I don’t think podcast apps handle authentication well, but this requires research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe you can just send/text the link to add it to your preferred podcast app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If apps don’t accept &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; links very well, maybe something more complicated would be required. An app that just installs an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed? We want to avoid the feed accidentally ending up in podcast directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of low-rated bookmark managers in addons.mozilla.org and the Chrome Extension store. Let’s make our own low-rated bookmark manager!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, this would anticipate updates to the Library and built-in bookmark manager, which are deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some resources/ideas: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17072803&quot;&gt;Comment with a few gripes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-manager/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google’s bookmark manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmarks-manager-and-viewer/?src=search&quot;&gt;Bookmark section on addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmarks-organizer/?src=search&quot;&gt;Bookmark organizers on addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; * &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks&quot;&gt;Relevant WebExtension APIs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of the Extended Library&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/extended-library-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Library” in Firefox is the combination history and bookmark browser you get if you use “Show all bookmarks” or “Show all history”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this idea we present the user with a record of their &lt;strong&gt;assets&lt;/strong&gt;, wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like a history view (and would be built from history), but would use heuristics to pick out certain kinds of things: docs you’ve edited, screenshots you’ve taken, tickets you’ve opened, etc. We’d be trying hard to find long-lived documents in your history, instead of transitional navigation, articles, things you’ve gotten to from public indexes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically determining what should be tagged as a “library item” would be the hard part. But I think having an organic view of these items, regardless of underlying service, would be quite valuable. The browser has access to all your services, and it’s easy to forget what service hosts the thing you are thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;mockup of Text Mobile Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/media/mockups/text-mobile-screenshot-start.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool will render the tab in a mobile factor (using the devtools &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode&quot;&gt;responsive design mode&lt;/a&gt;), take a full-page screenshot, and text the image and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a given number. Probably it would only support texting to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve looked into this some, and getting the mobile view of a page is not entirely obvious and requires digging around deep in the browser. Devtools does some complicated stuff to display the mobile view. The rest is basic &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; flows and operational support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emails the Reader Mode version of a site to yourself. In our research, people love to store things in Email, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it lacks the simplicity of this concept, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/email-tabs&quot;&gt;Email Tabs&lt;/a&gt; contains this basic functionality. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emailthis.me/&quot;&gt;Email This&lt;/a&gt; does almost exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extension that finds and syncs your history between browsers (particularly between Chrome and Firefox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history&quot;&gt;history WebExtension APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe we could create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Sync&quot;&gt;Firefox Sync&lt;/a&gt; client in Chrome. Maybe it could be a general way to move things between browsers. Actual synchronization is hard, but creating read-only views into the data in another browser profile is much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there’s lots of work to synchronize this data between Firefox properties, and knowing the work involved this isn’t easy and often involves close work with the underlying platform. Without full access to the platform (like on Chrome) we’ll have to find ways to simplify the problem in order to make it feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone (with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/&quot;&gt;FxA account&lt;/a&gt;) gets there own homepage on the web. It’s like Geocities! Or maybe closer to github.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more seriously, it would be programmatically accessible simple static hosting. Not just for you to write your own homepage, but an open way for applications to publish user content, without those applications themselves turning into hosting platforms. We’d absorb all the annoyances of hosting content (abuse, copyright, quotas, ops, financing) and let open source developers focus on enabling interesting content generation experiences for users on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/we-need-open-hosting-platforms.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a general argument&lt;/a&gt; why I think this would be a useful thing for us to do. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;And another from Les Orchard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a proposal for user research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron apps are being shipped for many services, including services that don’t require any special system integration. E.g., Slack doesn’t require anything that a web browser can’t do. Spotify maybe catches some play/pause keys, but is very close to being a web site. Yet there is perceived value in having an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user research would focus on cases where the Electron app doesn’t have any/many special permissions. What gives the app value over the web page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal would be to understand the motivations and constraints of users, so we could consider ways to make the in-browser experience equally pleasant to the Electron app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per my previous item: why do I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irccloud.com/&quot;&gt;IRCCloud&lt;/a&gt; app? Why do people use Slack apps? Maybe it’s just because they want to be able to switch into and out of those apps quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposed product solution: add a shortcut to any specific (pinned?) tab. Might be autocreated. Using the shortcut when the app is already selected will switch you back to your previous-selected tab. Switching to the tab without the shortcut will display a gentle reminder that the shortcut exists (so you can train yourself to start using it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it a little more fancy, I thought we might also be able to do a second related “preview” shortcut. This would let you peek into the window. I’m not sure what “peeking” means. Maybe we just show a popup with a screenshot of that other window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this should all just overload ⌘1/2/3 (maybe shift-⌘1/etc for peeking). Note these shortcuts do not currently have memory – you can switch &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the first tab with ⌘1, but you can’t switch back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one suggested solution to &lt;em&gt;Whatever Electron does for people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started some work in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianb/quick-switch-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;quick-switch-extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but keyboard shortcuts were a bit wonky, and I couldn’t figure out useful additional functionality that would make it fun. Firefox (Nightly?) now has Ctrl-Tab functionality that takes you to recent tabs, mitigating this problem (though it is not nearly as predictable as what I propose here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just Save saves a page. It’s like a bookmark. Or a remembering. Or an archive. Or all of those all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Save is a one-click operation, though a popup does show up (similar in function to Pocket) that would allow some additional annotation of your saved page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We save: 1. Link 2. Title 3. Standard metadata 4. Screenshot 5. Frozen version of page 6. Scroll position 7. The tab history 8. Remember the other open tabs, so if some of them are saved we offer later relations between them 9. Time the page was saved 10. Query terms that led to the page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like bookmarks, but purely focused on saving, while bookmarks do double-duty as a navigational tool. The tool encourages after-the-fact discovery and organization, not at-the-time-of-save choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course there’s a way to find and manage your saved pages. This idea needs more exploration of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you would return to a page or piece of information, and thus what we’d want to expose and surface from your history. We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2015/02/save-share-revisit/&quot;&gt;done research&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s really just a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have several &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/searchplugins&quot;&gt;open search providers&lt;/a&gt;. How many exist out there? How many could we find in history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch&quot;&gt;Open Search is an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where a user could do personalized search across many properties, though I’m not sure if any sufficient number of sites has enabled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;, but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/slash-commands&quot;&gt;slash commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I other words it’s a document, but if you complete a line that begins with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; then it will try to execute that command, appending or overwriting from that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance &lt;code&gt;/timestamp&lt;/code&gt; just replaces itself with a timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;code&gt;/page&lt;/code&gt; inserts the currently active tab. &lt;code&gt;/search foo&lt;/code&gt; puts search results into the document, but as editable (and followable) links. &lt;code&gt;/page save&lt;/code&gt; freezes the page as one big data link, and inserts that link into the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little like Slack, but in document form, and with the browser as the context instead of a messaging platform. It’s a little like a notebook programming interface, but less structured and more document-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to edit the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; of commands is particularly interesting to me, and represents the kind of ad hoc information organizing that we all do regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented some with this in Notes, and got it working a little bit, but working with CKEditor (that Notes is built on) was just awful and I couldn’t get anything to work well. Notes also has a very limited set of supported content (no images or links), which was problematic. Maybe it’s worth doing it from scratch (with &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosemirror.net/&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I tried to mock this up, I realized that the underlying model is much too unclear in my mind. What’s this for? &lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; is it for? What would a list of commands look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I realized while attempting a mockup is that there should be a rich but normalized way to represent pages and URLs and so forth. Often you’ll be referring to URLs of pages that are already open. You may want to open sets of pages, or see immediately which URLs are already open in a tab. A frozen version of a page should be clearly linked to the source of that page, which of course could be an open tab. There’s a lot of pieces to fit together here, both common nouns and verbs, all of which interact with the browser session itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation and scripting for your browser: make demonstrations for your browser, give it a name, and you have a repeatable script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripts will happen in the browser itself, not via any backend or scraping tool. In case of failed expectations or changed sites, the script will halt and tell the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts could be as simple as “open a new tab pointing to this page every weekday at 9am”, or could involve clipping information, or just doing a navigational pattern before presenting the page to a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge amount of previous work in this area. I think the challenge here is to create something that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; look like a programming language displayed in a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidekick is a sidebar interface to anything, or everything, contextually. Some things it might display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show you the state of your clipboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you how you got to the current tab (similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#navigational-breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;Navigational Breadcrumbs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you other items from the search query that kicked off the current tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give quick navigation to nearby pages, given the referring page (e.g., the next link, or next set of links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you buttons to activate other tabs you are likely to switch to from the current tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show shopping recommendations or other content-aware widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let you save little tidbits (text, links, etc), like an extended clipboard or notepad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show notifications you’ve recently received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peek into other tabs, or load them inline somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/side-view/&quot;&gt;Side View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists and todos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy a bunch of links into the sidebar, then treat them like a todo/queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly it could be treated like an extensible widget holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective: this is like a continuous contextual feature recommender. I.e., it would try to answer the question: what’s the feature you could use right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally in order to commit something to long-term memory you must revisit information later, ideally long enough that it’s a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything we see in a browser worth committing to long-term memory? Sometimes it feels like nothing is worth remembering, but that’s a kind of nihilism based on the shitty aspects of typical web browsing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface would require some positive assertion: I want to know this. Probably you’d want to highlight the thing you’d “know”. Then, later, we’d want to come up with some challenge. We don’t need a “real” test that is verified by the browser, instead we simply need to ask some related question, then the user can say if they got it right or not (or remembered it or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader mode is a bit spartan. Maybe it could be a bit nicer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick up some styles or backgrounds from the hosting site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display images or other media differently or more prominently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add back some markup or layout that Readability erases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to some other kinds of sites that aren’t articles (e.g., a video site)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multicolumn version like &lt;a href=&quot;https://anoved.github.io/mcreadability/&quot;&gt;McReadability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fullhn.com/&quot;&gt;Full Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18132281&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;): take a bunch of links (typically articles) and concatenate their content into one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicitly this requires Reader Mode parsing of the pages, though that is relatively cheap for “normal” articles. Acquiring a list of pages is somewhat less clear. Getting a list of pages is a kind of news/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; question. Taking a page &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; Hacker News and figuring out what the “real” links are is another approach that may be interesting. Lists of related links are everywhere, yet hard to formally define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work very nicely with complementary text summarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open question: is this actually an interesting or useful way to consume information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an underlying concept here worth explaining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature develop receives a lot of skepticism. And it’s reasonable: there’s a lot of conceit in a feature, especially embedded in a large product. Are people going to use a product or not because of some little feature? Or maybe the larger challenge: can some feature actually change behavior? Every person has their own thing going on, people aren’t interested in our theories, and really not that many people are interested in browsers. Familiar functionality – the back button, bookmarks, the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar, etc. – are what they expect, what they came for, and what they will gravitate to. Everything I’ve written so far in this list are things &lt;em&gt;people won’t actually use&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A browser is particularly problematic because it’s so universal. It’s for sites and apps and articles. It’s for the young and the elderly, the experienced and not. It’s used for serious things, it’s used for concentration, and it’s used for dumb things and to avoid concentrating. How can you build a feature for everyone, targeting anything they might do? And if you build something, how can a person trust a new feature is really for &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, not some other person? People are right to be skeptical of the new!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also know that most people regularly use more than one browser. Some people use Chrome for personal stuff, and Firefox for work. Some people do the exact opposite. Some people do their banking and finance in a specific browser. Some use a specific browser just for watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which&lt;/em&gt; browser a person uses for which task is seemingly random. Maybe they were told to use a specific browser for one task, and then the other browser became the fallback. Maybe they once heard somewhere once that one browser was more secure. Maybe flash seemed broken on one browser when they were watching a video, and now a pattern has been set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has long seemed like an opportunity to me. Market a browser that actually claims to be the right browser for some of these purposes! Firefox has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/&quot;&gt;Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been reasonably successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offers an opportunity for both Mozilla and Firefox users to agree on &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. What is Firefox for? Everything! Is this feature meant for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? Unlikely! In a purpose-built browser both sides can agree what it’s trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea often gets poo-pooed for how much work it is, but I think it’s simpler than it seems. Here’s what a “new browser” means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something you can find and download from its own page or site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s Firefox, but uses its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;, keeping history/etc separate from other browser instances (including Firefox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has its own name and icon, and probably a theme to make it obvious what browser you are in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with some browser extensions and prefs changed, making it more appropriate for the proposed use case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is heavy on marketing and build tools, and light on actual browser engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have gotten frequent feedback that &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot;&gt;Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; should solve all these use cases, but that gets everything backwards. People already understand multiple browsers, and having completely new entry points to bring people to Firefox is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I think the time for this has passed, maybe in the market generally or maybe just for Mozilla. It would have been a very different approach to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us in the Test Pilot team had some good brainstorming around actual concepts too, which is where I actually get excited about the ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-study&quot; id=&quot;firefox-study&quot;&gt;Firefox Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students, studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrate note-taking tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create project and class-based organizational tools, helping to organize tabs, bookmarks, and notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools to document and organize deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citation generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do with online lectures and video, but it feels like there’s some meaningful improvements to be done in that space. Video-position-aware notetaking tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the intentionality of opening a browser to study is a good thing. iPads are somewhat popular in education, and I suspect part of that is having a device that isn’t built around multitasking, and using an iPad means stepping away from regular computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-media&quot; id=&quot;firefox-media&quot;&gt;Firefox Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To watch videos. This requires very few features, but benefits from just being a separate profile, history, and icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a small number of features that might be useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross-service search (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canistream.it/&quot;&gt;Can I Stream.it&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justwatch.com/&quot;&gt;JustWatch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search defaults to video search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-service queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick service-based navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize it’s a lot like Roku in an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-for-finance&quot; id=&quot;firefox-for-finance&quot;&gt;Firefox for Finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really just about security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny story: people say they value security very highly. But if Mozilla wants to make changes in Firefox that increase security but break some sites – particularly insecure sites – people will then stop using Firefox. They value security highly, but still just below &lt;em&gt;anything at all breaking&lt;/em&gt;. This is very frustrating for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I kind of get it. I’m dorking around on the web and I click through to some dumb site, and I get a big ol’ warning or a blank page or some other weirdness. I didn’t even care about the page or its security, and here my browser is trying to make me care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s true some of the time, but not others. If you are using Firefox for Finance, or Firefox Super Secure, or whatever we might call it, then you really do care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a second kind of security implied here as well: security from snooping eyes and on shared computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-master-password-protect-stored-logins&quot;&gt;Firefox Master Password&lt;/a&gt; is a useful feature here. Generally there’s an opportunity for secure data at rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a vehicle for education in computer security, with an audience that we know is interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-low-bandwidth&quot; id=&quot;firefox-low-bandwidth&quot;&gt;Firefox Low Bandwidth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we work with proxy services. Or just do lots of content blocking. In this browser we let content break (and give a control to load the full content), so long as you start out compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cache content that isn’t really supposed to be cached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t load some kinds of content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block fonts and other seemingly-unimportant content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring tools to see where bandwidth usage is going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-for-kids&quot; id=&quot;firefox-for-kids&quot;&gt;Firefox for Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly making things for kids is hard, because you are obliged to do all sorts of things if you claim to target children, but you don’t have to do anything if kids just happen to use your tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an industry of tools in this area that I don’t fully understand, and I’d want to research before thinking about a feature list. But it seems like it comes down to three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blocking problematic content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging positive content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring tools for parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s something very uninspiring about that list, it feels like it’s long on negativity and short on positive engagement. Coming up with an answer to that is not a simple task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#firefox-calm&quot; id=&quot;firefox-calm&quot;&gt;Firefox Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a bunch of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would a calm Firefox experience look like? Or maybe it would be better to think about a calm presentation of the web. At some point I wrote out some short pitches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read without distraction: Read articles like they are articles, not interactive (and manipulative) experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay focused on one thing at a time: Instead of a giant list of tabs and alerts telling you what we aren’t doing, automatically focus on the one thing you are doing right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your notifications: Instead of letting any site poke at you for any reason, notifications are kept to a minimum and batched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused writing: When you need to focus on what you are saying, not what people are saying to you, enter focused writing mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get updates without falling down a news hole: Avoid clickbait, don’t reload pages, just see updates from the sites you trust (relates to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html#your-front-page&quot;&gt;Your Front Page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro: let yourself get distracted… but only a little bit. The Pomodoro technique helps you switch between periods of focused work and letting yourself relax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t even ask: Do you want notifications from the news site you visited once? Do you want videos to autoplay? Of course not, and we’ll stop even asking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggestion-free browsing: Every page you look at isn’t an invitation to tell you what you should look at next. Remove suggested content, and do what &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; want to do next. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/&quot;&gt;YouTube example&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just the conclusion of this list, the conclusion of my work in this area…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some challenges in the design process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asking someone to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something new is hard, and unlikely to happen. My previous post (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/overengaged-knowledge-worker.html&quot;&gt;The Over-engaged Knowledge Worker&lt;/a&gt;) relates to this tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… and yet a “problem” isn’t enough to get someone to do something either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is consciously &lt;em&gt;and specifically&lt;/em&gt; doing some task, then there’s an opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating wholistic solutions is unwelcome, unintuitively each thing that adds to the size of a solution &lt;em&gt;diminishes&lt;/em&gt; from the breadth of problems the solution can solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… and yet, abstract solutions without any clear suggestion of what they solve aren’t great either!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out how to package functionality is a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approaches that increase the density of information or choices are themselves somewhat burdensome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… and yet context-sensitive approaches are unpredictable and distracting compared to consistent (if dense) functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still believe there’s a wealth of material in the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of the pages people encounter. But it’s irregular and hard to understand, it takes concerted and long-term effort to do something here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of the easy stuff, the roads well traveled, are still hard for a lot of people. Maybe this can be fixed by optimizing current &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;… but I think there’s still room for novel improvements to old ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research is a really great place to start, but it’s not very prescriptive. It’s mostly problem-finding, not solution-finding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s some kinds of user research I wish I had access to, specifically really low level analysis of behavior. What’s in someone’s mind when they open a new tab, or reuse one? In what order do they scan the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;? What are mental models of a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, of pages and how they change, in what order to people compose (mentally and physically) things they want to share… it feels like it can go on forever, and there would be a ton of detail in the results, but given all the other constraints these insights feel important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s so many variables in an experiment, that it’s hard to know what failures really means. Every experiment that offers a novel experience involves several choices, and any one choice can cause the experiment to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Test Pilot comes to an end, I do find myself asking: is there room for qualitative improvements in desktop browser &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;? Desktop computing is waning. User expectations of a browser are calcified. The only time people make a choice is when something breaks, and the only way to win is to not break anything and hope you competitor &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; break things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there room for improvement? Of course there is! The millions of hours spent every day in Firefox alone… &lt;em&gt;this is actually important&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, a lot of things are at a local maximum, and we can A/B test little tweaks to get some suboptimal parts to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; local maximum. But I do not believe in any way that the browsers we know are the optimal container. The web is bigger than browsers, bigger than desktop or mobile or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt;, and a user agent can do unique things beyond any site or app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet…&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Generating C code that people want to use</title>
<link>http://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2019/01/04/behind-the-scenes.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2019/01/04/behind-the-scenes.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://project-everest.github.io/&quot;&gt;Project Everest&lt;/a&gt; is a large, collaborative research effort that aims to verify and deploy a new, secure HTTPS stack. All of our code is verified using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fstar-lang.org&quot;&gt;F*&lt;/a&gt; programming language. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FStarLang/kremlin/&quot;&gt;KreMLin&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated compiler, the verified F* code is compiled to readable C, meaning existing systems projects can readily integrate our verified code. Going to C is what allows people to use our code without having to buy into exotic, strange languages with lambdas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years into the project, we have successfully integrated code into mainstream software, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/09/13/verified-cryptography-firefox-57/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; and Windows. Along the way, we learned what it takes to deliver quality C code that can be taken seriously and integrated into an actual source tree. We made many rookie mistakes and discovered the discrepancy between what we, researchers, thought was ok, and what was expected of us by actual software developers. None of these lessons will ever make it into a paper, which makes a perfect fit for a blog post. I have shared many of these anecdotes in informal conversations or talks; apologies if you’ve heard some of this already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first big “client” of Project Everest turned out to be Firefox. This initial success was in large part due to the well-known strategy of infiltrating PhD students at large companies or non-profits (e.g. Mozilla), hoping that after setting camp as interns, they would be in a position to push for verified code from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-engineers-review-generated-code&quot;&gt;Software engineers review generated code!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sure expected that generating idiomatic C code was important, and this informed a lot of early design choices in our toolchain. We were surprised, however, by how closely Mozilla reviewed and manually inspected the generated C code. This revealed a number of issues that we never thought were actual blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many temporaries were inserted by F*, to enforce the evaluation order of arguments, something which is guaranteed by neither C of OCaml, the two main extraction backends of F*. Alas, this extra precision was not appreciated by reviewers, who very explicitly requested that variables named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uu__123456&lt;/code&gt; be eliminated whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computationally-irrelevant function arguments were erased as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; arguments, a correct but suboptimal compilation scheme that gives un-natural function signatures in C headers. Also a no-go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote the pretty-printer for our compiler, KReMLin, looking at the reference table of operator precedence in C, resulting in a minimal amount of parentheses being inserted; I happily thought I did the optimal thing, until it turned out that no one can remember the relative precedence of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; – I have myself since then forgotten, and I’ve heard that it even differs across languages…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shortcomings were fixed as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The auto-generated names were removed using a custom pass in the KReMLin compiler that performs a def-use analysis via a syntactic criterion, and is aware of the C semantics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extra unit arguments were removed, first by KReMLin, then in F* itself, which now ensures that the OCaml extraction of F* also generates prettier code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KReMLin became reasonable and added an option to generate extra parentheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A myriad of other details were fixed, such as always adding curly braces around conditional blocks, indentation, unused variable elimination, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, even if it doesn’t matter for a C compiler, the expectation was truly that the resulting C code would be as crisp, clean and readable as what a C programmer would have written. In hindsight, that’s fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-go-functional-on-a-c-compiler&quot;&gt;Don’t go functional on a C compiler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early experiments, as programmers of functional training and descent, we relied heavily on recursion: reasoning is easier with recursive calls (it’s easy to call some lemma &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the recursive call returns); it also makes implementing our functional specifications easier, something important for students who need to a progressive ramp-up with our toolchain. For all those scenarios, we relied on GCC 7’s excellent tail-call optimization, as a stop-gap measure in support of rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once one leaves the cocoon of modern compilers and toolchains, and discovers the vast range of compiler versions and architectures under Mozilla’s CI, it becomes evident that relying on any sort of tail-calls optimizations would be unreasonable: very few compilers reliably perform tail-call optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were confronted with that reality when a (temporary) piece of code blew the stack using a non-GCC compiler. It was converting between two abstractions for arrays by performing a very idiomatic, functional, byte-by-byte recursive copy. It was later rewritten with a call to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt;, and will soon disappear as we unify the two abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another gripe that we had was our heavy reliance on passing structures by value. KReMLin supports, as an extension, data types passed as values, using a tagged union compilation scheme. It is awfully convenient, since structures as values have no lifetime, and are hence manipulated as pure values within F*, incurring no extra verification cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing structures by value is allowed by the C standard, but this is costly. Most ABIs mandate that such structures, if larger than a few words, be passed by pushing their contents onto the stack. This showed up in our performance profiles; our new guideline is to essentially only use those when their size does not exceed four words on a 64-bit architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even small structures caused issues. Due to multiple layers of type abstraction, and owing to the tagged union compilation scheme of KReMLin, we ended up with series of field accesses over 10 fields long, which hit a hardcoded limit in one of our supported compilers. This was later solved by extending KReMLin with three new compilation schemes for data types, optimizing special cases (inductive has one branch; no branch has more than one argument; etc.) to reduce the depth of field accesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;forget-about-abstraction-and-modularity&quot;&gt;Forget about abstraction and modularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with F*, we (unsurprisingly) split our code into separate modules, to leverage modularity, maintainability, and parallel verification. Within modules, larger functions were split into small, individual helpers, each adorned with their respective pre- and post-conditions, for robustness and readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to C, a priority for the KReMLin compiler was to get rid of this pesky abstraction and modularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, no one wants to land in their repository an algorithm spread out across 20 different source files, no matter how beautiful and well-designed the original source code was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naïvely translating each F* module to an individual C file had a more pernicious effect: this generated a lot of calls across translation units (C files), meaning that a large chunk of the call graph was forced to abide by the rules of external linkage and the calling convention dictated by the compiler’s ABI. Specifically, this prevented the compiler from optimizing function calls by, say, passing more arguments in registers. This had a disastrous effect on performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even splitting functions into smaller helpers prevented a lot of intra-procedural analyses from kicking in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was alleviated with two mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;KReMLin got equipped with a bundling mechanism driven by a micro-DSL, which allows the programmer to specify how to recombine multiple source F* modules into a single C translation unit (file), indicating which functions are the API entry points, leaving the rest of the module marked as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static inline&lt;/code&gt;, which has a big effect on performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially done in KReMLin, now in F*, the programmer has the ability to mark functions as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noextract inline_for_extraction&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that the helper will be inlined at call-site and will not itself be extracted to a separate function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bundling mechanism works in conjunction with a reachability analysis that removes anything not reachable from the API entry points, hence ensuring that no unused helper remains in the generated C code, something that also made our consumers queasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reproducible-builds&quot;&gt;Reproducible builds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our toolchain relies on OCaml, custom compilers, and a variety of tools that turned out to be very hard to set up. We have now switched entirely to a Docker-based CI infrastructure, which makes distributing our code trivial. Mozilla adopted this and runs a Docker build command in their own CI, which errors out if someone tries to modify the generated code instead of fixing the F* source file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;audit-all-the-non-verified-code&quot;&gt;Audit all the non-verified code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post wouldn’t be complete without a few words about the bugs we found. Apart from a compiler bug, two amusing bugs occurred in hand-written code and are worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had a somewhat puzzling stack corruption. The reason turned out to be an external header improperly defining a macro. Now for the details…&lt;br/&gt;C99 provides fixed-width integer types (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;inttypes.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, along with corresponding macros for printing and scanning fixed-width integers via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;. We rely heavily on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;inttypes.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but compiling for Windows, the header didn’t seem to be available by default. We did find, however a copy of this header somewhere, and used it to write a routine to convert a hex-encoded string into the corresponding byte array, using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SCNx8&lt;/code&gt; macro for scanning a single hex-encoded byte into a temporary on the stack. Unbeknownst to us, the underlying C library had no runtime support for scanning a single byte, but this did not deter the author of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inttypes.h&lt;/code&gt; header we found from defining the macro nonetheless, scanning &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; bytes into the destination address, causing a buffer overrun. It looks like other people (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libusb_aah/+/60ed380e961ed65bf2ddeb16d43121cdbeba6d3e/msvc/inttypes.h#205&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) were careful not to define &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SCNx8&lt;/code&gt; on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We regularly audit our hand-written code using Clang’s sanitizers. This caught a few undefined behaviors. The most blatant one was for code reading 4 little-endian bytes, returning the corresponding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt;. The author of the initial implementation wrote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;return *((uint32_t *)src);&lt;/code&gt;, not realizing that in the case that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; is not aligned, this is undefined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have a fairly solid process for distributing code, gathering the artifacts of Project Everest in self-contained directories that any client can copy and integrate into their project. It took us a long way to get there, but we are now ready to scale up to multiple consumers of our code, an excellent news as we gear up towards more software releases, such as EverCrypt, which I shall cover in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Generating C code that people actually want to use</og:title>
<og:description>Project Everest is a large, collaborative research effort that aims to verify and deploy a new, secure HTTPS stack. All of our code is verified using the F* programming language. Using KreMLin, a dedicated compiler, the verified F* code is compiled to readable C, meaning existing systems projects can readily integrate our verified code. Going to C is what allows people to use our code without having to buy into exotic, strange languages with lambdas.</og:description>

<title>Google Employees Uncover Ongoing Work on Censored China Search</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2019/03/04/google-ongoing-project-dragonfly/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2019/03/04/google-ongoing-project-dragonfly/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;194&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google employees have&lt;/u&gt; carried out their own investigation into the company’s plan to launch a censored search engine for China and say they are concerned that development of the project remains ongoing, The Intercept can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Late last year, bosses moved engineers away from working on the controversial project, known as Dragonfly, and said that there were no current plans to launch it. However, a group of employees at the company was unsatisfied with the lack of information from leadership on the issue — and took matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The group has identified ongoing work on a batch of code that is associated with the China search engine, according to three Google sources. The development has stoked anger inside Google offices, where many of the company’s 88,000 workforce previously protested against plans to launch the search engine, which was designed to censor broad categories of information associated with human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;196&quot; readability=&quot;101.70285492329&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;In December, The Intercept &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/12/17/google-china-censored-search-engine-2/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that an internal dispute and political pressure on Google had stopped development of Dragonfly. Google bosses had originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/12/17/google-china-censored-search-engine-2/&quot;&gt;planned&lt;/a&gt; to launch it between January and April of this year. But they changed course after the outcry over the plan and indicated to employees who were working on the project that it was being shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google’s Caesar Sengupta, an executive with a leadership role on Dragonfly, told engineers and others who were working on the censored search engine in mid-December that they would be allocated new projects funded by different “cost centers” of the company’s budget. In a message marked “confidential – do not forward,” which has been newly obtained by The Intercept, Sengupta told the Dragonfly workers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few quarters, we have tackled different aspects of what search would look like in China. While we’ve made progress in our understanding of the market and user needs, many unknowns remain and currently we have no plans to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Back in July we said at our all hands that we did not feel we could make much progress right now. Since then, many people have effectively rolled off the project while others have been working on adjacent areas such as improving our Chinese language capabilities that also benefit users globally. Thank you for all of your hard work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;As we finalize business planning for 2019, our priority is for you to be productive and have clear objectives, so we have started to align cost centers to better reflect what people are actually working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Thanks again — and your leads will follow up with you on next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said staff who were working on the project were not told to immediately cease their efforts. Rather, they were instructed to finish up the jobs they were doing and then they would be allocated new work on other teams. Some of those who were working on Dragonfly were moved into different areas, focusing on projects related to Google’s search services in India, Indonesia, Russia, the Middle East, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just don’t know where the leadership is coming from anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;But Google executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, refused both publicly and privately to completely rule out launching the censored search engine in the future. This led a group of concerned employees — who were themselves not directly involved with Dragonfly — to closely monitor the company’s internal systems for information about the project and circulate their findings on an internal messaging list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The employees have been keeping tabs on repositories of code that are stored on Google’s computers, which they say is linked to Dragonfly. The code was created for two smartphone search apps — named Maotai and Longfei — that Google planned to roll out in China for users of Android and iOS mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The employees identified about 500 changes to the code in December, and more than 400 changes to the code between January and February of this year, which they believe indicates continued development of aspects of Dragonfly. (Since August 2017, the number of code changes has varied between about 150 to 500 each month, one source said.) The employees say there are still some 100 workers allocated to the “cost center” associated with Dragonfly, meaning that the company is maintaining a budget for potential ongoing work on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said that the code changes could possibly be attributed to employees who have continued this year to wrap up aspects of the work they were doing to develop the Chinese search platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;“I still believe the project is dead, but we’re still waiting for a declaration from Google that censorship is unacceptable and that they will not collaborate with governments in the oppression of their people,” said one source familiar with Dragonfly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The lack of clarity from management has resulted in Google losing skilled engineers and developers. In recent months, several Google employees have resigned in part due to Dragonfly and leadership’s handling of the project. The Intercept knows of six staff at the company, including two in senior positions, who have quit since December, and three others who are planning to follow them out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Colin McMillen, who worked as a software engineer at Google for nine years, quit the company in early February. He told The Intercept that he had been concerned about Dragonfly and other “ethically dubious” decisions, such as Google’s multimillion-dollar severance packages for executives accused of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-left&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think they are going to try it again in a year or two.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Prior to leaving the company, McMillen said he and his colleagues had “strong indications that something is still happening” with Google search in China. But they were left confused about the status of the China plan because upper management would not discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;“I just don’t know where the leadership is coming from anymore,” he said. “They have really closed down communication and become significantly less transparent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;In 2006, Google launched a censored search engine in China, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot;&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; operating the service in the country in 2010, taking a clear anti-censorship position. At the time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/google-co-founder-on-pulling-out-of-china-it-was-a-real-step-backward-a-686269.html&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to show that the company was “opposing censorship and speaking out for the freedom of political dissent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Pichai, Google’s CEO since 2015, has taken a different position. He has a strong desire to launch search again in China — viewing the censorship as a worthwhile trade-off to gain access to the country’s more than 800 million internet users — and he may now be waiting for the controversy around Dragonfly to die down before quietly resurrecting the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;“Right now it feels unlaunchable, but I don’t think they are canceling outright,” McMillen said. “I think they are putting it on the back burner and are going to try it again in a year or two with a different code name or approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Anna Bacciarelli, a technology researcher at Amnesty International, called on Google “to publicly confirm that it has dropped Dragonfly for good, not just ‘for now.’” Bacciarelli told The Intercept that Amnesty’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo had visited Google’s Mountain View headquarters in California last week to reiterate concerns over Dragonfly and “the apparent disregard for transparency and accountability around the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;If Google is still developing the censored search engine, Bacciarelli said, “it’s not only failing on its human rights responsibilities but ignoring the hundreds of Google employees, more than 70 human rights organizations, and hundreds of thousands of campaign supporters around the world who have all called on the company to respect human rights and drop Dragonfly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google Moves to Address Wage Equity, and Finds It’s Underpaying Many Men</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/google-gender-pay-gap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/google-gender-pay-gap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — When Google conducted a study recently to determine whether the company was underpaying women and members of minority groups, it found, to the surprise of just about everyone, that men were paid less money than women for doing similar work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The study, which disproportionately led to pay raises for thousands of men, is done every year, but the latest findings arrived as Google and other companies in Silicon Valley face increasing pressure to deal with gender issues in the workplace, from sexual harassment to wage discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Gender inequality is a radioactive topic at Google. The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/8/15229688/department-of-labor-google-gender-pay-gap&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Labor Department is investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether the company systematically underpays women. It has been sued by former employees who claim they were paid less than men with the same qualifications. And last fall, thousands of Google employees protested the way the company handles sexual harassment claims against top executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Critics said the results of the pay study could give a false impression. Company officials acknowledged that it did not address whether women were hired at a lower pay grade than men with similar qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google seems to be advancing a “flawed and incomplete sense of equality” by making sure men and women receive similar salaries for similar work, said Joelle Emerson, chief executive of Paradigm, a consulting company that advises companies on strategies for increasing diversity. That is not the same as addressing “equity,” she said, which would involve examining the structural hurdles that women face as engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google has denied paying women less, and the company agreed that compensation among similar job titles was not by itself a complete measure of equity. A more difficult issue to solve — one that critics say Google often mismanages for women — is a human resources concept called leveling. Are employees assigned to the appropriate pay grade for their qualifications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company said it was now trying to address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Because leveling, performance ratings and promotion impact pay, this year we are undertaking a comprehensive review of these processes to make sure the outcomes are fair and equitable for all employees,” Lauren Barbato, Google’s lead analyst for pay equity, people analytics, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/ensuring-we-pay-fairly-and-equitably/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To set an employee’s salary, Google starts with an algorithm using factors like performance, location and job. Next, managers can consider subjective factors: Do they believe the employee has a strong future with the company? Is he or she being paid on a par with peers who make similar contributions? Managers must provide a rationale for the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the pay bump is helpful, Google’s critics say it doesn’t come close to matching what a woman would make if she had been assigned to the appropriate pay grade in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kelly Ellis, a former Google engineer and one of the plaintiffs in the gender-pay suit against the company, said in a legal filing that Google had hired her in 2010 as a Level 3 employee — the category for new software engineers who are recent college graduates — despite her four years of experience. Within a few weeks, a male engineer who had also graduated from college four years earlier was hired for Ms. Ellis’s team — as a Level 4 employee. That meant he received a higher salary and had more opportunities for bonuses, raises and stock compensation, according to the suit. Other men on the team whose qualifications were equal to or less than hers were also brought in at Level 4, the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, at the opening of a new company office in Berlin in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tobias Schwarz/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The claim could become a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/technology/google-gender-pay-lawsuit.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;class-action suit representing more than 8,300 current and former female employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The pay study covered 91 percent of Google’s employees and compared their compensation — salaries, bonuses and company stock — within specific job types, job levels, performance and location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was not possible to compare how racial minorities fared in terms of wage adjustments, Google said, because the United States is the only place where the global company tracks workers’ racial backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In response to the study, Google gave $9.7 million in additional compensation to 10,677 employees for this year. Men account for about 69 percent of the company’s work force, but they received a higher percentage of the money. The exact number of men who got raises is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company has done the study every year since 2012. At the end of 2017, it adjusted 228 employees’ salaries by a combined total of about $270,000. This year, new hires were included in the analysis for the first time, which Google said probably explained the big change in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google’s work force, especially in leadership and high-paying technical roles, is overwhelmingly male and mostly white and Asian. Its efforts to increase diversity have touched off &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;an internal culture war&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a widely circulated memo criticizing the company’s diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in upper-tier positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Google fired Mr. Damore, conservatives argued that the company was dominated by people with liberal political and social views. Mr. Damore &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/technology/google-memo-discrimination-lawsuit.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Google, claiming it is biased against white men with conservative views. The matter has been moved to private arbitration. Its status is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said it had 98,771 employees at the end of 2018. The company declined to provide the number of Google employees, but Google is by far the largest part of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google informed employees about the findings of its latest pay study in January at a meeting called to discuss a memo about cost-cutting proposals that had been leaked publicly. The proposals, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-26/google-memo-on-cost-cuts-sparks-heated-debate-inside-company&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported earlier by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, caused an uproar because they included ideas like slowing the pace at which Google promotes workers and eliminating some of its famous perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the meeting, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, played down the proposals as the product of brainstorming by members of the human resources staff and not things that senior managers were seriously considering, according to a video viewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But in an effort to demonstrate that Google was not skimping on wages, executives said at the meeting that the company had adjusted the pay of more employees than ever before. Ms. Barbato, who presented the findings, said that more men were underpaid was a “surprising trend that we didn’t expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Let’s Destroy Robocalls</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/opinion/robocall-scams.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/opinion/robocall-scams.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congress may have found an issue that all Americans can rally around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Stopping robocalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;All right — a little depressing that it can’t be world peace or affordable health care. But let’s take what we can get. If our elected officials could join hands and lead us into a world where phones are no longer an instrument of torture, maybe it’d give them enough confidence to march forward and, um, fund some bridge repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Everybody has always hated telemarketers, particularly the ones trying to sell some shady product. And now the miracles of technology let them follow you around all day. When I’m home, I feel as if I spend half my time blocking robocalls on our landline. Yet somehow a different number always pops up, with great news about opportunities to reinsure my nonexistent car at low prices or acquire a cost-free knee brace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The knee brace thing is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/beware-of-scammers-using-medicare-to-defraud-you.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a scam&lt;/a&gt; to get money out of Medicare, but in order to figure that out you’d have to engage in conversation. People, do not ever talk on the phone with a stranger wielding free knee braces. This can be a life rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Things are at least as bad on mobile phones, which were the lucky recipients of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nearly-48-billion-robocalls-made-in-2018-according-to-youmail-robocall-index-300782638.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;48 billion robocalls in the United States&lt;/a&gt; alone last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congress has been trying to control the problem at least since 1991, when it passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Remember 1991? “Dances With Wolves” won the Oscar for best picture. The Dow closed the year at 3,168. The point I’m trying to make is that it’s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the time the big problem was mainly telemarketers — actual people who dialed your actual number and tried to talk you into buying something. Under the T.C.P.A. you could put your name on a national “do not call” list. Some observers did worry about the part of the plan that required the list be maintained by the telemarketers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Whoops. In 2003 Congress gave the job to the Federal Trade Commission. Then-President George W. Bush signed the bill into law, rejoicing that from then on, when parents were reading to their children at night, they’d no longer be interrupted by “a stranger with a sales pitch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then robocalls really took over the world, and one person on the other side of the planet could push a few buttons and disrupt “Goodnight Moon” from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.T.C. kept saying it could take care of the problem. (“… you can count on us …”) Then the Federal Communications Commission created the Robocall Strike Force in 2016. Great name! Mediocre results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So here we are, tortured phone owners one and all. Perhaps, like me, you’ve accidentally blocked some of your friends without successfully getting rid of the woman with the free knee brace. Perhaps you were like Dr. Gary Pess, a hand surgeon who &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/your-money/robocalls-rise-illegal.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;told The Times’s Tara Siegel Bernard&lt;/a&gt; that he stopped answering any calls when he didn’t recognize the number and then discovered one of them was about a person with a severed thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But good news! We’re getting some action. I know “Congress is working on a bill” is not as encouraging as, say, “Let me pour you a drink and change the subject.” But still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the House, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey has a proposal called Stopping Bad Robocalls, which certainly gets to the point. Pallone is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and it’s fair to say he has a healthy chance of getting something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Things are more problematic in the Senate, which, as you may have noticed, is barely capable of getting its act together long enough to salute the flag. However, Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts — the man who helped give us that Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 — has teamed up with Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota to sponsor a bipartisan plan. It’s called the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, which I certainly hope you noticed spells out Traced. (Or, O.K., Traceda if you wanted to be really technical.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The bill, Markey says, is “a perfect example” of lawmakers from opposite sides of the aisle getting together and “agreeing we don’t want our wireless devices in our pocket to be called by total strangers 10, 15 times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Pretty low bar, yes? Perhaps someday we will see a liberal from California and a conservative from Arkansas get together to fight against people who throw beer bottles out of their car window when they’re in the passing lane on the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But let’s not be cynical. Markey says, “If this bill can’t pass then no bill can pass,” and he’s probably right. You need to root him on, given that the other option is falling back in your chair and moaning, “No bill can pass.” Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The idea is to make telephone companies try much harder to identify and block slimy robocalls. And to bring enforcement groups together to find new ways to prosecute the scammers. I know it doesn’t sound all that dramatic, but if you want people to stop calling you every day with offers to repay your student loans, it’s a better strategy than repeatedly screaming “I graduated in 1980!” into the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The New 30-Something</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/style/financial-independence-30s.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/style/financial-independence-30s.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s the financial riddle of the 30-something years. How does anyone, even those with a stable, upwardly mobile job, let alone a family, afford to live in places like New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco or Washington, D. C.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The answer: Many are bankrolled, to varying degrees, by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hold the eye roll and exasperation about millennials and their failure to launch or the gushing of financial resentment for a moment, and consider the unforgiving economics of trying to make it in this country today. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wages have stagnated&lt;/a&gt;, while real estate, medical and child care costs have skyrocketed. As one economic analysis &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/opinion/buttigieg-2020-millennials.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;concluded recently:&lt;/a&gt; “For Americans under the age of 40, the 21st century has resembled one long recession.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert for &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/about-us&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NerdWallet&lt;/a&gt;, a consumer finance company and app based in San Francisco, said, “A lot of 30-somethings are still getting financial help from their parents, if they are lucky enough to take advantage of it. Incomes today are lower than they were for Gen Xers and boomers at the same point in their lives. Plus, many of the millennials graduated into the recession, and when you hit your 30s, there are a lot of lifestyle changes and expenses, like having kids, getting married and buying a house.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Golden years: Kimberly Palmer decided to have a third child in part because of the 20 to 25 hours of child care that her parents, Gail Shearer and Chris Palmer, give her each month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More than half (53 percent) of Americans ages 21 to 37 have received some form of financial assistance from a parent, guardian or family member since turning 21, according to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/about-us/newsroom/year2018/Failure-to-Launch-Americans-Still-Rely-on-Parents-to-Help-with-Mobile-Phones-Gas-Groceries-and-Health-Insurance.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2018 report&lt;/a&gt; by Country Financial, a financial services firm in Bloomington, Ill. This may include paying bills for a cellphone (41 percent), groceries and gas (32 percent), rent (40 percent) or health insurance (32 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then there are the free services. Ms. Palmer, who is 39 and lives near Washington, D.C., said that the free 20 to 25 hours of child care she receives every month from her parents contributed to her family’s decision to have a third child (Dylan Palmer Davé arrived on Feb. 9). If she were to pay a babysitter, Ms. Palmer estimates it would add up to around $6,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On average, each millennial parent receives $11,011 per year in combined financial support and unpaid labor, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amtd.com/news-and-stories/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/How-Millennial-Parents-Raise-Kids-Without-Risking-Their-Own-Financial-Future/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 2017 TD Ameritrade Millennial Parents Survey found&lt;/a&gt;, for an annual total of $253 billion in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That assistance is crucial for many, according to the study. A quarter of millennial parents receive hourly support from their parents, in the form of child care or household help, and 18 percent of those receiving financial support say they couldn’t afford their current lifestyle without it. Over half of these millennial parents (remember that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/04/more-than-a-million-millennials-are-becoming-moms-each-year/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than a million are becoming mothers every year&lt;/a&gt;) say they have a generalized anxiety about not earning enough to support themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In cities like New York, where private preschool can cost over $30,000 a year, families need special help footing the bill. “Education is incredibly expensive and keeps going up, but grandparents feel very strongly about their grandchildren having a good education,” said Dana Haddad, who runs &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nyadmissions.com/about/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Admissions&lt;/a&gt;, an education consultancy that works with children starting at 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In her practice, Ms. Haddad, a former admissions director at Horace Mann School, estimates that 10 to 15 percent of checks come from grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-11v09nb eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-4948af5b&quot;&gt;Adulting Without a Net&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What it all amounts to is a much different picture, at least in middle-to-upper-class America, from how this age cohort has been viewed in the past. On the television show “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092492/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thirtysomething&lt;/a&gt;,” which aired from 1987 to 1991, the all-white cast of characters seemed to be economically emancipated from their parents, who rarely factored into the story lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today’s series about 30-somethings portray a decade that seems far less adult, at least by traditional standards. (Think “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” or “New Girl.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Behind the jokes about “adulting”; the new fashion for referring to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/fashion/parents-choose-buddy-as-a-nickname-for-their-children.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;male children as “buddy” instead of “son”&lt;/a&gt; (as if still a kid oneself); the performative generational cluelessness about basics like how &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-towels-as-a-couple-you-should-own-a-minimum-of/#IeLJk2DmdPqn&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many towels to own&lt;/a&gt;, is a more serious and divisive question: Have you or haven’t you cut the financial cord with your family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;How they answer portends very different economic outcomes, career paths and life choices. That’s &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they answer. Despite how common it is for a certain set of affluent millennials to be getting help from their parents at an age when many of them are themselves parents, it’s still the last taboo of finance that people don’t want to admit, according to Ms. Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s easier to talk about saving more or being frugal,” she said. “There’s not as much shame around those topics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While it’s true that families with means have always helped their children (discreetly or not), what’s different today is that as the economy has more extreme gyrations and wages flatten, family wealth plays an outsize role in helping people get ahead, said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ips-dc.org/ips-authors/chuck-collins/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chuck Collins&lt;/a&gt;, a scion of the Oscar Mayer food corporation and the author of “Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those who do not have parental assistance in their 30s, however, continue to be at a disadvantage. “They are grappling with paying off student-loan debt, their savings might not be as strong because of that, and many are taking care of other family members,” said Iimay Ho, 32, the executive director at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://resourcegeneration.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resource Generation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that works with people ages 18 to 35 with wealth or class privilege to engage on issues of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ho said there was no way she would have been able to amass the $200,000 she has in net assets if her parents, both of whom immigrated from Taiwan to pursue advanced degrees, hadn’t paid for tuition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, given her close to $100,000 toward buying a condo in Washington, D.C., and continue to give her about $10,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For those without parental cash at the ready, there’s often some kind of debt hangover that holds them back in significant ways. Roger Quesada, 34, calls his $65,000 of student-loan debt to Sallie Mae, which incurs $400 a month in interest payments alone, “a jail sentence.” A lapse in his payments ruined his credit, he said, and has hampered his financial and career aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s been trying to navigate our economy without one of the most important components — good credit — that provides enormous advantages and privileges,” said Mr. Quesada, who grew up working-class in West New York, N.J. “That’s something many in my generation take for granted — graduating debt free.” They also take for granted, he said, financial advice that “native parents with an upper hand economically have. I couldn’t rely on my mother for anything after I left home. She is retired, disabled, barely scraping by, and depends on Social Security. If anything, I need to be helping her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was important to Mr. Quesada that whatever profession he chose would offer a steady income and growth potential for the future. Settling on e-commerce, he is now a merchandising manager at New Avon, earning six figures, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m the son of an immigrant,” Mr. Quesada said. “My life would have been that much harder in Cuba. I feel happy with the success I’ve had.” He lives with his partner in Bergen County, N.J., where his home cost a fraction of what a comparable property would have in New York City, but came with a commute of over two hours to his office in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-11v09nb eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5c855c4d&quot;&gt;The Home Front&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those who do receive parental assistance often do not fit neatly into the stereotype of lazy, entitled millennial. Susan Alvarez, 32, makes over $75,000 as the associate executive director at the Y.M.C.A. of San Diego County. “That is a really decent salary, but it’s still not enough to cover a condo,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So last year Ms. Alvarez’s parents surprised her with a $50,000 cash gift to help with a down payment on a $435,000 condo three blocks from the beach in San Diego. “I grew up middle-class, and my parents immigrated from Cuba,” she said. “They saw that I’ve worked hard but also that I had the bad luck to graduate into the 2008 recession. I didn’t get a job that paid well enough and had benefits until I was 23, which meant I missed out on almost two years of earning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Susan Alvarez at her new apartment with her mother, Sonia Alvarez; her father, Manuel Alvarez; and Fredy Garcia, a real estate broker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Francis Peters for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Evidence suggests that purchasing a home, a life event that many hope to reach in their 30s and one of the primary ways people build wealth, is essentially out of reach in most major cities unless your family has generated a good deal of wealth. (Nationally, homeownership rates &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/25/the-homeownership-rate-is-falling-among-millennials-heres-why.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are falling&lt;/a&gt; for millennials, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/poll-majority-millennials-are-debt-hitting-pause-major-life-events-n862376&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only two in&lt;/a&gt; 10 have a mortgage or home loan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mary Wallace, a real estate agent with Unlimited Sotheby’s International Realty in Boston who works primarily with first-home buyers (and is married to Mr. Collins), said that in 20 years she has rarely seen anyone in their 30s who did not have family help or an inheritance for their down payment. “In our market a buyer is expected to have 20 percent down to compete — that is between $80,000 and $100,000 to become a homeowner,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jessicah Pierre, 27, a media specialist at the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ips-dc.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Institute for Policy Studies&lt;/a&gt;, a progressive think tank, has felt she is on unequal ground. “A friend was telling me how it wasn’t that hard to purchase a home. She was like, ‘Do this, do that,’” said Ms. Pierre, who lives in the Dorchester section of Boston. “But she wasn’t considering the fact that she graduated without any student-loan debt, came from a two-income household, as opposed to me. I am starting with negative wealth because I have loans to pay off and was raised in a family with only one income.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Pierre’s father was an accountant in Haiti and became a cabdriver after immigrating to the United States because his degree wasn’t recognized. (She fully expects that she and her two siblings will take care of him in old age.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No one, as Tom Postilio, a real estate agent in New York at Douglas Elliman, put it, wants to post on Instagram: “‘So glad I could move into this apartment that I don’t make enough money to buy, but thanks Mom and Dad for the cash.’” Mr. Postilio estimates that a quarter of his 30-something clients who are buying larger apartments (over two bedrooms) receive money from their parents, whether it’s in the form of a gift, a low-interest loan or co-purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But there’s a danger in not acknowledging the transfer of wealth (&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/~/media/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Industries_5/Accenture-CM-AWAMS-Wealth-Transfer-Final-June2012-Web-Version.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt; predicted the boomers will ultimately pass along $30 trillion to their millennial children, whether it’s monthly help with living expenses, free child care or receiving the annual gift exclusion of $15,000 from family members). It creates a distorted idea of what it takes to attain success and what financial milestones are actually achievable if you are starting from zero or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Simon Isaacs, 38, a founder of the parenting site &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fatherly.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fatherly&lt;/a&gt;, thinks it’s important to give credit to his family, whose generosity, he said, was instrumental in helping him and his wife buy a home in Brooklyn, where they live with their two young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think millennials need to get past this narrative they’ve made it on their own and ‘I pulled myself up by my boot straps,’” Mr. Isaacs said. “It hides all the kinds of ways they have been privileged by their race or parental help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
