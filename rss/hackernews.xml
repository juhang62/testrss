<title>Android App Reverse Engineering 101</title>
<link>https://maddiestone.github.io/AndroidAppRE/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://maddiestone.github.io/AndroidAppRE/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Android&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; App Reverse Engineering 101! This workshop’s goal is to give you the foundations to begin reverse engineering Android applications. While this workshop won’t teach you the details of Android app development, Android malware analysis, Android vulnerability hunting, etc., I hope to give you all the necessary foundations through this workshop such that you can apply your new Android reversing skills to doing those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will be wholly based on reverse engineering through static analysis, or analyzing and understanding an application by examining its code. I won’t be covering dynamic analysis where an analyst runs an application and understands the application by executing it, debugging it, etc. Why? Static analysis tends to be a less approachable skill for people to pick up on their own, so I want to help you do it! (And I really love static analysis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the exercises in this workshop can be done in the virtual machine (VM) that is available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VM is an Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit image. The username is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AndroidAppRE&lt;/code&gt; and the password is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;android&lt;/code&gt;. The VM has the following tools installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skylot/jadx&quot;&gt;jadx&lt;/a&gt; - Android decompiler. We load the APKs into jadx. And are able to analyze the DEX bytecode using jadx.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghidra-sre.org/&quot;&gt;Ghidra&lt;/a&gt; - Software reverse engineering tool. We use its ARM disassembler/decompiler functionality in the exercises to statically analyze the native libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>JetBlue explains to a passenger how it got a photo of her face</title>
<link>https://boingboing.net/2019/04/23/in-this-twitter-exchange-jetb.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boingboing.net/2019/04/23/in-this-twitter-exchange-jetb.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;73.911384217335&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mediaroom.jetblue.com/investor-relations/press-releases/2018/11-15-2018-184045420&quot;&gt;Your Face is Your Boarding Pass&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is the headline from a jetBlue press release from November 15, 2018. &quot;JetBlue continues to lead the industry as the first domestic airline to launch a fully-integrated biometric self-boarding gate for international flights...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Journalist MacKenzie Fegan had first-hand (first-face?) experience with the new procedure, and when she asked jetBlue about it on Twitter, the extraordinary correspondence resulted:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;11.169811320755&quot;&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;I just boarded an international &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; flight. Instead of scanning my boarding pass or handing over my passport, I looked into a camera before being allowed down the jet bridge. Did facial recognition replace boarding passes, unbeknownst to me? Did I consent to this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mackenzief/status/1118509708673998848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.1063829787234&quot;&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;You're able to opt out of this procedure, MacKenzie. Sorry if this made you feel uncomfortable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— JetBlue Airways (@JetBlue) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue/status/1118512763683385347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.10407239819&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Follow up question. Presumably these facial recognition scanners are matching my image to something in order to verify my identity. How does &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; know what I look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mackenzief/status/1118597524158283776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.16&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;The information is provided by the United States Department of Homeland Security from existing holdings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— JetBlue Airways (@JetBlue) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue/status/1118607244290084864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;11.05035971223&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;So to be clear, the government provided my biometric data to a privately held company? Did I consent to this? How long is my data held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JetBlue&lt;/a&gt;? And even if I opt out at the scanners...you already have my information, correct?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mackenzief/status/1118614203051466762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;11.333333333333&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;We should clarify, these photos aren't provided to us, but are securely transmitted to the Customs and Border Protection database. JetBlue does not have direct access to the photos and doesn’t store them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— JetBlue Airways (@JetBlue) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue/status/1118634258514489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;13.996960486322&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Would love more info about how my image was matched to a name on the flight manifest. I looked at the camera &amp;amp; a few seconds later the gate opened. Was my image, in the space of those seconds, sent to CBP, run through a database, matched to a name, and then sent back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JetBlue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JetBlue&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mackenzief/status/1118648564224339969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;“There is no pre-registration required.” I’ll say! This press release really doesn’t tell me anything about how it works. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EFF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EFF&lt;/a&gt;, can you shed some light on this? How concerned should I be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;— MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mackenzief/status/1118663611260391425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;We found another article that might be interesting to you: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yT1v05VRYX&quot;&gt;https://t.co/yT1v05VRYX&lt;/a&gt; It talks a bit about the data and how it's processed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;“It took her photo, comparing her picture to a preloaded photo database of all the passengers with tickets on this flight.” It sounds like opting out isn’t really an option. I can not go through the scanner, but my data will have already been accessed and loaded into a database.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Self Studying the MIT Applied Math Curriculum</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.harshsikka.me/self-studying-the-mit-applied-math-curriculum/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow! This post blew up, if you'd like to get updates on how my progress goes, feel free to subscribe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harshsikka.me/#subscribe&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HarshSikka&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to engage in a pretty interesting self development project this summer: Completing the requirements for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/applied.php&quot;&gt;MIT Applied Math curriculum&lt;/a&gt; through auditing classes, meeting professors, and completing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm&quot;&gt;corresponding OCW course assignments and exams where applicable&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I'll explain my background and motivations for doing this, as well as the specific courses I'll be taking on my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip straight to the plan if you don't feel like reading the &quot;why&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-hell-would-you-do-this&quot;&gt;Why the hell would you do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a Master's student at Harvard and Georgia Tech studying Machine Learning and Computational Biology. I'm also a research assistant in a few labs, and my work spans Applied Math, Theoretical Neuroscience, and Machine Learning. Previously, I helped start an ML startup. I'm planning on applying to PhD programs this fall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey into Machine Learning has been fairly non traditional, I studied mostly biology and cognitive science in my undergraduate career at UCSD and my internships were always in Product Management. I taught myself to code, mostly application development for web and mobile, and slowly started to see parallels between Information Science and Biology, and was fascinated by Neural Networks. This fascination led me to apply for graduate programs in CS and Biology, and I miraculously was accepted! So, with luck and momentum going my way, I dove deep into deep learning research and taught myself whatever mathematical preliminaries were necessary to make sense of the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I've started to really like math in its own right, and while its certainly not necessary to study large swaths of math beyond a few topics like Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, and a little Vector Calculus, I've found that a lot of the brilliant people around me can dip into different topics in mathematics and make new, interesting breakthroughs in ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I like math, and getting a more formal foundation seems useful if I'd like to go even deeper into the research I'm doing and think in new interesting ways. After talking to a few of my mentors and colleagues, including Professors and Grad students at Harvard and MIT, I was recommended to try diving into an undergraduate applied math curriculum. I've been graciously offered the chance to sit in some classes and learn for the sake of learning in my free time, so why not make a fun project out of it and share it with everyone! Maybe you can find something useful here :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/applied.php&quot;&gt;MIT Applied Math curriculum&lt;/a&gt; is very well laid out and straightforward, and basically comprises of a collection of core courses and electives to choose from. The courses I'll be taking are mostly available via OCW, and some are offered on campus over the summer, or similar material is being taught at nearby universities. The courses I'm planning on taking currently are as follows, and are a sample track fulfilling the degree requirements, though the specific courses may change if I get feedback that something is better suited for my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've included the courses, followed by links to the materials below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-courses&quot;&gt;Core Courses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculus&lt;/strong&gt; - My calculus is quite strong, so I'll likely just review notes and complete the exams for the single and multivariable classes, but the material can be found here - &amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/&quot;&gt;18.01&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/&quot;&gt;18.02&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differential Equations&lt;/strong&gt; - Though I've taken a differential equations class in my undergrad years, I wasn't really paying attention. So, I'll likely focus on this class to fill my foundations -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/&quot;&gt;18.03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/strong&gt; - My Linear Algebra is similarly strong, so again I'll likely focus on reviewing and taking the exams found here -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/&quot;&gt;18.06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Variables with Applications -&lt;/strong&gt; This is a required core course that covers complex algebra and functions, analyticity, contour integration, Cauchy's theorem, singularities, Taylor and Laurent series, residues, evaluation of integrals, multivalued functions, potential theory in two dimensions, Fourier analysis and Laplace transforms. It sounds interesting -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-04-complex-variables-with-applications-fall-2003/&quot;&gt;18.04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles of Discrete Applied Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt; - I've never taken Discrete Math. I taught myself programming and algorithms without a strong mathematical intuition, and I'm looking forward to developing one in this course -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-310-principles-of-discrete-applied-mathematics-fall-2013/&quot;&gt;18.200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles of Continuum Applied Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt; - Principles of Continuum Applied Mathematics covers fundamental concepts in continuous applied mathematics, including applications from traffic flow, fluids, elasticity, granular flows, etc. It also seems largely useful and is a required course so I'll be taking it! -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-311-principles-of-applied-mathematics-spring-2014/&quot;&gt;18.300&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;restricted-electives&quot;&gt;Restricted Electives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the core courses, the curriculum gives students the option of choosing courses from 2 groups, 1. Combinatorics, Computer Science, Probability and Statistics or 2. Numerical Analysis, Physical Mathematics, Nonlinear Dynamics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 courses must be taken, with at least 1 from each group. I'll likely be splitting down the middle, as I already have a Computational background that is provided by some of the classes in the first group. The courses I'm tentatively planning on completing are &lt;strong&gt;Probability&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-440-probability-and-random-variables-spring-2014/&quot;&gt;18.600&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/&quot;&gt;18.650&lt;/a&gt; from the first group, and &lt;strong&gt;Partial Differential Equations&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-303-linear-partial-differential-equations-fall-2006/&quot;&gt;18.303&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Numerical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-330-introduction-to-numerical-analysis-spring-2012/&quot;&gt;18.330&lt;/a&gt; from the 2nd group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's my plan. I'm not shoehorning this into a set period of time, though I will be actively meeting with Professors and auditing classes this summer while completing a research fellowship. I'm really looking forward to exploring and understanding Math, my plan is to share my updates, studies and intuitions here and perhaps they'll even translate into cool new architecture ideas or interesting collaborations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe after this, I'll take a crack at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/pure.php&quot;&gt;Pure Math curriculum&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestions for me? I'd love to hear them, you can drop me a line on Twitter @harshsikka!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TurboTax and H&amp;R Block Saw Free Tax Filing as a Threat</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;Despite signing a deal with the IRS that pledged they would help tens of millions of Americans file taxes for free, tax software giants Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&amp;amp;R Block instead deliberately hid the free option and actively steered customers into paid products, according to an internal document and five current and former employees of the companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block explicitly instructs its customer service staff to push people away from its free offering, according to internal guidance obtained by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;“Do not send clients to this Web Site unless they are specifically calling about the Free File program,” the guidance states, referring to the site with the company’s free option. “We want to send users to our paid products before the free product, if at all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;newsletter newsletter-big-story small right&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Our Top Investigations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;Steering customers away from TurboTax’s truly free option is a “purposeful strategy,” said a former midlevel Intuit employee. For people who find TurboTax through a search engine or an online ad, “the landing page would direct you through a product flow that the company wanted to ensure would not make you aware of Free File.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;When the Free File program launched 16 years ago, it was extolled as the best sort of collaboration between government and private enterprise. With little cost to the IRS, the huge companies that dominate online tax preparation would help millions of Americans file their taxes for free. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-is-about-to-ban-the-government-from-offering-free-online-tax-filing-thank-turbotax&quot;&gt;Intuit and the industry&lt;/a&gt; have spent millions lobbying to make the Free File program permanent because it contains a noncompete provision that restricts the IRS from creating its own free, online filing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;But privately, the free filing option is seen for what it is: a threat to the companies’ profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;So the companies had to strike a delicate balance: They wanted to preserve their arrangement with the IRS to ward off government competition, but then they also sought to make sure the program didn’t recruit too many customers who actually got something for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;The companies set out to convert people who qualify for the program into paying customers. Sure enough, use of the Free File program has collapsed. Soon after it was launched in 2003, more than 5 million Americans filed their taxes for free. Now it’s about half as many, according to the latest IRS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;The industry has also succeeded in fending off a pair of grave dangers: the prospect of the government either creating its own easy online filing system or offering tax returns pre-filled with data the IRS already has, a practice common in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.6&quot;&gt;Now Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block could be dealt a setback. A bill that would codify the Free File program, which passed the House last month, has stalled in the Senate after ProPublica reported that the companies were making it more difficult for people to find their Free File websites by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines&quot;&gt;hiding them from search engines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.7&quot;&gt;Both companies employ similar tactics: They lure customers in with products advertised as “free” but that upsell them to paid products — or hit them with surprise charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.8&quot;&gt;At Intuit, “The entire strategy is make sure people read the word ‘free’ and click our site and never use” an actually free product, the former midlevel employee said. In reality, TurboTax’s Free Edition guides many people to a product that costs them money. It’s only free for people with the simplest tax situations. The “vast majority of people who click that will not pay $0,” the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“TurboTax’s recent ads consist entirely of the word “free”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TurboTax commercial from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GtJPT3F1uw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;Only a small portion of taxpayers, under 3 million a year, find their way to the program, far below the 100 million who actually qualify. The program is open to anyone who makes under $66,000. The IRS, meanwhile, continues to tout the program as a success, despite its decline. Internal IRS documents show agency officials unconcerned that tens of millions of taxpayers have been drawn to other “free” options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;In statements in response to questions from ProPublica, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5984476-Intuit-Statement-5-1-19.html&quot;&gt;Intuit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5985429-HR-Block-5-1-19.html&quot;&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block&lt;/a&gt; both said they were “proud” of the Free File program and cited the fact that millions of taxpayers have used it. They did not specifically address the employee accounts. Intuit’s spokesman said the company “created and paid for 17 marketing initiatives … to raise awareness and educate taxpayers about the IRS Free File program.” He specifically pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2019/04/10/irs-free-file-alliance-offers-free-tax-filing-including-intuit-turbotax-free-file/23709107/&quot;&gt;press release on AOL.com&lt;/a&gt; about the program “syndicated through AOL at our expense to drive awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;The H&amp;amp;R Block spokeswoman said the company’s Free File offering grew 8.3% this year, and “we have updated our search practices to make H&amp;amp;R Block’s Free File offer even easier to find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;An IRS spokesman said the agency “continues to support the Free File program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;At Intuit, it’s an open secret within the company that helping customers find the Free File program would be bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;One former marketing employee recalled a May 2017 meeting of a marketing team at TurboTax’s San Diego headquarters. The tax filing season had just ended, and a dozen or so staffers up to the senior manager level were brainstorming. A new employee proposed that customers going through TurboTax’s interview-style filing process who were found to be eligible for Free File get a “hard recommendation” — essentially a pop-up window — to be routed to the truly free product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.6&quot;&gt;The response? Laughter, according to the former employee. The meeting quickly moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.7&quot;&gt;“They have ways of detecting if you’re paying too much, but they just don’t do it,” the former staffer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.8&quot;&gt;As a result, many people end up paying TurboTax even though they could have filed for free. The company won’t say how many people this is, but it is likely in the millions. Dozens of taxpayers have contacted ProPublica to tell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/here-are-your-stories-of-being-tricked-into-paying-by-turbotax-you-often-need-the-money&quot;&gt;their stories of being charged by TurboTax&lt;/a&gt; despite the fact that they earned under $34,000 a year, qualifying them for TurboTax’s Free File product. An 87-year-old retiree with a gross income of $11,000, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/here-are-your-stories-of-being-tricked-into-paying-by-turbotax-you-often-need-the-money&quot;&gt;was charged $124.98&lt;/a&gt; to file with TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block tells staff to steer people away from Free File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block instructs its staff to push people toward its paid products in this internal guidance obtained by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/HRB-screenshot.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/HRB-screenshot.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/HRB-screenshot.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/HRB-screenshot.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/HRB-screenshot.jpg 2000w&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.0&quot;&gt;At H&amp;amp;R Block, a former veteran staffer called it “company policy” to steer customers away from the Free File option. “The company is making money from the product, and that money is eating into the clients’ refund,” the former staffer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.1&quot;&gt;At Intuit, customers who don’t know about the Free File product will find themselves instead on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes&quot;&gt;Free Edition&lt;/a&gt;.” There, they are often pushed to buy deluxe versions of TurboTax they might not need. They can be charged a $39.99 “Refund Processing” fee to have the cost of TurboTax deducted from their refund instead of paying upfront. They are also sold side products such as “audit defense,” which offers expert representation in the event of an audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.2&quot;&gt;Executives who have worked at the company boast on resumes reviewed by ProPublica about their success in having diverted customers from “free” offerings to paying products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.3&quot;&gt;One former marketing manager described her role as “driving new business growth” through TurboTax Free Edition “while mitigating cannibalization of our paid tax offerings.” Another senior product marketing manager boasted that she had helped develop the “monetization strategy of the TurboTax Free Edition product.” She said she applied the principles of the behavioral economist &lt;a href=&quot;http://danariely.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Ariely&lt;/a&gt; to enhance “TurboTax in-product upsell experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.4&quot;&gt;On LinkedIn, Heather Samarin, who was a TurboTax vice president of product management a decade ago, said that she had been “charged with addressing the threat posed by IRS free efile program” and had “revamped TurboTax marketing strategy for low-end tax filers,” driving a “100% increase in revenues.” She did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;At a meeting in 2014, Intuit’s then-Chief Financial Officer Neil Williams described the prospect of the IRS adopting a system of pre-filled returns as an “existential threat” to the company, according to the former midlevel staffer. Williams didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.6&quot;&gt;Last summer, according to a former marketing employee, the then-head of TurboTax, Dan Wernikoff, attended a meeting about customers who had unnecessarily selected costlier products like TurboTax Deluxe. These customers had tax situations that qualified them for a cheaper or even free product, and the slides shown at the meeting referred to them as having been “overcharged.” According to the former employee, Wernikoff instructed that going forward, employees should never use the word “overcharged.” Instead, they should say that these customers’ use of products intended for higher-earning customers was “aspirational.” Wernikoff didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.7&quot;&gt;The IRS’ Free File program peaked early. In 2005, its third year, 5.1 million taxpayers used the program to file a free return. That early success set the program up for plenty of growth, as every year, millions more Americans were moving away from paper to file their tax returns electronically. In 2005, only 68.5 million returns were filed electronically — about half the number filed electronically last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.8&quot;&gt;But instead of growing, Free File shrank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pym-src=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-free-file-percent?layout=embed&amp;amp;050219&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.0&quot;&gt;At the IRS, according to internal management reports obtained by ProPublica through a public records request, executives were ambivalent about the program’s decline. The reason for the drop was that companies “now heavily promote free options outside of IRS Free File,” said a report in November 2009. Two years later, as the numbers slid further, a report blamed the “continued migration of taxpayers to other online free services offered in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.1&quot;&gt;By 2017, after the number of Free File users had been cut in half from its 2005 peak, IRS executives were claiming the program’s decline was instead proof of its success. As a November 2017 internal report put it: “We believe the continued decrease is a direct result of the increase in free options available in the broad marketplace. Free File has been successful in generating a free marketplace and stimulating that marketplace, perhaps to the program’s detriment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.2&quot;&gt;Yet the same report conceded that the IRS did not have a “quantitative understanding for the decrease in Free File returns” — in other words, the agency had never actually studied why or how taxpayers were lured to other options in the “free marketplace” or whether those options were actually free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.3&quot;&gt;One year later, an IRS oversight panel contradicted the report’s rosy conclusions. The panel wrote that the agency “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5910811-Internal-Revenue-Service-Advisory-Council.html#document/p15/a494005&quot;&gt;does not provide adequate oversight of the Free File program&lt;/a&gt;” and that by failing to have clear goals for the program or checking to make sure the companies were following through on their promises, the IRS was putting “vulnerable taxpayers at risk.” Despite the panel’s criticism, the IRS has not announced any significant reforms to oversight of the program. Last October, the IRS signed a deal with Intuit and the other companies renewing the Free File program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.0&quot;&gt;Intuit’s aggressive lobbying of Congress on tax filing issues is well known inside the company, but it is a topic most employees shy away from discussing openly, according to a former Intuit engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.1&quot;&gt;One employee recalled longtime Intuit CEO Brad Smith, a folksy leader who often invokes his roots in West Virginia, batting back a question at an employee Q&amp;amp;A about whether the IRS should offer Americans pre-filled tax returns. If that happened, Smith argued, the government would take advantage of people, especially those who don’t speak English. A company spokesman didn’t respond to a question about the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.2&quot;&gt;Smith presided over a decade of dramatic growth at Intuit before he was succeeded by Sasan Goodarzi this year. Last year, Intuit’s consumer division, which includes TurboTax, reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5955655-Intuit-2018-Annual-Report-on-Form-10-K-PDF.html#document/p41&quot;&gt;$1.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.3&quot;&gt;After ProPublica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-get-turbotax-refund&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that many people had been charged even though they were eligible to file for free, dozens of readers reported receiving refunds. But in recent days, the company created a special team to handle — and deny — refund requests, according to customer service representatives working for Intuit subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.4&quot;&gt;Customer service staff reported being told to blame the 2017 Trump tax law for customers being charged. Multiple readers said they’d been told that the ProPublica stories were “fake news.” Intuit has not answered repeated questions about its refund policy. A spokesman said that no material provided to call agents “included a reference to tax law changes, elected officials or derogatory terms about ProPublica.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, calls to investigate the industry’s attempts to steer taxpayers away from the Free File program are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.0&quot;&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/P000618-katie-porter&quot;&gt;Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepKatiePorter/status/1122890519636582401&quot;&gt;wrote letters asking&lt;/a&gt; the IRS and Federal Trade Commission to investigate Intuit’s and H&amp;amp;R Block’s attempts to hide their Free File pages from search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.1&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo requested two state agencies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-calls-department-financial-services-and-department-taxation-and-finance&quot;&gt;open an investigation&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Intuit spokesman said: “Our search and marketing practices around the IRS Free File program have been called into question. These characterizations are untrue and we look forward to sharing the facts with New York regulators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.2&quot;&gt;The spokesman didn’t respond to requests to specify which characterizations were untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8ab&quot; id=&quot;f8ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article &lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/lispy.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://norvig.com/lispy.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about creating a lisp interpreter in Python&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8677&quot; id=&quot;8677&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f8c&quot; id=&quot;4f8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.&lt;/strong&gt; In this essay you and I will follow along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/lispy.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://norvig.com/lispy.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norvig’s Lispy&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;dcf6&quot; id=&quot;dcf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Syntax, Semantics and Notes on Following Along&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7011&quot; id=&quot;7011&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;), alongside some &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2&quot; data-href=&quot;https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rich Hickey talks&lt;/a&gt; will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1f4&quot; id=&quot;f1f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;ede5&quot; id=&quot;ede5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7c30&quot; id=&quot;7c30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;a422&quot; id=&quot;a422&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4faf&quot; id=&quot;4faf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;49ee&quot; id=&quot;49ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Language 1: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--h3-em&quot;&gt;Just a Risp calculator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e628&quot; id=&quot;e628&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b34&quot; id=&quot;3b34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we’ll &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; support addition and subtraction.&lt;/strong&gt; No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1cbd&quot; id=&quot;1cbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;c05a&quot; id=&quot;c05a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
(+ 10 5 2) //=&amp;gt; 17&lt;br/&gt;(- 10 5 2) //=&amp;gt; 3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69ac&quot; id=&quot;69ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f9f6&quot; id=&quot;f9f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;our program&lt;/em&gt; ⟶ &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ⟶ &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;abstract syntax tree&lt;/em&gt; ⟶ &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ⟶ &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;result&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bdcb&quot; id=&quot;bdcb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will need to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/strong&gt; our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/strong&gt; the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b684&quot; id=&quot;b684&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Type Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a1c6&quot; id=&quot;a1c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Risp can have three kinds of values for now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b2e7&quot; id=&quot;b2e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We’ll also need an error type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;07a8&quot; id=&quot;07a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Finally, we’ll need an &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; type. This is where we will store defined variables, built-in functions, and so forth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;8e08&quot; id=&quot;8e08&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Parsing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e017&quot; id=&quot;e017&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Our goal is to take our program, and build an abstract syntax tree from it. For us, that is going to be a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, first we will take our program, and cut it up into a bunch of tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;6720&quot; id=&quot;6720&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
tokenize(&quot;(+ 10 5)&quot;) //=&amp;gt; [&quot;(&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;)&quot;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3664&quot; id=&quot;3664&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Here’s how we can do that in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;02b6&quot; id=&quot;02b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, we can parse these tokens, into a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9a3a&quot; id=&quot;9a3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;I depart slightly from Norvig’s implementation, by using a “start” position, and returning a “next” position. This lets us recurse and parse nested lists, without mutating the tokens vec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7b8&quot; id=&quot;d7b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We get the token for the current position. If it’s the beginning of a list “(“, we start reading and parsing the tokens that follow, until we hit a closing parenthesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5238&quot; id=&quot;5238&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If it’s a closing tag of a list “)”, we return an error, as read_seq should have skipped past it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1d7&quot; id=&quot;f1d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Otherwise, it can only be an atom, so we parse that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;e394&quot; id=&quot;e394&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6c6&quot; id=&quot;a6c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Let’s go ahead and create the default, global environment. As Norvig explains, environments are where we will store variable definitions and built-in functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d77c&quot; id=&quot;d77c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To implement built-in operations &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;(+, -)&lt;/code&gt;, we need a way to save rust function references. Let’s update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt;, so that we can store rust function references:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3260&quot; id=&quot;3260&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, we can create a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;default_env&lt;/code&gt; function, that returns a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispEnv&lt;/code&gt;, which implements +, and -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;fbed&quot; id=&quot;fbed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;I am following Clojure’s spec for + and -.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;44d9&quot; id=&quot;44d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To make this simpler, I made a quick helper, which enforces that all &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt; that we receive are floats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;fd59&quot; id=&quot;fd59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;80cf&quot; id=&quot;80cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now, time to implement &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eval.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;04e5&quot; id=&quot;04e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If it’s a symbol, we’ll query for that symbol in the environment and return it (for now, it should be a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp::Func&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce34&quot; id=&quot;ce34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If it’s a number, we’ll simply return it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9bd3&quot; id=&quot;9bd3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If it’s a list, we’ll evaluate the first form. It should be a &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp::Func&lt;/code&gt;. Then, we’ll call that function with all the other evaluated forms as the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;635b&quot; id=&quot;635b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Aand, bam, we have eval.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f643&quot; id=&quot;f643&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Repl&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4eeb&quot; id=&quot;4eeb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now, to make this fun and interactive, let’s make a repl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;280d&quot; id=&quot;280d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We first need a way to convert our &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt; to a string. Let’s implement the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;to_string&lt;/code&gt; trait&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2eee&quot; id=&quot;2eee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, let’s tie the interpreter process into a loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;b63a&quot; id=&quot;b63a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Aand, voila, language 1.0 is done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/22b4b06b8263687d7178f61fb22e1bf2&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/22b4b06b8263687d7178f61fb22e1bf2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s the code so far&lt;/a&gt; 🙂&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32dc&quot; id=&quot;32dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We can now add and subtract!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;1cb4&quot; id=&quot;1cb4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--pre-code&quot;&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(+ 10 5 (- 10 3 3))&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; 19&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b949&quot; id=&quot;b949&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Language 1.1: Risp calculator++&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35aa&quot; id=&quot;35aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Okay, we have a basic calculator. Now, let’s add support for booleans, and introduce some equality comparators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;43c8&quot; id=&quot;43c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To implement bools, let’s include it in our &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;45e3&quot; id=&quot;45e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Rust will tell us to update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;ToString&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c6ad&quot; id=&quot;c6ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then Rust will tell us we should change &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;, to consider bools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bdd0&quot; id=&quot;bdd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s also update our &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;parse_atom&lt;/code&gt; function, to consider bools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;7e9e&quot; id=&quot;7e9e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Now, we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be good to go. To really see these in action though, let’s implement &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;=, &amp;gt;, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;=, &amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;c5e3&quot; id=&quot;c5e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Comparison Operators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9568&quot; id=&quot;9568&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;In clojure, these comparison operators are a bit special. They can take more than 2 args, and return true if they are in a monotonic order that satisfies the operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6276&quot; id=&quot;6276&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For example &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;(&amp;gt; 6 5 3 2)&lt;/code&gt; is true, because 6 &amp;gt; 5 &amp;gt; 3 &amp;gt; 2. Let’s do this for Risp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b2a6&quot; id=&quot;b2a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The key here is our helper macro &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;ensure_tonicty&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a checker function, and ensures that the conditional passes in a monotonic way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;be5a&quot; id=&quot;be5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Aand, voila, language 1.1 is done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/ddedb35ca7fc9ea5dd320c218e9054c8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/ddedb35ca7fc9ea5dd320c218e9054c8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s the code so far&lt;/a&gt; 🙂&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a737&quot; id=&quot;a737&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We can now use comparators, and see booleans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;2c0b&quot; id=&quot;2c0b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--pre-code&quot;&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(&amp;gt; 6 4 3 1)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;14c4&quot; id=&quot;14c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Language 1.2: Almost Risp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bcda&quot; id=&quot;bcda&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Okay, now, let’s make this a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;language.&lt;/em&gt; Let’s introduce &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9db1&quot; id=&quot;9db1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To do this, let’s update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; to deal with built-in operators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;53f8&quot; id=&quot;53f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We take the first form, and try to eval it as a built-in. If we can, voila, otherwise we evaluate as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3128&quot; id=&quot;3128&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s how &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval_built_in_form&lt;/code&gt; looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;43bd&quot; id=&quot;43bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;if&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e50f&quot; id=&quot;e50f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Here’s how we can implement if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;4d91&quot; id=&quot;4d91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;def&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6cd7&quot; id=&quot;6cd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;And here’s def:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;7e46&quot; id=&quot;7e46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Aand bam, language 1.2 is done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/b862ed8ee719d8532f5c5cdb1bd2867f&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/b862ed8ee719d8532f5c5cdb1bd2867f&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s the code so far&lt;/a&gt; 🙂&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2510&quot; id=&quot;2510&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We now have some coool built-in functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;8752&quot; id=&quot;8752&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--pre-code&quot;&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(def a 1)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; a&lt;br/&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(+ a 1)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; 2&lt;br/&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(if (&amp;gt; 2 4 6) 1 2)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; 2&lt;br/&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(if (&amp;lt; 2 4 6) 1 2)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5891&quot; id=&quot;5891&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Language 2: Full Risp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a287&quot; id=&quot;a287&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Now, let’s make this a full-on language. Let’s implement &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;lambdas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;! Our syntax can look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;a660&quot; id=&quot;a660&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--pre-code&quot;&gt;(def add-one (fn (a) (+ 1 a)))&lt;br/&gt;(add-one 1) // =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;910f&quot; id=&quot;910f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;First, create the lambda expression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d565&quot; id=&quot;d565&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;First things first, let’s introduce a Lambda type for our RispExp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c6a9&quot; id=&quot;c6a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Rust will tell us to update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;ToString&lt;/code&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3dfd&quot; id=&quot;3dfd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then Rust will tell us to update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;6913&quot; id=&quot;6913&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, support the built-in constructor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d81&quot; id=&quot;4d81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now, let’s update &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;eval,&lt;/strong&gt; to handle fn — this will be the built-in call that creates a Lambda expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bd4f&quot; id=&quot;bd4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval_lambda_args&lt;/code&gt; can look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;06d9&quot; id=&quot;06d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, let’s support scoped environments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1182&quot; id=&quot;1182&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;For now we only have a global environment. To support lambdas, we need to introduce the concept of scoped environments. Whenever we call a lambda, we’ll need to instantiate a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e60d&quot; id=&quot;e60d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To do this, let’s first update our &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispEnv&lt;/code&gt; struct, to keep an outer reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1ebd&quot; id=&quot;1ebd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;default_env&lt;/code&gt;, to specify the lifetime and return None as the outer environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5a0d&quot; id=&quot;5a0d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, let’s update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;, to recursively search for symbols in our environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;f666&quot; id=&quot;f666&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Finally, let’s support calling lambdas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;70a1&quot; id=&quot;70a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Let’s update &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;, so that we know what to do when the first form in a list is a lambda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ef7c&quot; id=&quot;ef7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We first have a quick helper function to eval a list of expressions, as we’ll be doing that both for &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp::Func&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;RispExp::Lambda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a966&quot; id=&quot;a966&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then, we create a function call &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;env_for_lambda&lt;/code&gt;. This will get the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;params_exp&lt;/code&gt;, and create an environment, where each param corresponds to the argument at that index:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c896&quot; id=&quot;c896&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;To do this, we need the helper &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;parse_list_of_symbol_strings&lt;/code&gt;, to make sure all of our param definitions are in fact symbols:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;262f&quot; id=&quot;262f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With that, we can &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;eval(lambda.body_exp, new_env)&lt;/code&gt;, and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5f85&quot; id=&quot;5f85&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Voila…language 2.0 is done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/28b7322eecddf17766e2ee3fa3939cf6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/stopachka/28b7322eecddf17766e2ee3fa3939cf6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Take a look at the code so far&lt;/a&gt; 🙂&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5686&quot; id=&quot;5686&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We now support lambdas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;82c4&quot; id=&quot;82c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--pre-code&quot;&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(def add-one (fn (a) (+ 1 a)))&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; add-one&lt;br/&gt;risp &amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;(add-one 1)&lt;br/&gt;// 🔥 =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;dd7b&quot; id=&quot;dd7b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Fin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1561&quot; id=&quot;1561&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;And with that, we’ve reached the end of this adventure. I hope it’s been fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1318&quot; id=&quot;1318&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s still a bunch more to implement, and ways we can make this even more elegant. If you get to it, send me your thoughts 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f690&quot; id=&quot;f690&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Finally, I have to say, I loved using Rust. It’s the least mental overhead I’ve had to maintain with a systems language, and it was a blast to use. The community is alive and well, plus — &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book&quot; data-href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their guides are phenomenal&lt;/a&gt;! Give it a shot if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Will Soon Let Users Automatically Scrub Location and Web History</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/google-will-soon-let-you-automatically-scrub-your-location</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/google-will-soon-let-you-automatically-scrub-your-location</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;41.060975609756&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that Google tracks a lot of data about you, from the websites you visit to the videos you watch, the things you’ve searched for, and the places you have visited. Scrubbing this data from your Google account has required you to manually dig into your settings each time. That’s changing soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, Google will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/automatically-delete-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolling out&lt;/a&gt; a feature to users around the world that will let them set this information to be deleted automatically every three or 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;53.442020665901&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We work to keep your data private and secure, and we’ve heard your feedback that we need to provide simpler ways for you to manage or delete it,&quot; Google said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/automatically-delete-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, these controls are only coming to your location history and web and app activity, but it’s likely that they’ll come to more of your data history at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrubbing this information from your Google account will make using Google services slightly less useful. After all, Google uses the data it collects about you to personalize its services by recommending restaurants, movies, music; adding appointments to your calendar; telling you whether it’s going to rain in your city; and, of course, serving you ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, being able to get a giant corporation that guzzles all of your data to delete it periodically is a definite plus for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build safety, share vulnerability, establish purpose.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kate Matsudaira&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my career leading teams, I have worked with large organizations (more than 1,000 people) and super-small teams (a startup with just two people). I have seen that the best teams have one thing in common: a strong team culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know what it is like to be a part of a great team—when you enjoy coming together and the energy is electric. There is something special that happens when the team becomes greater than the sum of the individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really inspired by this topic recently when I read Daniel Coyle's book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://danielcoyle.com/the-culture-code/&quot;&gt;The Culture Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The author shares a lot of research (and I do love data) about what makes a great team. He boils it down to a few key elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Build safety. Create an environment where people feel safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Share vulnerability. When people are willing to take risks, it can drive cooperation and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Establish purpose. The team should align around common goals and values, with a clear path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is filled with many examples and ideas, but in my experience, I have seen that what works for one team won't work for another. That is one of the reasons leadership is complex and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are always working with different variables—different teams, different companies, different goals. And yet team culture is one part of the job that great leaders never ignore. So, how do the best leaders create team culture wherever they go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;See the Role You Play in Team Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leader, it is your responsibility to set the culture for the team. I am sure you have heard the phrase &quot;lead by example,&quot; and that is because when people aren't sure what is acceptable, they look to their leaders for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have surely been in the situation where you have seen your manager staying late at the office, and as a result, you might have stayed just a little longer. On the other hand, if you frequently saw your boss taking two-hour lunches, you might not be in such a hurry to get back to the office when your friend stops by to go to lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, people are looking for signals in their environment about what is the norm. As a leader, it is part of your job to set the example for those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to create a culture where people are engaged, cooperative, and excited. To do this, you need to be deliberate in your actions. For example, if you want to create a culture of psychological safety, where people can speak up and take risks, it is important that you don't accept or participate in negativity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237683988_How_When_and_Why_Bad_Apples_Spoil_the_Barrel_Negative_Group_Members_and_Dysfunctional_Groups&quot;&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that one bad apple or toxic employee can bring down the whole team.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, if you see or hear someone acting in opposition to the attitude and environment you are trying to create, you should do your best to diffuse the situation and address the individual quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ignore your team culture or think it's not an important part of your job, some type of culture will still develop. That is just what happens when humans work together and share a space. The leader's job is to cultivate the type of culture that will lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Creating Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once on a leadership team that had a very negative dynamic—the manager had a tendency to play favorites, so many of my peers were always trying to win favor by badmouthing or undermining the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being very frustrated that this was allowed to happen and decided that whenever someone came to me to complain about another team member, instead of sharing that feedback, I would coach the complainer to tell the other person directly. If the complaint was about how a peer was managing a project, I would talk about how that person could improve and come up with a plan for the complainer to help that other person succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was reacting to the problems I saw, but in retrospect, I realized that my actions ended up creating a cohesive team—one where people were encouraged to help one another, and if they disagreed, would always try to sort it out themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader should help create mutual vulnerability among team members. This can be done in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Force collaboration. Have team members work together to solve a problem or complete a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Encourage people to talk to one another directly. Foster an environment of peer coaching and resist being a proxy for critical feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Reward and recognize collaboration. Drive for shared outcomes that celebrate team successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Build trust. Create opportunities (e.g. summits or meetings) for people to build trust with one another and get to know each another as people—not just as coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more strategies, but the key is to create opportunities where people can connect. Help build trust among team members by allowing them to resolve their own conflicts without you being the mediator. Over time, this will create a group of people who can trust one another, which, in turn, will create a cohesive team culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Define Your Culture by Knowing its Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a team culture is not an easy job. Once a culture has been established, it is easy to see its signposts. But when you are new to a team or working to develop a positive team culture, it can be challenging to know exactly what it takes to build a culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start picking rituals and values that you think &quot;sound&quot; good, start by going back to the very beginning. Ask yourself, &lt;em&gt;What is the value of this team?&lt;/em&gt; Really think about it. &lt;em&gt;Why does this team exist?&lt;/em&gt; Think beyond the function that the team serves for the organization as a whole (e.g., coding or design). &lt;em&gt;Why are we a team?&lt;/em&gt; The answer to this question is not always clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other questions to consider: What are the advantages of being a team? What can we do because we are working together? Maybe it is so team members can learn from each other and do better work; there is more learning when there is collaboration. Maybe it is decision making; we make smarter decisions when we have multiple viewpoints. Maybe it is about resources; we can do more with combined skills and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Create Cultural Touchpoints Around Your Values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know the value of your team, then you can start building in elements that support its values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you decide that one of the values of your team is peer mentoring; in other words, one of the reasons your team exists is so that its members can do better work by learning from one another. Now, how do you make that happen on your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot just say &quot;We learn from each other&quot; during a meeting and make it happen. You have to institute processes that make this a simple part of daily life on your team. Think about which kinds of forums you can set up to help people learn from one another. Do you want to encourage questions in team chat? Set up a code-review process? Establish a cadence of brown bags to share lessons learned? Read whitepapers and discuss them as a group? What makes sense for your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's say that another value of your team is decision-making; your team exists because everyone's input helps to make smarter decisions about what to work on and how to work on it. We all know that the more people are involved in a decision, the more complicated it becomes to get a clear answer. So, how do you benefit from getting everyone's input without becoming a team that can get nothing done because no one can agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution might be to have all decision-making done in the same way. For example, you might institute a format for all reports. That way, the input from various individuals or departments will all come to you in the exact same way, so you can quickly parse the information and make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Team Structure Becomes Team Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team culture is not just wearing the same t-shirts at the company picnic. The way you do things every day is what builds your culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while streamlining the way your team formats their reports might not feel like it has much to do with team culture, it does. It is a way of steering your team to work together, by prioritizing the values that your team supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is in the everyday. It is the small actions that you and everyone on your team takes on a daily basis—the way they speak to each other, the way decisions get made, the way they run meetings—that make up your team culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many amazing examples of culture-building throughout my career. Here are just a few more ideas that might inspire you as you build your team culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Weekly demo meetings. Have someone from the team share a recent accomplishment. This could be a big thing, or even something as small as changing a button color on the website. This creates a culture of sharing work so that people feel more collaborative even outside the meeting setting, since they know what other people are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Teaching slots for every team member. At every team meeting, have people sign up to share something they've learned recently or teach something to the team. This is a great way for people who have been to conferences or read interesting books to share that knowledge, and it helps give everyone on the team a voice (even those who don't normally speak up during meetings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Cupcakes for launches. Mark every team win by bringing people together—literally together, around a plate of cupcakes, instead of just via email. This creates a culture of celebration, where people's successes are noticed and rewarded, and where the whole team celebrates together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the decisions you make will feel big and some will feel small. But whether it's as huge as developing an online help tool for your team or as small as sharing cupcakes after a big win, the effect is the same. Culture comes from shared experiences. The &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; doesn't matter nearly as much as the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you make people feel like they are valued and important parts of the team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let the Culture Expand from the Top Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As leader of the team, you have significant influence over your team's culture. You can institute policies and procedures that help make your team happy and productive, monitor team successes, and continually improve the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important part of team culture, however, is helping people feel they are a part of creating it. How can you expand the job of creating a culture to other team members?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for opportunities to delegate whenever you can. If a holiday is coming up, maybe you could ask a team member to help organize a team dinner. Look for people with unique perspectives (who maybe aren't heard from as often as others) and give them a platform to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where truly great leadership comes from. You establish a culture that enables your team to be the best it can be, and then you allow the team to take that culture and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How amazing could your team be with just a few adjustments?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe’s fifth engineering hub is Remote</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Stripe has engineering hubs in San Francisco, Seattle, Dublin, and Singapore. We are establishing a fifth hub that is less traditional but no less important: Remote. We are doing this to situate product development closer to our customers, improve our ability to tap the 99.74% of talented engineers living outside the metro areas of our first four hubs, and further our mission of increasing the GDP of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe will hire over a hundred remote engineers this year. They will be deployed across every major engineering workstream at Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-users-are-everywhere-we-have-to-be-too&quot;&gt;Our users are everywhere. We have to be, too.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our remotes keep us close to our customers, which is key to building great products. They are deeply embedded in the rhythms of their cities. They see how people purchase food differently in bodegas, konbini, and darshinis. They know why it is important to engineer robustness in the face of slow, unreliable internet connections. They have worked in and run businesses that don’t have access to global payments infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe has had hundreds of extremely high-impact remote employees since inception. Historically, they’ve reported into teams based in one of our hubs. We had a strong preference for managers to be located in-office and for teams to be office-centric, to maximize face-to-face bandwidth when doing creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have grown as a company, we have learned some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that the technological substrate of collaboration has gotten &lt;em&gt;shockingly&lt;/em&gt; good over the last decade. Most engineering work at Stripe happens in conversations between engineers, quiet thinking, and turning those thoughts into artifacts. Of these, thinking is the only one that doesn’t primarily happen online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when writing on a whiteboard had substantially higher bandwidth than a Word doc over email. Thankfully Google Docs, Slack, git, Zoom, and the like deliver high-bandwidth synchronous collaboration on creative work. The experience of using them is so remarkably good that we only notice it when something is broken. Since you write code via pull requests and not whiteboards, your reviewer needs to have access to the same PR; having access to the same whiteboard is strictly optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we did not initially plan to make hiring remotes a huge part of our engineering efforts, our remote employees have outperformed all expectations. Foundational elements of the Stripe technology stack, our products, our business, and our culture were contributed by remotes. We would be a greatly diminished company without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stripes-new-remote-engineering-hub&quot;&gt;Stripe’s new remote engineering hub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen such promising results from our remote engineers that we are greatly increasing our investment in remote engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are formalizing our Remote engineering hub.&lt;/strong&gt; It is coequal with our physical hubs, and will benefit from some of our experience in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng&quot;&gt;scaling engineering organizations&lt;/a&gt;. For example, there will be dedicated engineering teams in the Remote hub that exist in no other hub. (Some individuals report to a team located in a different hub, and we expect this will remain common, but the bulk of high-bandwidth coworker relationships are within-hub.) We also have a remote engineering lead, analogous to the site leads we have for our physical hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are expanding the scope we will hire for remotely&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to hiring engineers, we plan to begin hiring remote product managers, engineering managers, and technical program managers later this year. (We will continue hiring remote employees in non-engineering positions across the company as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We intend to expand our remote engineering hiring aggressively.&lt;/strong&gt; We will hire at least a hundred remote engineers this year. We expect to be constrained primarily by our capacity to onboard and support new remote engineers, and we will work to increase that capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will continue to improve the experience of being a remote.&lt;/strong&gt; We have carefully tracked the experience of our remote employees, including in our twice-annual employee survey. Most recently, 73% of engineers at Stripe believe we do a good job of integrating remote employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great user experiences are made in the tiny details. We care about the details to a degree that is borderline obsessive. A recent example: we wrote code to attach a videoconferencing link to every calendar invitation by default, so that remotes never feel awkward having to ask for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-to-come&quot;&gt;More to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still some constraints on our ambitions. In our first phase, we will be focused primarily on remote engineers in North America, starting with the US and Canada. While we are confident that great work is possible within close time zones, we don’t yet have structures to give remotes a reliably good experience working across large time zone differences. And though we intend to hire remote engineers in Europe and Asia eventually, our hubs in Dublin and Singapore are not sufficiently established to support remotes just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most engineers working at Stripe are full-time employees, with a full benefits suite. There is substantial organizational, legal, and financial infrastructure required to support each new jurisdiction we hire in, so we have to be measured in how quickly we expand. We can support most US states today, and plan to expand our hiring capabilities to include jurisdictions covering more than 90% of the US population as quickly as possible. We intend, over the longer term, to be everywhere our customers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue encouraging governments worldwide to lower barriers to hiring. Our customers, from startups to international conglomerates, all feel the pain of this. We think making it easier for companies to hire would produce a step-function increase in global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-want-to-talk-to-you&quot;&gt;We want to talk to you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to talk about our Remote hub or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/jobs/search?l=remote&quot;&gt;remote positions at Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. Our CEO and co-founder, Patrick Collison, and I will host a remote coffee on May 22, 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.events/remote-coffee&quot;&gt;sign up to be invited&lt;/a&gt; to it. We are also, and always, available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
