&lt;header&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/&quot;&gt;Standard Ebooks&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;nav/&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ereaders with a Standard Ebook open.&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/devices.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Ebooks is a volunteer driven, not-for-profit project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebook projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Ebooks aren’t just a beautiful addition to your digital library—they’re a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button next&quot; href=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/&quot;&gt;Browse our library of free ebooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What makes Standard Ebooks different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Modern &amp;amp; consistent typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9.6367521367521&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.455128205128&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use &quot;straight&quot; quotes instead of “curly” quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Ebooks project applies a rigorous and modern &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/contribute/typography&quot;&gt;typography manual&lt;/a&gt; when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;An example of bad typography.&quot; class=&quot;bottom&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/typography-bad.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;An example of Standard Ebooks typography.&quot; class=&quot;top&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/typography-good.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;An arrow pointing from bad typography to good typography.&quot; class=&quot;arrow&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/arrow-down.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Full proofing with careful corrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A text with proofreader's marks.&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/proofreading.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rich &amp;amp; detailed metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ebooks include complete, well-researched, and consistent metadata, including original, detailed book blurbs and links to encyclopedia sources. Perfect for machine processing or for extra-curious, technically-minded readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;An application dialog displaying ebook metadata.&quot; class=&quot;top&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/metadata.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;State-of-the-art technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyphenation support,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup footnotes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution and scalable vector graphics,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ereader-compatible tables of contents,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean it has to use old technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quality covers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;An ebookshelf featuring Standard Ebooks covers.&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/covers.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clean code &amp;amp; semantic markup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A screenshot of the source code of a Standard Ebook file.&quot; src=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/images/code.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;10.40523465704&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15.85559566787&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; believed to be in the public domain in the US, Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre&quot;&gt;libre&lt;/a&gt; too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; Yeah, I basically volunteered myself to maintain it quite some time
&amp;gt; ago back when I fixed the concurrency issues which exhibited itself
&amp;gt; only with VM-emulated devices, and at the same time I still had the
&amp;gt; physical 3.5&quot; reader.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The hardware doesn't work any more though. So I guess I should just
&amp;gt; remove myself as a maintainer to reflect the reality and mark floppy.c
&amp;gt; as Orphaned.
&lt;/span&gt;
Well, without jokes about Thunderdome, I've got time, hardware and
would like to maintain the floppy. Except the for recent fixes,
I described floppy ioctls in syzkaller. I've already spent quite
a lot of time with this code. Thus, if nobody minds

Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: floppy: take over maintainership

I would like to maintain the floppy driver. After the recent fixes,
I think I know the code pretty well. Nowadays I've got 2 physical 3.5&quot;
readers to test all the changes.

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Fasting is one of the biggest weight-loss trends to arise in recent years. Endorsed by A-list celebrities and the subject of a spate of best-selling books, it was the eighth most-Googled diet in America in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But fasting shouldn’t be dismissed as just another fad. At the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, I’ve employed what’s called intermittent fasting, or time-restricted eating, to help patients with an array of chronic conditions. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, rheumatism and bowel diseases, as well as pain syndromes such as migraines and osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are different ways to go about it, but I advise patients to omit either dinner or breakfast, so that they don’t ingest any food for at least 14 hours at a stretch. That makes lunch the most important meal of the day. It also reduces the time spent each day processing food and lengthens the period devoted to cleansing and restoring the body’s cells, both of which have positive health effects. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Adopting this technique is not as difficult as it may seem. If you sleep from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., you’ve already fasted for eight hours. Now you only need another six. It’s healthy to avoid eating late in the evening to let your body burn energy from food rather than store it, so if you eat dinner by 7 p.m., that’s another four hours. For breakfast, you can limit yourself to coffee or tea (maybe with a small piece of fruit) and make lunch your first proper meal. By that time, you’re clearly beyond the 14 hours and don’t need to restrain yourself: You can eat until you are full. &lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetPullQuote&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetPullQuote&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;wsj-article-pullquote article__inset__pullquote &quot;&gt;
    
    
      &lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-content article__inset__pullquote__quote&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;l-qt article__inset__pullquote__mark--left&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;
        Scientific evidence for the glory of breakfast is scarce. Instead, we should skip it and eat lunch like kings. 
        &lt;span class=&quot;r-qt article__inset__pullquote__mark--right&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;The biologist Satchidananda Panda at California’s Salk Institute showed the possibilities of this approach in a 2012 report in the journal Cell Metabolism. He fed a group of mice a high-fat diet around the clock for 18 weeks; they developed fatty livers, pancreatic disease and diabetes. Another group was fed the exact same number of calories a day, but all during an eight-hour span. Surprisingly, the second group stayed slimmer and healthier for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;There is a logic to it. When we eat, our body releases insulin. That disrupts the process of autophagy (from the Greek, meaning “self-devouring”), by which cells deconstruct old, damaged components in order to release energy and build new molecules. Autophagy helps to counteract the aging of cells and builds immunity. Fasts stimulate autophagy and allow the full molecular process to take place, as a team led by Frank Madeo at the University of Graz in Austria found in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;Fasting also can contribute to brain health and happiness. The neurobiologist Mark Mattson, who retired this year from the National Institutes of Health, has demonstrated in experiments for two decades that nerve growth factors contribute significantly to brain health and positive mood. He also found that fasting, restricting calories and exercising spur distinct increases in the best-known nerve growth factor, BDNF. &lt;/p&gt;




      






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;More essays&lt;/h4&gt;
       
       &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Test animals in Dr. Mattson’s laboratory that fasted intermittently even showed a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s, though those results would have to be clearly confirmed in large human studies to reach any firm conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;All of this presents a question: If we should generally eat only two meals a day, which meal is it best to skip? Many of us have heard the saying: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper like a pauper.” Scientific evidence for the glory of breakfast is scarce, however, and realistically, it’s easier to sustain skipping breakfast than skipping dinner. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Instead of breakfast, we should eat lunch like kings. A rich lunch beats a robust dinner. A U.K.-led study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2016 showed that among 69 women, those who consumed most of their calories at lunch shed 3.3 pounds more in 12 weeks than those who ate a bigger dinner. After all, it’s around lunchtime that the body requires the greatest amount of energy for keeping its body temperature up. Less energy thus passes into our fat reserves. &lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetPullQuote&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetPullQuote&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;wsj-article-pullquote article__inset__pullquote &quot;&gt;
    
    
      &lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-content article__inset__pullquote__quote&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;l-qt article__inset__pullquote__mark--left&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;
        Fasting overcomes an instinctive need in a way that gives us physical and mental strength.
        &lt;span class=&quot;r-qt article__inset__pullquote__mark--right&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Researchers are increasingly probing the optimal timing of meals, duration of fasting and the various potential health effects. Scientists at the University of Padua have found, for instance, that young, healthy athletes fasting for 16 hours benefited from metabolic changes over eight weeks compared with their peers. The regimen lowered the levels of inflammatory factors in their blood and factors accelerating the aging process, including insulin.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Fasting might even be effective in preventing the recurrence of cancer, as suggested by initial results of an epidemiological study conducted by researchers at the University of California at San Diego, published in 2016 in the journal JAMA Oncology. Among 2,400 women with early-stage breast cancer who provided information on their eating rhythm, roughly 400 suffered from new tumors within seven years. But women who fasted for 13 hours nightly had 26% less risk of recurrence than the control group. One possible reason was suggested in data summarized last year from a decade of animal experiments by Valter Longo and a team at the University of Southern California: Cancer cells are less able than normal cells to survive a lack of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;As a practice, fasting is more than simply restricting calories or nutrients. For many people, it is also a spiritual experience. Over the course of our lives, we encounter many kinds of deficiency, whether of money, success or affection. Fasting is a conscious renunciation, a controlled exercise in deprivation. That’s why successful fasting increases self-efficacy—we overcome an instinctive need in a way that gives us physical and mental strength. In his novel “Siddhartha,” Hermann Hesse describes this wonderfully: “Nothing is performed by demons; there are no demons. Anyone can perform magic. Anyone can reach his goals if he can think, if he can wait, if he can fast.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p class=&quot;articleTagLine&quot;&gt;—Dr. Michalsen is a professor at Berlin’s Charité University Medical Center. This essay is adapted from his new book, “The Nature Cure: A Doctor’s Guide to the Science of Natural Medicine,” which Viking will publish on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to geezer town, junior.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching my recent article, “&lt;a title=&quot;Article on Age Discrimination by yours truly&quot; href=&quot;https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/04/20/age-discrimination-and-programming-jobs/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Age discrimination and Programming Jobs&lt;/a&gt;” , I discovered a &lt;a title=&quot;NYT Article: &amp;quot;Now Hiring, if you're young.&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/opinion/now-hiring-if-you-re-young.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1998 Op-Ed piece from The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that cited some startling statistics from the NSF and Census bureau about the longevity of a software engineering career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[S]ix years after finishing college, 57 percent of computer science graduates are working as programmers; at 15 years the figure drops to 34 percent, and at 20 years — when most are still only in their early 40’s — it is down to 19 percent. In contrast, the figures for civil engineering are 61 percent, 52 percent and 52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

In a lot of ways, the Government has been very slow to grok the software engineering trade. In this study it completely ignores the significant number of working programmers who either earned their degree in another discipline or never finished college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Still, smart money seems to concur that the software engineer depreciates only slightly more slowly than the machine he or she toils behind as exemplified in this 1996 comment from &lt;a title=&quot;Craig Barrett Bio&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Barrett_(businessman)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Craig Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, then President and Co-founder of Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The half-life of an engineer, software or hardware, is only a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the guy’s a suit, but more importantly he was (at the time) a 57 year old former engineer publicly reinforcing the discriminatory notion of expiration dates on other engineers. It’s scary as hell to think that such an influential industry insider thinks that a programming career is roughly the same as a professional basketball player’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My take on the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable accusatory ink has been dedicated to the age discrimination problem in technology, but I suspect it may be an inevitable consequence of the rapid pace of change that defines this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The market value of an employee is primarily determined by experience in technologies relevant to the employer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software engineering reliably undergoes a major technology shift at least every 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While a technology shift doesn’t completely negate the skills of veterans, it certainly levels the playing field for recent grads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now put yourself in the shoes of a prospective hiring manager using a newer technology like Ruby on Rails for which nobody other than &lt;a title=&quot;Creator of Rails&quot; href=&quot;http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Heinemeier&lt;/a&gt;has more than about 5 years of experience.  Sure, that extra 10 years of C++ experience is a positive differentiator for the veteran over the upstart with the same 3 years of Rails experience.  All things equal you’d naturally hire the guy with more total experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all things are NOT equal. Those 10 years of C++ experience made the veteran candidate progressively more expensive as they leveraged the value of that experience in jobs requiring C++. The problem is that the marginal utility of that extra experience must exceed the marginal cost of hiring the veteran to justify paying the premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein is the source of the problem. The more irrelevant experience a candidate has, the more lopsided the utility/value equation becomes, and this presumes that the manager even has the luxury of paying extra to get that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the veteran prices himself competitively with a younger candidate, the hiring manager has to consider the implications of bringing in someone taking a big pay cut. Will they have morale issues from day one? Are they going to change their mind after a month that they really do need that extra cash and leave? It’s a sticky situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that unlike other forms of discrimination that are more arbitrary and capricious, age discrimination can often be a result of objective and sound business justifications. I’m not trying to justify it as an acceptable practice, but just trying to describe the pickle it puts the manager in trying to make a sound business decision without compromising the ethical and legal obligations of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what’s your plan B?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you aren’t fabulously wealthy, accepted to clown college, or the fatal victim of a Red-bull induced heart attack by 40 a mitigation strategy is in order. Here are some viable options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;678&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/chooseadventure/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;190,310&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;chooseadventure&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Choose Your Adventure Book Cover- The Cave of Time&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg?w=184&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg?w=190&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-678&quot; title=&quot;chooseadventure&quot; src=&quot;https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg?w=468&quot; alt=&quot;chooseadventure&quot; srcset=&quot;https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg 190w, https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg?w=92 92w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work for the one person who would never discriminate against you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Not your mother. You! If you aren’t the entrepreneurial type, consider a consultancy. For some reason that I don’t completely get, a little gray hair and a smattering of experience in different technologies can create a beneficial bias for companies when they are renting brains instead of buying them outright. It may have something to do with the tendency for consultants to be vetted from higher up in the management chain where the silver foxes live.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Give in to the dark side and go into management.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that a career in programming does precious little to prepare someone for management, but clearly management thinks that everyone including technologists harbors a deep longing to “graduate” into their ranks. I think it a fallacy that no one would continue to design and build software for 20 years unless they had no ambition or growth potential. However, people like me that respect such dedication to the craft are in the minority. Maybe it is best to just stop fighting it, but consider the following before taking the plunge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mid-level managers often make very little more, if not the same as high level engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets progressively harder to keep up with new technology because you don’t work directly with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings, politics and dealing with unrealistic requests will pretty much become your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may try to avoid it, but management-speak will creep into your vocabulary (did you notice my “paradigm” comment earlier?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when it isn’t your fault, it’s your fault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when you make it succeed, your team should get the credit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being the wunderkind as a technologist is much easier to do in technology than management, you’ll have to check your ego at the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be forced to make decisions that affect people’s personal life (pay, bonus, firing, etc.) and this is hard to stomach sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very empowering, enjoyable to be able to set the agenda and sometimes say, “No. We ain’t doing that shit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers are predictable, people are complicated. You will eventually fantasize about robot employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentoring can be very rewarding, but also very challenging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch someone else do it wrong without comment.&lt;br /&gt;-Theodore H. White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got a cash cow, milk that sucker!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you love programming because you like technology, so this may go against your very nature, but no one says you’ve got to jump every time some snot-nosed kid invents a new way to run byte-code. You have invested a lot of time and energy mastering the technology you use, and your experience differentiates you. Money follows scarcity, and snow-birding on an older technology, if you can stomach it, may just be the way to protect your earning potential. The industry turns on a dime, but is slow to retire proven technology. It is highly likely that you will still be able to earn some decent coin in the technology you know and love even after a few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Contributing to the Mozilla code base</title>
<link>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;This page should guide you through the initial steps of contributing to Mozilla. Welcome, we're delighted to see you! :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;21.30375&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Need_help&quot;&gt;Need help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla community prides itself on being an open, accessible, and friendly community for new participants. If you have any difficulties getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please bring those questions to the &lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://chat.mibbit.com/?url=irc%3A%2F%2Firc.mozilla.org%2F%23introduction&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;#introduction chat room on irc.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;, where we can help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know even before you start contributing that getting set up to work on Firefox and finding a bug that's a good fit for your skills can be a challenge. We're always looking for ways to improve this process: making Mozilla more open, accessible, and easier to participate with. If you're having any trouble following this documentation, or hit a barrier you can't get around, please contact Mike Hoye at &lt;a class=&quot;link-mailto&quot; href=&quot;mailto:mhoye@mozilla.com&quot; rel=&quot;freelink&quot;&gt;mhoye@mozilla.com&lt;/a&gt;. We're determined to solve hurdles for new contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;What_skills_do_I_need&quot;&gt;What skills do I need?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is a large project and we are thrilled to have contributors with very diverse skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;C++,&lt;/strong&gt; you can contribute to the core layers of Firefox and other Mozilla products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;HTML/CSS&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to the front-end of Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to Firefox on Android, &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firefox Focus for Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-tv&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firefox for Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firefox Preview&lt;/a&gt; (code name: &quot;Fenix&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firefox for iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firefox Focus for iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to our web services, including Firefox Sync, or Firefox Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Make&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;shell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Perl&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to our build systems, release engineering, and automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to NSS, Opus, and Daala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;, you can contribute to the Rust programming language; &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://servo.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/a&gt;, the web browser engine designed for parallelism and safety; or Quantum, the project to bring large pieces of Servo to Gecko&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are even many ways to contribute to the Mozilla mission without programming. If getting involved in design, support, translation, testing, or other types of contributions sparks your interest please see the &lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/contribute/areas.html&quot;&gt;Volunteer Opportunities wiki&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://activate.mozilla.community/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Activate community&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you do not know programming yet, but you want to start learning? There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn&quot; title=&quot;/en-US/learn&quot;&gt;plenty of resources&lt;/a&gt; available on the MDN Web Docs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_1_Build_Firefox_for_Desktop_or_Mobile&quot;&gt;Step 1: Build Firefox for Desktop or Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to contribute to Firefox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build&quot; title=&quot;Simple Firefox Build&quot;&gt;simple instructions to build desktop or mobile Firefox are here&lt;/a&gt;. Getting set up may take some time as there are some big downloads involved, so you may want to move on to the next steps while it builds. Additional build instructions can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions&quot; title=&quot;Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's other products, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Thunderbird_build&quot; title=&quot;Simple Thunderbird build&quot;&gt;community-supported Thunderbird builds&lt;/a&gt;, can be found with a quick search. Often you won't need to build anything to start making a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_2_Find_something_to_work_on&quot;&gt;Step 2: Find something to work on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugs listed as 'Assigned' are not usually a good place to start, unless you're sure you have something worthy to contribute. Someone else is already working on it!&lt;br/&gt;Even with no assignee, it is polite to check if someone has recently commented that they're looking at fixing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have found something to work on, go ahead and comment! Let the bug submitter, reviewer, and component owner know that you'd like to work on the bug. You might receive some extra information, perhaps also made the assignee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Fix_your_pet_peeve&quot;&gt;Fix your pet peeve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's something you'd like to fix about Firefox, Thunderbird, or your other favorite Mozilla application, this can be a great place to start. There are a number of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Find_a_bug_we've_identified_as_a_good_fit_for_new_contributors.&quot;&gt;Find a bug we've identified as a good fit for new contributors.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than a million bugs filed in Bugzilla, it can be hard to know where to start, so we've created these bug categories to make getting involved a little easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://codetribute.mozilla.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Codetribute&lt;/a&gt; - our site for finding bugs that are mentored, some are good first bugs, some are slightly harder. Your mentor will help guide you with the bug fix and through the submission and landing process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzil.la/sw:%22[good%20first%20bug]%22&amp;amp;limit=0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://bugzil.la/sw:&amp;quot;[good first bug]&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Good First Bugs&lt;/a&gt; - are the best way to take your first steps into the Mozilla ecosystem. They're all about small changes, sometimes as little as a few lines, but they're a great way to learn about setting up your development environment, navigating Bugzilla, and making contributions to the Mozilla codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/startmozilla&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@StartMozilla on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - we link up Good First Bugs for new contributors across Mozilla every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://firefox-dev.tools&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;firefox-dev.tools&lt;/a&gt; - we list Firefox Developer Tools bugs for new contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzil.la/kw:student-project&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://bugzil.la/kw:student-project&quot;&gt;Student Projects&lt;/a&gt; - are larger projects, such as might be suitable for a university student for credit. Of course, if you are not a student, feel free to fix one of these bugs. We maintain two lists: one for projects &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzil.la/kw:student-project&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://bugzil.la/kw:student-project&quot;&gt;based on the existing codebase&lt;/a&gt;, and one for &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Yoric/Mozilla-Student-Projects/issues&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://github.com/Yoric/Mozilla-Student-Projects/issues&quot;&gt;implementing new applications.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Use_a_bug_searching_tool&quot;&gt;Use a bug searching tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tools developed by members of the Mozilla community. These help&lt;br/&gt;new contributors find bugs to work on, without having to use Bugzilla's more perplexing search component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_3_Fix_the_bug&quot;&gt;Step 3: Fix the bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leave this in your hands. Here are some further resources to help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_4_Get_your_code_reviewed&quot;&gt;Step 4: Get your code reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you fix the bug, you can advance to having your code reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla uses Phabricator for code review. Either use &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mozilla's Phabricator instance&lt;/a&gt; (preferred) or attach a patch as an attachment to Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the right person to ask for a review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a mentored bug: ask your mentor. They will help, or can easily find out. It might be them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;hg blame&lt;/code&gt; on the file and look for the people who have touched the functions you're working on. They too are good candidates.&lt;br/&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;hg log&lt;/code&gt; and looking for regular reviewers might be a solution too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bug itself may contain a clear indication of the best person to ask for a review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there related bugs on similar topics? The reviewer in those bugs might be another good choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have an out of date &lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;list of modules&lt;/a&gt;, which lists peers and owners for the module. Some of these will be good reviewers. In a worst case scenario, set the module owner as the reviewer, asking them in the comments to pick someone more suitable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please select only one reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Step_4b_Follow_it_up&quot;&gt;Step 4b: Follow it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've asked for a review, a reviewer will often respond within a day or two, reviewing the patch, or saying when they will be able to review it, perhaps due to a backlog. If you don't hear back within this time, naturally reach out to them: add a comment to the bug saying 'review ping?', check the &quot;Need more information from&quot; box, and add the reviewer's name. If they don't respond within a day or two, you can ask for help on IRC in the &lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://chat.mibbit.com/?url=irc%3A%2F%2Firc.mozilla.org%2F%23introduction&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;#introduction&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&quot;external link-https&quot; href=&quot;https://chat.mibbit.com/?url=irc%3A%2F%2Firc.mozilla.org%2F%23developers&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;#developers&lt;/a&gt; channels, or contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mhoye@mozilla.com?subject=Code%20Review%20Request%20&amp;amp;body=URL%3A%20%20%5Bplease%20paste%20a%20link%20to%20your%20patch%20here.%5D&quot;&gt;Mike Hoye&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to contact your mentor as well if this isn't moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_5_Respond_to_the_review&quot;&gt;Step 5: Respond to the review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most new contributors, and even for long-time Mozillians, the first review of your patch will be &quot;Requested Changes&quot; (or an &quot;r-&quot; in Bugzilla). This does not mean you've done bad work. There is more work to do before the code can be merged into the tree. Your patch may need some changes - perhaps minor, perhaps major - and your reviewer will give you some guidance on what needs to be done next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important process, so don't be discouraged! With our long-lived codebase, and hundreds of millions of users, the care and attention helping contributors bring good patches is the cornerstone of the Mozilla project. Make any changes your reviewer seeks; if you're unsure how, be sure to ask! Attach the new patch to the bug again, and ask for a further review from the same reviewer. If they accept your changes, this means your patch can be landed into the tree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_6_Getting_code_into_the_tree&quot;&gt;Step 6: Getting code into the tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your patch has been accepted, it is ready to go. Before it can be merged into the tree, your patch will need to complete a successful run through our &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/TryServer&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;try server&lt;/a&gt;, making sure there are no unexpected regressions. If you don't have try server access already, your mentor, or the person who reviewed your patch, will be able to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt; try server run, mark that your patch is ready to commit, by adding the &lt;em&gt;checkin-needed&lt;/em&gt; keyword, to the &quot;keywords&quot; field at the top of the bug. A friendly Mozillian, with commit access, will be along shortly to push your patch to the repository, and update the bug as required. If your patch passes all Mozilla's automated testing, it will soon be merged into the main branch, and become a part of the Nightly build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Step_7_Repeat&quot;&gt;Step 7: Repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you! You've fixed your very first bug, and the Open Web is stronger for it. But don't stop now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to step 3, as there is plenty more to do. Your mentor might suggest a new bug for you to work on, or &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;find one that interests you&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that you've got your first bug fixed you should request level 1 access to the repository to push to the try server and get automated feedback about your changes on multiple platforms. After fixing a nontrivial number of bugs you should request level 3 access so you can land your own code after it has been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;More_information&quot;&gt;More information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of improving information on this page for newcomers to the project. We'll be integrating some information from these pages soon, but until then you may find them interesting in their current form:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Secretly Public Domain: Most books published in the US before 1964</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;*&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot; src=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/nb/themes/Default/entry.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0#comments&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; title=&quot;10 comments&quot; alt=&quot;[Comments]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/nb//themes/Default/comments.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10) &lt;a name=&quot;2019-7-22-0&quot; class=&quot;entryDate&quot;&gt;Mon Jul 22 2019 08:39&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;entryTitle&quot;&gt;Secretly Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;&quot;Fun facts&quot; are, sadly, often less than fun. But here's a genuinely fun fact: most books published in the US before 1964 are in the public domain! Back then, you had to send in a form to get a second 28-year copyright term, and most people didn't bother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;This is how Project Gutenberg is able to publish &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/24817&quot;&gt;all these science fiction stories from the 50s and 60s&lt;/a&gt;. Those stories were published in issues of magazines that didn't send in the renewal form. But up til now this hasn't been a big factor, because 1) the big publishers generally made sure to send in their renewals, and 2) it's been impossible to check renewal status in bulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;Up through the 1970s, the Library of Congress published a huge series of books listing all the registrations and the renewals. All these tomes have been scanned -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Library+of+Congress.+Copyright+Office.%22&quot;&gt;Internet Archive has the registration books&lt;/a&gt;—but only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exhibits.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals&quot;&gt;renewal information&lt;/a&gt; was machine-readable. Checking renewal status for a given book was a tedious job, involving flipping back and forth between a bunch of books in a federal depository library or, more recently, a bunch of browser tabs. Checking the status for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; books was impossible, because the list of registrations was not machine-readable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;But! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964&quot;&gt;A recent NYPL project&lt;/a&gt; has paid for the already-digitized registration records to be marked up as XML. (I was not involved, BTW, apart from saying &quot;yes, this would work&quot; four years ago.) Now for anything that's unambiguously a &quot;book&quot;, we have a parseable record of its pre-1964 interactions with the Copyright Office: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NYPL/catalog_of_copyright_entries_project&quot;&gt;the initial registration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NYPL/cce-renewals/&quot;&gt;any potential renewal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;The two datasets are in different formats, but a little elbow grease will mesh them up. It turns out that eighty percent of 1924-1963 books never had their copyright renewed. More importantly, with a couple caveats about foreign publication and such, &lt;em&gt;we now know which 80%&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entryText&quot;&gt;This was announced back in May, but I don't think it got the attention it deserved. This is a really big deal, so I had no choice but to create a bot. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://botsin.space/@SecretlyPublicDomain&quot;&gt;Secretly Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;, which highlights unrenewed works that have already been scanned for &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006188134&quot;&gt;Hathi Trust&lt;/a&gt;. This only represents 10% of the 80%, but it's the ten percent most likely to be interesting, and these books have the easiest path towards being available online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh, I'm currently in Germany so I can't access Gutenberg at all! But it's a temporary state so I'll bookmark the page in order to check when I'm back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it take to apply the same method to music recordings (shellac records)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;12.188217291507&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catalog of Copyright Entries has volumes for things other than &quot;books proper&quot;. Here are four volumes for music from 1955, two of which might be duplicates: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395li/&quot;&gt;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395li/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395libr/&quot;&gt;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395libr/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395lib/&quot;&gt;https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig395lib/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/CatalogOfCopyrightEntriesSeries3Vol.9Part5cNos.1-2jan.-dec.1955/&quot;&gt;https://archive.org/details/CatalogOfCopyrightEntriesSeries3Vol.9Part5cNos.1-2jan.-dec.1955/&lt;/a&gt;Up to this point almost all the attention has been on &quot;books proper&quot;. I don't think any of the other data has been made machine-readable, except as a side effect of work on &quot;books proper&quot;. The other complication is that -- I'm sure you know about this more than I do -- there's no federal copyright protection for sound recordings until 1972, so sound recordings generally don't have CCE entries.I asked around and this is what I heard (but I can't confirm): NYPL has money for making the entire CCE machine-readable -- registrations and renewals for everything. However, there's no timeframe for making this happen. On top of that, I don't know if this information would be useful in clearing sound recordings, because I don't know what that process looks like. If it's important to establish that the underlying &lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt; is in the public domain, then machine-readable CCE data would help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool...but I found several of those 'public domain gems' at Secretly Public Domain, when checking for access to them at Hathi Trust they are still listed there as under copyright and thus are locked down against any downloads, except for individual pages. Will Hathi be updating their rights status/accessibility any time soon? Thx!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clarification--NYPL does not yet have the resources in hand to convert the non-books records. Outside of our project, some of the other CCE data has been transcribed. We'd like to do the entire CCE, so we're actively fundraising for those efforts.At this point, about 70% of the 450,000 pages that make up the CCE are left to review and convert. We have a lot of work to do to extract the rest of the data, but Leonard's work demonstrates the value of our transcription and parsing.As we get more transcription done, we'll keep adding it to the GitHub repo. We'd appreciate knowing how the data is being used, but there's no limitation or restriction on your use of the data.On the sound recordings, Leonard has it exactly right. Until this year, sound recordings fixed before 1972 would be protected by state law. Many states had indefinite terms for copyright protection, so those would have remained in copyright until 2067. With the new music bill, that changes. Sound recordings published before 1923 will now enter the public domain in 2023. Recordings published after 1923 will follow a series of tiers that will result in more works entering the public domain on an accelerated timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;16.486136783734&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, nearly all music recordings aren't public domain yet. Until recently, they were effectively under perpetual copyright, but thanks to recent changes in copyright law, they'll start entering the public domain in 2022. See this Library of Congress post for more details:&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2019/02/copyright-breakdown-the-music-modernization-act/&quot;&gt;https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2019/02/copyright-breakdown-the-music-modernization-act/&lt;/a&gt;As noted above, to be fully in the public domain, the copyright to the musical composition will need to have expired, as well as the copyright to the recording. It gets a little complicated.Likewise, there are complications and various traps for the unwary with book copyrights as well. It isn't enough to simply fail to find a renewal; you also need to check things like whether material in the book was previously published somewhere that might still have an active copyright, whether the book is a foreign work that's exempt from renewal requirements, and various other things. The book _Finding the Public Domain_ by Levine et al. discusses the clearance process in more detail (and it's free to read online).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Greg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;12.58064516129&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this data, NYPL has convinced Hathi to remove the restrictions on a number of titles. An example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008300397&amp;amp;view=1up&amp;amp;seq=7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Americans in Santo Domingo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1928. But Hathi have their own verification process, and that's where we go back from fast computer work (&quot;these items in dataset A have no matching item in dataset B&quot;) to one-at-a-time lawyer work.As John points out, the absence of a renewal record isn't enough on its own to know that a work is public domain. In particular, Hathi declined to open up some of the titles we pointed out because they included third-party works. Hathi would have to know whether those third-party works were included with authorization, which is almost impossible to determine 80 years later. (This was one of the arguments for keeping &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; under copyright -- it ended up not working in that case.) And you can't tell whether this &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a problem without going through a copy of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I missing?If a book was published 1923 to 1964 and is NOT in the renewed list, then it is not in copyright. Yes?I'm missing the need to consult the original registration, unless you suspect renewals don't accurately represent the original publication. Yes?Sorry. It sounds like an extremely excellent data set and project and would like to help. Thanks! Patrick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;commentBody&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick, you're right. If a book was published in the US between 1924 and 1964, but not renewed, it is (with the aforementioned caveats) not in copyright. If you're thinking of one particular book, it's very easy to find the answer. All you need is the renewal records. No need to check the original registration. Project Gutenberg has been doing this for a while.So, why weren't we able, up to this point, to make a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; list of unrenewed books?Basically, there was no starting point. Nobody had a complete list of all the books published in the US between 1924 and 1964. The registration records only list the books that &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; public domain. It's like having a list of the people who moved out of a city. You can easily check if any particular person has left, but you can't make a list of everyone who still lives there. You have to start with a list of everyone who &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to live there, and subtract the people who left.We probably never will have a complete list of books published in the US between 1924 and 1964, but there's a pretty good substitute: the list of books registered with the Copyright Office for that time period. That's the list that NYPL just converted into machine-readable format. Now we can get something like a complete list of unrenewed books by subtracting the renewal records from the registration records.As a bonus, each renewal record has a semi-unique ID linking it to the original registration -- something you wouldn't get if you built your own list of &quot;all of the books&quot; from a library catalog or something. This makes it easy to understand cases where a book was published multiple times by different publishers. It's not 100% reliable -- some IDs were reused for reasons we don't understand -- but it's more reliable than going for a title or author match. And data from the Copyright Office is pretty definitive. It's hard to claim that a book wasn't &quot;really&quot; published in the US if there's a copyright registration for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

<title>Living Near Trees, Not Just Green Space, Improves Wellbeing</title>
<link>https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/07/urban-tree-canopy-green-space-wellbeing-research/595060/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/07/urban-tree-canopy-green-space-wellbeing-research/595060/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, study after study has found that living in neighborhoods with abundant green space is linked to positive health outcomes. These include better &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/environment/being-in-nature-makes-your-heart-healthier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, stronger &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/social-justice/green-spaces-linked-to-kids-cognitive-development&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive development&lt;/a&gt;, and greater &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/news/green-environments-linked-to-longer-lives&quot;&gt;overall longevity&lt;/a&gt;. No wonder these areas are also linked to lower &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/environment/new-research-links-green-spaces-to-lower-medicare-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;levels of Medicare spending&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it come to promoting human health, not all green spaces are created equal. That’s the conclusion of new Australian research, which finds higher levels of wellness in areas marked by one particular manifestation of the natural world: leafy trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protection and restoration of urban tree canopy specifically, rather than any urban greening, may be a good option for promotion of community mental health,” write Thomas Astell-Burt and Xiaoqi Feng of the University of Wollongong in New South Wales. Their study, along with a commentary, is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They describe a large-scale longitudinal study featuring 46,786 mostly older residents of three Australian urban areas. The subjects were initially interviewed between 2006 and 2009; follow-up reports were taken between 2012 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At both points, participants were asked to rate their overall health, and noted whether they have ever been diagnosed with, or treated for, anxiety or depression. In addition, they completed a 10-item questionnaire designed to measure their risk of psychological distress. Among other items, they noted how often in recent weeks they had felt “hopeless, rigid, or fidgety,” “so sad that nothing could cheer you up,” or “worthless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared the participants’ answers to the natural features of the “mesh block” where their home is located (a geographical unit containing 30 to 60 dwellings). Using satellite imagery, the team calculated both the percentage of total green space and “separate green space types, including tree canopy, grass, or other low-lying vegetation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking into account such variables as the participants’ age, gender, education, and household income, the researchers were able to confirm the results of previous studies, finding that “total green space appeared to be associated with lower odds of incident psychological distress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;More intriguingly, they also found that exposure to low-lying vegetation was not consistently associated with any particular health outcome. Exposure to grass was, surprisingly, associated with higher odds of psychological distress. The wellness-boosting feature, then, appears to be the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers report that living in areas where 30 percent or more of the outdoor space is dominated by tree canopy was associated with 31 percent lower odds of psychological distress, compared to people living in areas with 0 to 9 percent tree canopy. “Similar results were found for self-related fair to poor general health,” with tree-rich residents reporting better health overall, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;label for=&quot;promo-email-input-email&quot; class=&quot;c-newsletter__cta c-newsletter__cta--promo&quot;&gt;The best way to follow issues you care about.&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astell-Burt and Feng can only speculate on the reasons behind their findings, but they come up with some reasonable guesses. “Shorn of tree canopy, sidewalk temperatures can be higher, sidewalks can seem noisier, and walkers along them are exposed to more air pollution,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, they point to &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that “higher levels of biodiversity, rather than the amount of green space, were associated with more favorable levels of psychological well-being.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12943&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that “tree canopy is more supportive of biodiversity than open grasslands,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying commentary, Dutch environmental researcher Sjerp de Vries cautions that these researchers are journeying into “uncharted territory,” and suggests that a measure of per capita green space might be the best measure of its benefits. Additional research is clearly called for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these results provide evidence of the benefits of natural shade, and suggest that our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/richard-powers-pulitzer-the-overstory/587245/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;love of trees&lt;/a&gt; may be biologically driven. A neighborhood’s leafiness is worth keeping in mind when you’re deciding where to put down roots.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple suspends Siri response grading in response to privacy concerns</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/apple-suspends-siri-response-grading-in-response-to-privacy-concerns/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/apple-suspends-siri-response-grading-in-response-to-privacy-concerns/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In response to concerns raised by a Guardian&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;story last week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;over how recordings of Siri queries are used for quality control, Apple is suspending the program world wide. Apple says it will review the process that it uses, called grading, to determine whether Siri is hearing queries correctly, or being invoked by mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, it will be issuing a software update in the future that will let Siri users choose whether they participate in the grading process or not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Guardian story from Alex Hern quoted extensively from a contractor at a firm hired by Apple to perform part of a Siri quality control process it calls grading. This takes snippets of audio, which are not connected to names or IDs of individuals, and has contractors listen to them to judge whether Siri is accurately hearing them — and whether Siri may have been invoked by mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy,” Apple said in a statement to TechCrunch. “While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contractor claimed that the audio snippets could contain personal information, audio of people having sex and other details like finances that could be identifiable, regardless of the process Apple uses to anonymize the records. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also questioned how clear it was to users that their raw audio snippets may be sent to contractors to evaluate in order to help make Siri work better. When this story broke, I dipped into Apple’s terms of service myself and, though there are mentions of quality control for Siri and data being shared, I found that it did fall short of explicitly and plainly making it clear that live recordings, even short ones, are used in the process and may be transmitted and listened to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The figures Apple has cited put the amount of queries that may be selected for grading under 1% of daily requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The process of taking a snippet of audio a few seconds long and sending it to either internal personnel or contractors to evaluate is, essentially, industry standard. Audio recordings of requests made to Amazon and Google assistants are also reviewed by humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An explicit way for users to agree to the audio being used this way is table stakes in this kind of business. I’m glad Apple says it will be adding one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also aligns better with the way that Apple handles other data, like app performance data that can be used by developers to identify and fix bugs in their software. Currently, when you set up your iPhone, you must give Apple permission to transmit that data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has embarked on a long campaign of positioning itself as the most privacy conscious of the major mobile firms, and therefore holds a heavier burden when it comes to standards. Doing as much as the other major companies do when it comes to things like using user data for quality control and service improvements cannot be enough if it wants to maintain the stance and the market edge that it brings along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Knuth on Huang&amp;#039;s Sensitivity Proof: “I&amp;#039;ve got the proof down to one page” [pdf]</title>
<link>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1815290</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1815290</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Sensitivity Conjecture, which I blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=453&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, says that, for every Boolean function f:{0,1}&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→{0,1}, the &lt;em&gt;sensitivity&lt;/em&gt; of f—that is, the maximum, over all 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; input strings x∈{0,1}&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, of the number of input bits such that flipping them changes the value of f—is at most polynomially smaller than a bunch of other complexity measures of f, including f’s block sensitivity, degree as a real polynomial, and classical and quantum query complexities. (For more, see for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rocco/Teaching/S12/Readings/BdW.pdf&quot;&gt;this survey&lt;/a&gt; by Buhrman and de Wolf. Or for quick definitions of the relevant concepts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19902/boolean-functions-where-sensitivity-equals-block-sensitivity&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since it was posed by Nisan and Szegedy in 1989, this conjecture has stood as one of the most frustrating and embarrassing open problems in all of combinatorics and theoretical computer science. It seemed so easy, and so similar to other statements that had 5-line proofs. But a lot of the best people in the field sank months into trying to prove it. For whatever it’s worth, I also sank … well, at least weeks into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/&quot;&gt;Hao Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at Emory University, has posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf&quot;&gt;6-page preprint&lt;/a&gt; on his homepage that finally proves the Sensitivity Conjecture, in the form s(f)≥√deg(f). (I thank Ryan O’Donnell for tipping me off to this.) Within the preprint, the proof itself is about a page and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever there’s an announcement like this, ~99% of the time either the proof is wrong, or at any rate it’s way too complicated for outsiders to evaluate it quickly. This is one of the remaining 1% of cases. I’m rather confident that the proof is right. Why? Because I read and understood it. It took me about half an hour. If you’re comfortable with concepts like &lt;em&gt;induced subgraph&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;eigenvalue&lt;/em&gt;, you can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From pioneering work by Gotsman and Linial in 1992, it was known that to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture, it suffices to prove the following even simpler combinatorial conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let S be any subset of the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube, {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, which has size 2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+1. Then there must be a point in S with at least ~n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; neighbors in S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here c&amp;gt;0 is some constant (say 1/2), and two points in S are “neighbors” if and only they differ in a single coordinate. Note that if S had size 2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;, then the above statement would be false—as witnessed, for example, by the set of all n-bit strings with an even number of 1’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang proceeds by proving the Gotsman-Linial Conjecture. And the way he proves Gotsman-Linial is … well, at this point maybe I should just let you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf&quot;&gt;read the damn preprint&lt;/a&gt; yourself. I can’t say it more simply than he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to try anyway, I’d say: Huang constructs a 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; matrix, called A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, that has 0’s where there are no edges between the corresponding vertices of the Boolean hypercube, and either 1’s or -1’s where there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; edges—with a simple, weird pattern of 1’s and -1’s that magically makes everything work. He then lets H be an induced subgraph of the Boolean hypercube of size 2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+1. He lower-bounds the maximum degree of H by the largest eigenvalue of the corresponding (2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+1)×(2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+1) submatrix of A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, he lower-bounds that largest eigenvalue by … no, I don’t want to spoil it! Read it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Erdös famously spoke of a book, maintained by God, in which was written the simplest, most beautiful proof of each theorem. The highest compliment Erdös could give a proof was that it “came straight from the book.” In this case, I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the question is: how could such an elementary 1.5-page argument have been overlooked for 30 years? I don’t have a compelling answer to that, besides noting that “short” and “elementary” often have little to do with “obvious.” Once you start looking at the spectral properties of this matrix A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, the pieces snap together in precisely the right way—but how would you know to look at that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, earlier today I finished reading my first PG Wodehouse novel (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10554/10554-h/10554-h.htm&quot;&gt;Right Ho, Jeeves!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), on the gushing recommendation of a friend. I don’t know how I’d missed Wodehouse for 38 years. His defining talent is his ability to tie together five or six plot threads in a way that feels perfect and inevitable even though you didn’t see it coming. This produces a form of pleasure that’s nearly indistinguishable from the pleasure one feels in reading a “proof from the book.” So my pleasure centers are pretty overloaded today—but in such depressing times for the world, I’ll take pleasure wherever I can get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge congratulations to Hao!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added thought:&lt;/strong&gt; What this really is, is one of the purest illustrations I’ve seen in my career of the power and glory of the P≠NP phenomenon. We talk all the time about how proofs are easier to verify than to find. In practice, though, it can be far from obvious that that’s true. Consider your typical STOC/FOCS paper: writing it probably took the authors several months, while fully understanding the thing from scratch would probably take … &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; several months! If there’s a gap, it’s only by a factor of 4 or 5 or something. Whereas in this case, I don’t know how long Huang spent searching for the proof, but the combined search efforts of the community add up to years or decades. The ratio of the difficulty of finding to the difficulty of completely grasping is in the hundreds of thousands or millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another added thought:&lt;/strong&gt; Because Hao actually proves a stronger statement than the original Sensitivity Conjecture, it has additional implications, a few of which Hao mentions in his preprint. Here’s one he didn’t mention: any randomized algorithm to guess the parity of an n-bit string, which succeeds with probability at least 2/3 on the majority of strings, must make at least ~√n queries to the string, while any such quantum algorithm must make at least ~n&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt; queries. For more, see the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0036.pdf&quot;&gt;Weak Parity&lt;/a&gt; by me, Ambainis, Balodis, and Bavarian (Section 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Hao Huang himself has graciously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813116&quot;&gt;visited the comment section&lt;/a&gt; to satisfy readers’ curiosity by providing a detailed timeline of his work on the Sensitivity Conjecture. (tl;dr: he was introduced to the problem by Mike Saks in 2012, and had been attacking it on and off since then, until he finally had the key insight this past month while writing a grant proposal. Who knew that grant proposals could ever be useful for anything?!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Update:&lt;/strong&gt; In the comments section, my former student Shalev Ben-David points out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813084&quot;&gt;simplification&lt;/a&gt; of Huang’s argument, which no longer uses Cauchy’s interlacing theorem. I thought there was no way this proof could possibly be made any simpler, and I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>35 Over 35</title>
<link>https://theamericanscholar.org/35-over-35/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theamericanscholar.org/35-over-35/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://theamericanscholar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35-over-35-750x394.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading one too many articles about the next crop of “Best 35 Writers Under 35,” we decided to compile a list of 35 writers who all got their start &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the age of 35. In the process, we were surprised (and heartened) to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://theamericanscholar.org/the-seven-best-books-weve-ever-received/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some of our favorite writers&lt;/a&gt; among them. To all the procrastinators out there, this one’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Djuna Barnes, &lt;em&gt;Ryder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll take our cue from the author herself and ignore the 1915 chapbook &lt;em&gt;The Book of Repulsive Women&lt;/em&gt;—an “idiotic” title, Barnes said, and she torched copies to keep them out of the public’s hands—leaving the modernist’s semi-autobiographical novel &lt;em&gt;Ryder&lt;/em&gt; as her first true work. She published it when she was 36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Alice Munro, &lt;em&gt;Dance of the Happy Shades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theamericanscholar.org/what-do-you-want-to-know-for/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The masterful short-story writer&lt;/a&gt; from Ontario didn’t publish her first collection, &lt;em&gt;Dance of the Happy Shades,&lt;/em&gt; until 1968, when she 37. Munro went on to receive numerous accolades, including three Governor General’s awards, the Man Booker International Prize, and the Nobel Prize for Literature, which she won in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Ursula K. Le Guin, &lt;em&gt;Rocannon’s World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the best science fiction novels ever written, &lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Dispossessed,&lt;/em&gt; take place in the alternate universe first established in Ursula K. Le Guin’s debut, &lt;em&gt;Rocannon’s World,&lt;/em&gt; published in 1966 when she was 37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Newton Thornburg, &lt;em&gt;Gentleman Born&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few fanatical evangelists will recognize the name Newton Thornburg today, but his 1976 novel &lt;em&gt;Cutter and Bone&lt;/em&gt; is as deft and smartly written a crime novel as you’ll find, evoking with great panache the seedier side of 1970s Santa Barbara. Thornburg worked numerous jobs before turning to writing full-time, producing his first book, &lt;em&gt;Gentleman Born&lt;/em&gt; in 1967, at the age of 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Anthony Burgess, &lt;em&gt;Time for a Tiger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Anthony Burgess of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theamericanscholar.org/the-sound-of-evil/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; fame. He published his first novel, &lt;em&gt;Time for a Tiger,&lt;/em&gt; at age 39, in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Sherwood Anderson, &lt;em&gt;Windy McPherson’s Son&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood Anderson, the erstwhile owner of a paint factory and a workaday advertising writer in Chicago, published his classic &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/opinion/winesburg-ohio-sherwood-anderson.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winesburg, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in 1919. His first book, &lt;em&gt;Windy McPherson’s Son,&lt;/em&gt; came out three years earlier, when Anderson was only 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. George Eliot, &lt;em&gt;Adam Bede&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was 40 years old, having already written several essays and other short pieces, Mary Ann Evans published her first novel, &lt;em&gt;Adam Bede,&lt;/em&gt; under the pseudonym George Eliot. A little more than a decade later, she would write her masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Katherine Anne Porter, &lt;em&gt;Flowering Judas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truly modern woman, Katherine Anne Porter has an equal number of books and ex-husbands to her name. Her debut collection, &lt;em&gt;Flowering Judas and Other Stories,&lt;/em&gt; which was published when she was 40, already tackles many of the themes that would appear in her later works: social criticism, religious disillusionment, a complex love for the American South—and an exploration of the lives of strong, stubborn women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Roberto Bolaño, &lt;em&gt;The Skating Rink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s debatable when the enfant terrible of the Chilean literary world debuted—do we count a 1984 novel, never translated into English, that he co-wrote with A. G. Porta? His first solo novel, &lt;em&gt;The Skating Rink,&lt;/em&gt; came only in 1993, though, after the birth of his son persuaded him to swap writing poetry for putting food on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. William S. Burroughs, &lt;em&gt;Junky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William S. Burroughs of &lt;em&gt;Naked Lunch&lt;/em&gt; fame (or infamy), published his first book, &lt;em&gt;Junky,&lt;/em&gt; at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. G. V. Desani, &lt;em&gt;All About H. Hatterr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Kenya in 1909, Desani spent his childhood in India and, at the age of 17, landed in England, where he embarked on a successful career as a journalist, teacher, and gifted orator. His first book, &lt;em&gt;All About H. Hatterr,&lt;/em&gt; was published in 1948. It’s a comic masterpiece, a brilliant, whirling novel that revels in its Anglo-Indian milieu and has been championed, over the years, by the likes of Saul Bellow and Salman Rushdie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Maya Angelou, &lt;em&gt;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a prolific writer, Angelou did not publish her first book until 1969, when she was 41. &lt;em&gt;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&lt;/em&gt; brought Angelou to the international stage as the first nonfiction bestseller by an African-American woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. P. D. James, &lt;em&gt;Cover Her Face&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When P. D. James’s husband returned from World War II, he suffered a mental breakdown, forcing James to work as a National Health Service administrator to support her family. During this period, she began to write detective stories, publishing her first, &lt;em&gt;Cover Her Face,&lt;/em&gt; when she was 42.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Walker Percy, &lt;em&gt;The Moviegoer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he trained as a doctor, Walker Percy, after contracting tuberculosis at 26, quit his job in medicine and spent his time recuperating, reading, and writing. He published the first of his six novels, &lt;em&gt;The Moviegoer,&lt;/em&gt; almost two decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Helen DeWitt, &lt;em&gt;The Last Samurai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen DeWitt wrote dozens of books between menial jobs before she was able to publish &lt;em&gt;The Last Samurai,&lt;/em&gt; her 50th, at the age of 43. After 11 years out of print, the novel was reissued with its original title in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. Bram Stoker, &lt;em&gt;The Snake’s Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working as an actor’s manager, Bram Stoker, who would later inaugurate the modern-day vampire craze with his book &lt;em&gt;Dracula,&lt;/em&gt; published his first book, &lt;em&gt;The Snake’s Pass,&lt;/em&gt; when he was 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. André Aciman, &lt;em&gt;Out of Egypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If publishing a book by 35 doesn’t work out, waiting until you’re 43 is the next best bet. That’s when André Aciman, a professor at the City University of New York, published his memoir, &lt;em&gt;Out of Egypt,&lt;/em&gt; to rave reviews. His 2007 novel, &lt;em&gt;Call Me By Your Name,&lt;/em&gt; was later made into a movie starring Timothée Chalamet (and he’s also written &lt;a href=&quot;https://theamericanscholar.org/author/andre-aciman/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;essays for the &lt;em&gt;Scholar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18. Zora Neale Hurston, &lt;em&gt;Jonah’s Gourd Vine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time she wrote her first novel, &lt;em&gt;Jonah’s Gourd Vine,&lt;/em&gt; over the span of three months in 1934, Zora Neale Hurston was already a well-known figure in the Harlem Renaissance movement. She continued to draw on her own life and those of the African Americans she spoke to during her travels in the Deep South for the rest of her literary career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. Wallace Stevens, &lt;em&gt;Harmonium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1923, at the age of 44, a successful insurance executive named Wallace Stevens published his first collection of poems, &lt;em&gt;Harmonium&lt;/em&gt;. Some three decades later, his &lt;em&gt;Collected Poems&lt;/em&gt; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. Alex Haley, &lt;em&gt;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most famous for his 1976 novel, &lt;em&gt;Roots: The Saga of an American Family,&lt;/em&gt; Haley published his first book, &lt;em&gt;The Autobiography of Malcolm X,&lt;/em&gt; in 1965, when he was 44.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21. Kate Atkinson, &lt;em&gt;Behind the Scenes at the Museum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working toward her doctorate in American literature, Kate Atkinson failed the oral examination, leading her to pursue a variety of jobs—legal secretary, teacher, home help. She exacted her literary revenge, of sorts, at age 44: her debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Behind the Scenes at the Museum,&lt;/em&gt; won the 1995 Costa/Whitbread Book of the Year and First Novel awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22. Karen Blixen, &lt;em&gt;Seven Gothic Tales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Blixen, better known by her pen name Isak Dinesen, is also better known for her second book, &lt;em&gt;Out of Africa,&lt;/em&gt; a memoir of life on a coffee farm in Kenya. But her first book, &lt;em&gt;Seven Gothic Tales,&lt;/em&gt; won praise when it was first published in the United States in 1934, when Blixen was 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23. Raymond Chandler, &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creator of the noir hero Philip Marlowe didn’t write his first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep,&lt;/em&gt; until he was 50. He went on to complete six more novels, as well as an impressive number of short stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24. Richard Adams, &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Adams originally told the story of &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt; to his two young daughters to pass the time on a long car trip. He finally decided to write it down, and since the book was published when he was 52, it has never gone out of print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25. Annie Proulx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she published several nonfiction gardening and cider-making guides in her 40s, Annie Proulx’s fiction-writing career began to take off when she published her short story collection, &lt;em&gt;Heart Songs and Other Stories,&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, when she was 53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26. Anna Sewell, &lt;em&gt;Black Beauty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sewell’s beloved novel about a beloved horse, &lt;em&gt;Black Beauty,&lt;/em&gt; was published in 1877, a year before her death at 58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27. Daniel Defoe, &lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defoe was a political journalist-turned-novelist who published his first book, &lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe,&lt;/em&gt; in 1719, at the age of 59.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28. Penelope Fitzgerald, &lt;em&gt;The Golden Child&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English writer Penelope Fitzgerald, who spent much of her life raising children amid terrible poverty—including occasional periods of homelessness—published her first novel at age 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29. Ulysses S. Grant, &lt;em&gt;Personal Memoirs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great autobiographies by an American, it was written as he was dying of throat cancer. It was published in 1885, when he was 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30. Laura Ingalls Wilder, &lt;em&gt;Little House in the Big Woods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Ingalls Wilder, at the urging of her daughter, began publishing her “Little House” series, about her life growing up on the American frontier, in 1932, when she was 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31. Frank McCourt, &lt;em&gt;Angela’s Ashes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank McCourt was 66 when he published his first book, &lt;em&gt;Angela’s Ashes,&lt;/em&gt; a tragicomic memoir of his upbringing amid an impoverished Irish family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32. Bridget Quinn, &lt;em&gt;Broad Strokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art historian Bridget Quinn published scholarly articles, but she didn’t publish her first book, &lt;em&gt;Broad Strokes&lt;/em&gt;—which highlights overlooked female artists—until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33. Harriet Doerr, &lt;em&gt;Stones for Ibarra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel set in a “a declining village of one thousand souls” in Mexico, where a middle-aged American couple has mortgaged everything to reopen a copper mine once owned by his grandfather. Doerr published this book in 1984, when she was 73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34. Clyde Rice, &lt;em&gt;A Heaven in the Eye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir, set between 1918 and 1934 in and around San Francisco, evokes a workingman’s world of strong passions and a love of living. Rice published this book in 1984, when he was 81.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35. Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, &lt;em&gt;The Leopard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, an Italian nobleman, had already been dead for a year when &lt;em&gt;The Leopard,&lt;/em&gt; his first book, was published in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;
