&lt;p name=&quot;9dd2&quot; id=&quot;9dd2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-dropCapImage&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*X9-2OmFXN5ltEJ3D2GzEnA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X9-2OmFXN5ltEJ3D2GzEnA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCapText&quot;&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;elly Oggenfuss is walking into the woods. Leading her team of four young researchers through a thicket of slender oak trees, she doles out assignments by letters corresponding to a grid. As early morning light filters through the canopy, Oggenfuss and her colleagues pull on latex gloves then disperse to gather surveillance data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;021c&quot; id=&quot;021c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For 20 years, this has been a post-dawn ritual for Oggenfuss, a senior research specialist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York, a bucolic town in the state’s Hudson Valley region. Four times a week from April to November — traditionally the most active tick season in the Northeast — she leads a platoon of field researchers as they don white coveralls, drive a pair of old Chevy Tracker SUVs down an overgrown dirt road, and hike to a five-acre tract designated “Henry Control” on the grounds of the institute. Their mission is to seek out and study ticks in one of the most tick-infested areas in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84e8&quot; id=&quot;84e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Oggenfuss and the others work methodically across a grid of 242 spring-loaded box traps, checking for rodents lured overnight by whole-oat seeds. Sharing updates via walkie-talkie, the team gathers after a squirrel is found in one of the traps. The new researchers transfer the animal to a plastic mesh sleeve and take turns examining it. A similar process unfolds with chipmunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0444&quot; id=&quot;0444&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most often, the traps capture mice, which Oggenfuss and her team carry with them&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; still in the trap, until the grid check is complete. Then the group convenes around a collapsible table. As one researcher records data (grid location, gender, tag number, etc.), the others apply tags to the mice and collect blood, urine, and stool samples. Finally, Oggenfuss and her team meticulously comb the mice with tweezers and blow on their fur, pushing it aside in search of ticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;75&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9b3f&quot; id=&quot;9b3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;“Look there’s a nymph,” says Oggenfuss. “And I’ve got one, two, three larvae. Can you see them?” She pulls a patch of the mouse’s fur back to reveal a blacklegged tick no bigger than a poppy seed burrowed into its head. The larvae are barely perceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba35&quot; id=&quot;ba35&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A researcher named Agi holds up another mouse. “Look,” she announces. “That’s a larva on top of that nymph. We have a co-feeding situation here.” The theory is that their feeding sites are so close that pathogens move between them easily, Oggenfuss explains. The potential result is one tick sharing infectious material directly with another through the host mouse as if it were a straw, speeding the spread of disease. “That could have an effect on infection prevalence,” Oggenfuss adds. “It’s one of the things we’re studying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f12&quot; id=&quot;3f12&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since 1992, the Cary Institute has been compiling a record of tick ecology that they believe to be the longest continuous study of this kind in the U.S. and possibly the world. Mostly its researchers encounter the blacklegged, or deer, tick (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt;), but in recent years, they’ve also been seeing increasing numbers of lone star ticks (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Amblyomma americanum&lt;/em&gt;), which are native to the American Southeast but now range from northern Mexico to Canada. Over the years, an alarming number of ticks in the surrounding area have been revealed to carry &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, while others have tested positive for the pathogens that cause other tick-borne illnesses, including the potentially fatal Powassan virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7658&quot; id=&quot;7658&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because ticks acquire pathogens from hosts, understanding tick-borne diseases means understanding ticks’ so-called disease reservoir, especially mice. If the urban rat was the primary carrier of bubonic plague, the country mouse is it for Lyme disease. And just as the fleas that fed on infected rats spread the plague, ticks that feed on infected mice transmit Lyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;234d&quot; id=&quot;234d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On this early May morning, the team’s trap yield is relatively modest — four mice, two squirrels, and a chipmunk. “It’s early days still,” says Oggenfuss. In August, during the so-called larval peak, the researchers sometimes catch as many as 220 mice and can find 150 or even 200 tick larvae crawling on a single mouse. It can be an unnerving moment. “When the ticks are looking for a feeding site,” Oggenfuss says, “the mouse fur just seems to move on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d948&quot; id=&quot;d948&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The process for counting ticks not affixed to hosts is called a drag — the researchers pull a one-square-meter sheet of fabric along the ground for 30 meters then tally the number of ticks affixed to it. Oggenfuss holds the Cary Institute record for ticks collected in a single drag: 1,700. As horrifying as that haul was — and it would, by extrapolation, put the tick population on the Cary Institute’s 2,000-acre campus at 2 billion — Oggenfuss is quick to note it was exceptional, and tick density is irregular. Her more conservative calculations of average tick populations, based on drags done during the same time of year (August, the larval peak), are only reassuring by comparison: upward of 20,000 ticks per acre, more than 100,000 on the Henry Control grid, and more than 40 million on the Cary Institute grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;219.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d3e8&quot; id=&quot;d3e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The scary thing is, that’s nothing. Experts say the worldwide tick population is exploding, triggering a dramatic spike in the incidence of Lyme disease and a rise in other tick-borne illnesses, some of which, like Powassan, are far more dangerous than Lyme.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. has more than doubled in the two decades leading up to 2017 (the most recent year for which final figures are available) and increased 17% from 2016 to 2017 alone. More than half the counties in the U.S. are considered high-risk areas for Lyme, according to the CDC, and in some areas, as many as six out of 10 ticks carry the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1757&quot; id=&quot;1757&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“It’s been a relentless expansion since the 1980s,” says John Aucott, director of the Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “There may be down years and up years, but the trends are in place, and there’s no indication that they’re going to reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;43f6&quot; id=&quot;43f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We now live in a frightening new normal: It’s estimated that 300,000 people contract Lyme every year in the U.S., with victims found not just in traditionally tick-heavy areas like upstate New York and Maine, but also in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. While most people are cured quickly with antibiotics, some go on to experience lingering symptoms characteristic of Lyme, like headaches, fatigue, and joint and muscle pain, for months or longer after they’ve been treated, a condition known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). According to a recent study led by experts at the Brown University School of Public Health, the number of people in the U.S. with PTLDS was estimated to be 1.5 million in 2016 and is predicted to rise to nearly 2 million by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is little doubt that [Lyme disease] is pandemic. It calls for a huge national and concerted international effort to bring it under control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5589&quot; id=&quot;5589&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Tick populations now exist on every continent, even Antarctica, and Lyme disease can be found throughout most of Europe, where it ranks as the most common vector-borne disease, and beyond. “To me, there is little doubt that it is pandemic,” says Mary Beth Pfeiffer, author of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Lyme: The First Epidemic of Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s in China, Russia, Japan, Australia. It’s moving fast into Canada. It is all across the U.S. It calls for a huge national and concerted international effort to bring it under control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a4c3&quot; id=&quot;a4c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The incidence of other tick-borne illnesses is also sharply rising. According to the CDC, the occurrence of those diseases in the U.S. has nearly tripled since 2004 and increased more than 22% from 2016 to 2017. In addition to Lyme, ticks transmit a slew of pathogens, including those that cause babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, southern tick-associated rash illness, tick-borne relapsing fever, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Powassan encephalitis. Most of the bacterial diseases are treatable if diagnosed early. Others, like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are potentially fatal, particularly in children, if not treated quickly. Incidences of spotted fever rickettsiosis, which includes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, increased more than 12-fold from 2000 to 2017 (up from 495 to 6,248). And while more rare still, cases of Powassan virus, which can kill one in 10 people who are infected and for which there is no treatment, are rising as well. In 2008, only two cases were reported. In 2016, that number jumped to 22 and again in 2017 to 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c227&quot; id=&quot;c227&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Ticks account for more diseases than all other biting insects and arthropods in the United States,” says Ben Beard, deputy director for the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the CDC. “It’s hard to know what the maximum or the ceiling might be. All we can say is that the number of cases is growing every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d113&quot; id=&quot;d113&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Alarms are going off all over the globe. South Africa, where tick-bite fever (a form of rickettsias) is common, has seen an increase in incidences of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is deadly in 30% to 40% of cases. The tick that carries CCHF, a native of sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Europe, has been found in Spain, Portugal, Germany, and the United Kingdom, where it is believed to have been brought from Africa by migratory birds. Bites from the lone star tick have been shown to cause alpha-gal syndrome, which manifests in rapid-onset allergies to meat, typically beef and pork, that can result in unexplained anaphylactic reactions. There is no treatment, other than eschewing the consumption of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4fb3&quot; id=&quot;4fb3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In North America, news reports in Maine and southern Canada this spring featured a shocking number of sightings of what are called ghost moose — skeletal-looking, malnourished, denuded animals that have rubbed off their fur in response to tick irritation after hosting up to 75,000 feeding ticks through the winter. Many emerged anemic after being the source of so many blood meals, and a number of calves died after losing too much blood to ticks — a vampire-like end to life known as exsanguination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85ba&quot; id=&quot;85ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If Lyme disease has reached pandemic proportions, why haven’t we heard more about it? Because, experts say, Lyme doesn’t strike fear into people’s hearts the way some other illnesses, like Ebola or Zika, do. People respond to dramatic pictures or dramatic mortality, says Aucott. “It’s hard for them to have a perspective on the real impact of Lyme disease because it doesn’t cause visible changes. People with Lyme disease don’t look sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5ccb&quot; id=&quot;5ccb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The same dynamic holds true for other tick-borne illnesses, says Beard. “People don’t have to be dying all over for this to be a huge health problem. These are serious illnesses, and some do result in deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;46d1&quot; id=&quot;46d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a report on the dangers of ticks, the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academies, called ticks “the Swiss Army knife of disease vectors,” emphasizing their remarkable adaptability and efficiency in spreading illness. Although conspiracy theorists have suggested — falsely — that Lyme disease was created in a U.S. military lab, it is true that in the years following World War II, the U.S. employed top German scientists who explored the tick’s potential in biological warfare for Nazi Germany. The researchers were investigating the tick’s ability to spread pathogens across wide areas with the potential to incapacitate entire populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d79e&quot; id=&quot;d79e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Seventy-five years later, the tick timebomb is detonating on its own. Thanks to climate change, globalization, and other factors, ticks are not only proliferating but also becoming more malignant, more aggressive, and more likely to carry infection. A public health crisis is hiding in plain sight, with tick-borne diseases creating millions of sick people at an economic cost running into the billions, and little has been done so far to mount a meaningful defense. On every walk in the woods or picnic in the park, we are encountering more ticks. And as Willy Burgdorfer, the entomologist who identified the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, once proclaimed: “There is no such thing as a clean tick.”&lt;/p&gt;

The research assistants transfer the mouse blood, urine, and fecal samples they’ve gathered to an Igloo cooler marked “NIH” and send them to be tested for, among other things, the pathogen that causes Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a0f1&quot; id=&quot;a0f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A dozen or so clear plastic canisters labeled “extra ticks” are strewn across Oggenfuss’ desk, all marked with a collection date and grid location. Inside of each, on a bed of plaster of Paris, are groups of ticks, some nymphs, some adults. Oggenfuss reaches up, grabs a pair of high-magnification granny glasses that are resting on a deer skull, and hands them to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;681e&quot; id=&quot;681e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Use these,” she says. She hasn’t confirmed the species of each tick yet. “They’re probably all blacklegged, but I’ve been surprised before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd99&quot; id=&quot;bd99&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Taxonomically, the 800-plus species of ticks fall into one of three families — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Ixodidae&lt;/em&gt; (hard ticks, like the blacklegged tick and dog tick), whose life spans range from one to two years; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Argasidae&lt;/em&gt; (soft ticks), which can live as briefly as several months or as long as a dozen or more years; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Nuttalliellidae&lt;/em&gt; (a single elusive species in sub-Saharan Africa). They are part of the order of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Parasitiformes&lt;/em&gt; and the classification &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;arachnid&lt;/em&gt; (although many varieties emerge as larvae with six legs and develop eight legs as nymphs). Ticks progress through four stages — egg, larva, nymph (argasid ticks will go through up to seven phases of the nymph stage), and adult. Adult female blacklegged ticks have a bright orange-red body; adult males are dark brown to black. Even at their biggest, ticks are small — measuring between three and five millimeters long, or slightly larger than a sesame seed when mature — with a diminutive head on a plump, pear-shaped body. When engorged, they can swell to many times their unfed weight: 200 to 600 times in hard ticks, five to 10 times in soft ticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19b9&quot; id=&quot;19b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In order to survive, ticks must feed on hosts, which can be mammalian, avian, amphibian, and reptilian, a minimum of three times — once at every stage after they hatch from the egg — before adult males die and females lay eggs, between 2,000 and 5,000 of them. Depending on the species, ixodid ticks will feed on either one, two, or three separate hosts in the course of their life cycle; argasids will feed on more depending on how many nymphal stages they undergo. Multihost ticks present the greatest risk: On each feeding after the first, either on a different host species or a different member of the same species, a tick can transmit bacteria and viruses from one host to the next. Hence, ticks, like mosquitoes, are known as disease vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;208f&quot; id=&quot;208f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to some researchers, ticks veered off from the mite family tree as far back as 450 million years ago; other scientists date their emergence to the Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago. Thanks to specimens trapped in amber, we know ticks were feeding on feathered dinosaurs 99 million years before they began being featured on identification charts in veterinarian’s offices and in hiker’s handbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;510.22056432884&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5656&quot; id=&quot;5656&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Contemporary ticks “don’t look much different at all from those preserved specimens,” says Rick Ostfeld, a distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute, the leader of the Tick Project, and arguably the country’s preeminent researcher into the ecology of tick-borne diseases. “They are very conserved morphologically throughout their evolutionary history, more so than most groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d780&quot; id=&quot;d780&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The tick’s early adaptations have aged well, starting with its barbed feeding tube, called a hypostome, which penetrates the host’s skin and is moored in place by a glue-like secretion produced by the salivary glands. Tick saliva itself contains an almost alchemist’s mix of elements: Pain-killing enzymes called kininases make bites barely, if at all, noticeable to hosts; anti-inflammatory compounds keep the wound site from becoming irritated and the tick from being detected during its sometimes days-long feeding period, and anticoagulants keep the blood meal flowing freely all the while. Over time, ticks have become adept at sensing hosts when questing for a blood meal, learning to detect movement, body heat, odor, moisture, respiration, and carbon dioxide. Some species can even detect shadows cast by nearby creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d7c&quot; id=&quot;4d7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The characteristics that have helped ticks endure for eons — surviving numerous periods of warming and ice ages (including the 2.5-million-year Pleistocene ice age), mass extinctions, and years of plenty and years of famine thousands of times over — also help them from season to season. “They have massive reproduction, they have super long lives, especially for a parasite, they don’t need to feed often, they’re very tiny, and they are very resistant,” Ostfeld says. “They are able to escape nasty conditions. They just go into suspended animation in the cold. They have antifreeze molecules they mobilize seasonally. They don’t need much oxygen — a close to zero rate of respiration when not feeding — so they can be underwater for a few days, even a few weeks.” Although they are deceptively easy to kill in a lab with extreme heat or cold — or at home by putting tick-covered clothes in the dryer or freezer — in the outdoors, ticks are adept at finding shelter in the leaf cover or soil to insulate themselves from severe temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bee2&quot; id=&quot;bee2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It seems surprising Hollywood hasn’t tried to mine the star power of relentless, blood-eating, disease-spreading creatures that reproduce by the thousands and can’t be killed off. “I’m not an expert in that area,” Beard says, “but it seems like you could create a pretty good horror film out of all that.”&lt;/p&gt;

While the relationship between changes to the climate and the spread of ticks and tick-borne disease is complex — tied to host populations and hosts’ food supplies, among other factors — this much is clear: Human-driven climate change is making tick season longer and tick country larger. As winters get warmer and shorter, ticks become dormant later in the year (if at all should it fail to fall below freezing) and active earlier. Ostfeld has observed the timing of spring nymphs move up by a month in the past two decades. Lyme Disease Awareness Month, May, now arrives after Lyme-carrying blacklegged tick nymphs do in the Northeast U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ff0&quot; id=&quot;5ff0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Tick maps are changing as fast as the calendars, as species like the deer tick have spread northward from temperate zones to regions with boreal forests. This helps explain why the Public Health Agency of Canada only began tracking cases of Lyme disease in 2009. From that year through 2017, Lyme cases in Canada increased more than 14-fold, from 144 to 2,025. In 2017, Maine had the highest per-capita incidence rate of Lyme of any state in the U.S. and reported a 23% year-over-year increase in cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8ebf&quot; id=&quot;8ebf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There was a time when human impact on the environment helped suppress the threats posed by ticks. The radical clear-cutting of forests and overhunting of deer in the 19th and early 20th centuries lowered the transmission of Lyme disease. In recent decades, however, changes in land use, reforestation efforts, and other factors have combined with warming temperatures to exacerbate it. “You’ve got climate change moving it north, you’ve got suburban growth into wooded areas, you’ve got rebounding deer populations,” says Beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3021&quot; id=&quot;3021&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To compound matters, ticks themselves are undergoing a simultaneous, seemingly unrelated evolutionary change. Disease ecologists have observed the ascendance of a particularly aggressive genetic population, or clade, of blacklegged ticks that are overtaking more docile clades in the southern U.S. “This northeastern clade moving southward is causing more cases of human Lyme disease,” Beard says, “because these ticks’ behavior is changing. They’re more likely to bite people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f10a&quot; id=&quot;f10a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When Aucott joined Johns Hopkins in 1996, Lyme disease had been a mounting concern for a number of years, but conventional wisdom held that the illness would not spread south of the Potomac River. However, he soon began seeing case referrals from first northern then southern Virginia. Lyme is now endemic in North Carolina and has moved westward to Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f62c&quot; id=&quot;f62c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“It jumped,” Aucott says. “We also know there’s no geographic barrier to the spread of Lyme disease south of Maryland and literally out through to the Mississippi River Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce07&quot; id=&quot;ce07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In early May, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released a devastating report that concluded that 1 million species of flora and fauna face extinction due to human activity. Disease ecologists who study ticks say biodiversity is critical in curbing the spread of Lyme disease: “High diversity dilutes transmission,” says Ostfeld. “As you lose diversity, the species that remain typically are the ones that amplify the disease.” Among the species sure to survive the coming die-off are ticks and the rodents that serve as disease reservoirs for them. “We’ll never lose mice,” Ostfeld explains. “Mice are cockroaches with fur.” So even as the biome is depleted, ticks will not only survive, but will become more likely to carry disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3782&quot; id=&quot;3782&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Globalization is also heightening the threat posed by ticks. Although U.S. Department of Agriculture officials screen livestock traveling internationally for parasites, they do not screen pets, migratory birds, planes, boats, or people for them. Among the CDC’s greatest concerns is non-native and invasive tick species that have the potential to spread across the country unabated. One already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d17&quot; id=&quot;9d17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In October 2017, Andrea Egizi, a research scientist with the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Tick-Borne Disease Lab, was one of a team of experts who investigated an unusual infestation of ticks. A resident in nearby Hunterdon County had become covered in larval ticks while shearing one of her sheep. “The reason this raised a red flag,” Egizi recalls, “was because there were just so, so many ticks.” There were hundreds on the sheep in question and more than 1,000 more in the paddock — an inordinately high count for the type of ticks normally found in the region, none of which these specimens resembled under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cfd6&quot; id=&quot;cfd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sure enough, Egizi couldn’t find the tick on any of the taxonomic keys that identify species from the region. She and her colleagues contacted the Smithsonian for help to no avail. “We were pretty sure it was something exotic, but we didn’t know what,” Egizi says. “Then I did the DNA barcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;913a&quot; id=&quot;913a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Her sequencing search returned with a match to &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Haemaphysalis longicornis&lt;/em&gt;, the Asian longhorned tick. It was the first time the tick had been reported in the United States. Egizi, who had never heard of the species, began doing additional research. “That’s when I realized it could be a big problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b3d2&quot; id=&quot;b3d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Asian longhorned tick transmits an emerging hemorrhagic fever found in China, Korea, and Japan called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Experts suspect it spreads Rickettsia japonica, which causes Japanese spotted fever. The species previously spread to New Zealand and Australia, where it has wreaked havoc on livestock populations, particularly cattle (it is a vector for a frequent condition called fatal bovine theileriosis). What’s more, in Asia, the longhorned tick carries pathogens that are also present in North America, including forms of anaplasma, babesia, borrelia, ehrlichia, and rickettsia. As of now, it has not been found to feed on rodents or carry human pathogens in the U.S., although CDC research on its so-called vector competence is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0488&quot; id=&quot;0488&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“It may just be a matter of time,” Beard says. “Then it gets to the issues of how much does it feed on rodents? How much on people? What is the relative risk to humans? It’s hard to know whether it will be a game changer or if it will just incrementally to add to the concerns we already have. The jury is still out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2d9b&quot; id=&quot;2d9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The particular strain of Asian longhorned tick found in New Jersey is parthenogenetic — that is, it can reproduce without mating. A single female can lay 2,000 genetically identical eggs every six months as opposed to every two years for most North American ticks. That may explain the startling numbers of tick larvae found on the sheep. Scientists generally refrain from using the term “self-cloning,” but it is hard to avoid in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0347&quot; id=&quot;0347&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In less than two years since Egizi’s discovery, there have been more than 50 reports of Asian longhorned ticks around the United States. Most were found on wildlife and domestic animals, but two were found on humans. The species has been reported as far north as Connecticut and as far south as Arkansas, and Egizi says the tick is likely to have spread elsewhere. “There are definitely places where no one’s found it yet,” she says, “because no one’s looked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d3b&quot; id=&quot;1d3b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An examination of previously unidentified samples done after the discovery of the Asian longhorned tick in New Jersey revealed that the species had actually been in North America years before 2017. One specimen found at the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories was collected from West Virginia in 2010. That was deeply unsettling, says Beard. “That, of course, raises the question: Is it possible we have other invasive species here that we’ve not even recognized yet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d9b1&quot; id=&quot;d9b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s also possible they are present but not able to proliferate — yet. One working hypothesis at the CDC is that the Asian longhorn tick had been in the U.S. in low numbers but only began to spread rapidly after adapting to its new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da02&quot; id=&quot;da02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, Egizi is comparing the DNA of her sample with those of specimens around the world, trying to find the most likely population from which it came. The goal is to determine just how it arrived. “It’s a concern how vulnerable our systems are,” she says. “For example, the fact that dogs are not checked for extra parasites when they come into the country, that is shocking to me. There’s also concern about ticks expanding their distribution within the U.S. or within North America. It’s not just from overseas that we need to be concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;618a&quot; id=&quot;618a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That very scenario is playing out on the U.S.-Mexico border in Mexicali, where a particular clade of brown dog tick has caused a massive outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can be fatal in up to 30% of cases and causes more deaths than any other tick-borne disease in North America. This tick, a tropical variety, differs from the common temperate clade of its type found in North America, which almost exclusively feeds on canine hosts. “The one in Mexicali is a very aggressive tick that is more predisposed to bite people,” says Janet Foley, a professor of veterinary medicine and epidemiology at University California, Davis who specializes in disease ecology. “If it spreads to the United States in numbers, that’s dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4df7&quot; id=&quot;4df7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As of 2018, three years after the Mexican Ministry of Health declared an epidemiologic emergency, more than 4,000 people had been diagnosed with Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexicali, which has a population of approximately 700,000. Several hundred have died, including, according to reports, at least four who were infected in Mexicali and later crossed into the U.S. Foley co-authored a study with researchers at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California that concluded the epidemic is not contained — it has spread to other parts of Baja California and is moving into the United States. The most immediate fear is an outbreak in a major city like Tijuana, with a population of more than 2 million. “Hundreds of people have already died, and millions more are at risk,” says Foley. The tick is already there and has already moved north. Recently it’s been reported in San Diego and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b1e2&quot; id=&quot;b1e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While ticks need moisture to survive, the common brown dog tick requires far less than most. This particular clade takes that to the extreme, suggesting its spread could be hastened by climate change. “This tick needs it hot and it needs it dry. This tick is rooting for global warming and drought,” Foley says. As places like California and Arizona become hotter and drier, the tick’s reach will expand, she says. To compound matters, research has shown that the hotter the temperature, the more aggressive this tick becomes. “You can actually do experiments and bring the temperature up and increase the bite rate of that tick,” Foley says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;29c0&quot; id=&quot;29c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;She remembers driving through Mexicali with a local tick expert and being struck by the lack of leaf cover. When she asked where the ticks were found, he pointed not at vegetation but a patch of dirt in a front yard and mentioned they also like the stucco on the sides of houses. Foley experienced it herself, standing in an infested courtyard. “The ticks sense that there’s a body there,” she recalls, “and they start to crawl out of cracks in the walls. It’s unnerving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;19e5&quot; id=&quot;19e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lyme can be difficult to diagnose. To identify it, doctors generally rely on symptoms (the bull’s-eye rash) and circumstances (having been in a tick-infested area) rather than a blood test because the antibodies that indicate the presence of the disease can take weeks to appear in tests, resulting in false negatives. The lack of a reliable test means people often go untreated longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1c8e&quot; id=&quot;1c8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The headaches, fever, muscle and joint pain typical of the illness’s early stages are comparable to flu symptoms and, if the disease is left untreated, can become severe. In rare cases, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease can enter the heart, blood, or brain, and people may experience irregular heartbeat, nerve pain, or dizziness. In extremely rare cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/7165daec4cb1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/7165daec4cb1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lyme can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people’s symptoms can leave them in pain for months or years, and the lack of effective treatments and skepticism among some people that their condition is real can leave people feeling anxious and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b9a&quot; id=&quot;6b9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because children are especially vulnerable to Lyme disease (kids tend to spend more time outdoors than adults and are less cautious about where they venture), the threat of the illness is a source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/64f8b0b275c3&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/64f8b0b275c3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;widespread anxiety among parents&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have shown that tick-borne diseases disproportionately affect the rural poor, people employed in manual and farm labor and other outdoor vocations, and people with limited access to health care. Lyme also contributes to the overuse of antibiotics and the rise of drug-resistant bacteria, which is a serious public health threat of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8844&quot; id=&quot;8844&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Recent studies estimate the medical costs of Lyme disease at $1.3 billion per year. When accounting for indirect costs, including loss of work, that figure is thought to be between $50 billion and $100 billion. But that number doesn’t factor in PTLDS cases. “That is a tiny fraction of the true cost,” says Pfeiffer. “It only reflects [people who] are diagnosed and treated quickly. Those aren’t the ones for whom treatment failed or who don’t get diagnosed or who get diagnosed with something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0631&quot; id=&quot;0631&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s more, Pfeiffer says, the Lyme outbreak is being badly mismanaged. “This disease has been very much underestimated. We don’t have a good test. We have treatments that fail. We seem to have very little urgency to respond. That lack of urgency means we simply have not spent the money needed on this epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

In the hall, Oggenfuss, Ostfeld, and the others listen intently to the process of building a predictive computer modeling system for the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b76e&quot; id=&quot;b76e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Later, Ostfeld and Shaman meet to discuss similar methods for forecasting the spread of Lyme disease. Although the expression is “mighty oaks from little acorns grow,” mice too survive on the tree seeds. Ostfeld’s field teams are creating a model that links high annual acorn production to a surge in the mouse population through the summer and fall, which in turn leads to spikes in the number of Lyme-infected nymphs the following spring. It’s light-years from Shaman’s detailed weekly predictions for 108 U.S. cities. But that model is for the flu, which caused the most severe pandemic in modern history from 1918–1920 and is now the subject of concerted and coordinated worldwide health efforts. Each year, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System selects the strains of the influenza virus to target with its seasonal vaccine, which is manufactured and distributed worldwide. In the U.S., it is administered free in many workplaces and widely available at local pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1378&quot; id=&quot;1378&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lyme and other tick-borne diseases have yet to receive anything like that sort of attention. In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration approved a Lyme disease vaccine called Lymerix, administered in a three-injection cycle, that reduced infections in adults by nearly 80%. But it was discontinued three years later after sales bottomed out, due in large part to public fears driven by negative news reports over its side effects (most notably arthritis) and a class-action lawsuit whose claims were debunked. It was an early victory for the anti-vaccine movement, which gained momentum thanks to a now-retracted study linking autism to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine that was released the same year as Lymerix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7374&quot; id=&quot;7374&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“That actually scared me,” says Joyce Sakamoto, an entomologist at the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University who has researched public engagement strategies to improve tick-borne disease literacy. “That was a case where the anti-vax community was able to effectively kill something entirely without a lot of scientific evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83d6&quot; id=&quot;83d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For now, the only vaccines in use for humans against tick-borne diseases target viral, not bacterial, infections (for instance, tick-borne encephalitis, which is endemic in central Asia as well as Europe, where widespread vaccination has proven effective). Over the past 10 years, however, there has been increasing scientific inquiry into a one-stop shop — a vaccine that would inoculate against all tick-borne diseases by targeting the proteins in tick saliva to block the transmission of pathogens. This would be a game changer, but the research is still in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c25&quot; id=&quot;4c25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;More immediately, a new Lyme vaccine called VLA15, developed by French biotech firm Valneva, is undergoing clinical trials in Europe. Although it was given fast-track status by the FDA and seems likely to be approved in the United States, there is no guarantee it will be adopted by the public. As a result of low demand and anti-vaccine agitation, there is a chance the drugmaker will choose not to distribute it in the U.S. “I don’t know how that’s all going to work out. They are trying to address the potential PR fail that could happen, even if you have a really good product,” says Sakamoto. “If the risk of disease outweighs the risk of the side effects — and this is true of any drug — people are more likely to take the drug. But if they feel like it’s something they can survive, it’s not a big deal, they’re going to disregard it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af81&quot; id=&quot;af81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health database, there are eight ongoing trials involving Lyme disease, and there have been 59 since its cause was identified in 1982. Lyme advocates say that’s far too few. “There is a very solid case to be made that Lyme disease deserves a lot more attention and a lot more money,” says Pfeiffer. “It’s a source of great consternation to me and to a lot of other people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d4b4&quot; id=&quot;d4b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which authorized the Health and Human Services Department to establish a Tick-Borne Disease Working Group to advise Congress and the secretary of HHS on research priorities and coordination. In late May, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Tina Smith of Minnesota, both of whose states are now hotbeds of Lyme disease, introduced S.1657, a piece of legislation called the Ticks: Identify, Control, and Knockout (TICK) Act, which allocates $100 million over the next several years for the study of tick-borne disease and new treatments. Although a companion bill was recently introduced in the House of Representatives, the legislation is currently languishing in committee, and its prospects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;82ce&quot; id=&quot;82ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Those whose jobs it is to foresee and prepare for real-life disasters and apocalyptic events, the Department of Defense and DARPA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, are acting more decisively. Along with the EPA, they are funding Ostfeld’s research into the links between ticks and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a4a&quot; id=&quot;6a4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Through the Tick Project, Ostfeld is also investigating tick control methods. Historically, most tick eradication efforts have done as much harm as good — the Soviet Union’s widespread use of DDT, for instance — largely because chemical agents that kill ticks also exterminate all other bugs and endanger water supplies. Ostfeld and the Tick Project are focusing on environmentally sensitive bioagents that kill ticks but affect as few other creatures as possible. “We’re using a naturally occurring native fungus,” Ostfeld says, “and it is pretty specific to ticks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9c26&quot; id=&quot;9c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;To be exact, he and his team are studying a type of pathogenic fungus called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/em&gt; strain F52, which is applied to foliage and soil. Its spores then attach to passing ticks, penetrate their exoskeletons, and reproduce inside them until they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6bcd&quot; id=&quot;6bcd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The compound is not some closely held secret — it’s sold commercially as MET52. When Ostfeld had to halt research last year after being unable to order an adequate supply, it was not because a foreign government or the World Health Organization had started stockpiling it. “California pot growers were buying up huge amounts,” he says, noting that it control whiteflies and other crop-eating insects. “They can use it and still sell their pot as organic.” At least as Ostfeld envisions it, the bioagent would not be carpet-bombed across large regions, but rather used to create buffer zones around homes, woods-adjacent communities, and the like. That is the same application Ostfeld envisions for another product he is testing called the Tick Control System — a small box that attracts mice and other small mammals to enter, then applies a small dose of fipronil, the active ingredient in Frontline, which is widely used to kill ticks on dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f167&quot; id=&quot;f167&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Other, more high-tech ways to stop the spread of Lyme, such as an attempt by MIT researchers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/48f81e7a3fec&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/48f81e7a3fec&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genetically engineer Lyme-resistant mice&lt;/a&gt;, are being investigated but are years from being deployed, if it turns out they work at all. In the meantime, experts recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/3115adac772f&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/3115adac772f&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prevention and treatment measures&lt;/a&gt; like wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts in areas where ticks proliferate and conducting frequent tick checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dfbc&quot; id=&quot;dfbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Cary Institute sells “I Brake for Opossums” bumper stickers. The decals don’t do anything to curtail tick-borne diseases themselves, but preserving opossums populations can. Unlike mice, opossums are not so-called “permissive hosts,” Ostfeld explains. They are efficient at eating ticks while grooming and are not a disease reservoir. Unfortunately, Ostfeld explains as we sit in his office, mice are far more numerous than possums, and they are like magnets to tick larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9156&quot; id=&quot;9156&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Look, a larva would be lucky to crawl from me to you across this table in five hours, right? But it’s likely to find a mouse passing on the forest floor,” says Ostfeld, walking his finger slowly across his desk toward me. Once that larva feeds on a mouse, or any infection-carrying host, everything changes, he says. The tick is effectively weaponized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc33&quot; id=&quot;bc33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re already losing the war on ticks and Lyme disease, Ostfeld says; most of us just don’t realize it. “People ask me all the time, when they find out what I do, whether we’ll live to see the age of the tick. We’re already in it. The real question is, what do we do now?”&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/344672/How_id_built_Wolfenstein_3D_using_Commander_Keen_tech.php</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following excerpt is a chapter of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/&quot;&gt;Game Engine Black Book:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/&quot;&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;, an in-depth examination of the history, code, and development of id Software's influential Nazi-killing first-person shooter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter reflects on the game's origins and how it was built atop the success and tech of id's &lt;/em&gt;Commander Keen&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;itself created out of the bones of a failed attempt to sell Nintendo on a &lt;/em&gt;Mario 3&lt;em&gt; PC port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by author and programmer Fabien Sanglard, the full book is now available in both &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/&quot;&gt;physical and digital editions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990 a small company based in Shreveport, Louisiana was doing well in the shareware market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a video game subscription service, Softdisk produced and mailed new games every month to its members. Business was good but some of its employees had other ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They thought they had the skills to make it big and they wanted to prove it. They had created a new way to program side scrolling. They called the technology &quot;adaptive tile refresh&quot; and it enabled hardware scrolling on a PC capable of rivaling a NES. In early 1990 they worked non-stop over a weekend to reimplement &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3&lt;/em&gt; on a PC and demonstrate their skills to Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was successful in building a clone of &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt;, but unfortunately &quot;Ideas from the Deep&quot; as they called themselves failed to convince Nintendo to give them a contract. As impressed as they were, the Japanese firm wanted the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; series to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We sent this demo to Nintendo of America, they in turn sent it to Kyoto to the mothership office, and the execs there saw the demo and were really im pressed. However, they didn’t want their intellectual property on anything but their own hardware, so they told us Good Job and You Can’t Do This.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- John Romero, programmer​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/wolfexcerpt1(1).PNG&quot;/&gt;This episode was enough to convince them they had not only the talent to feed their ambitions, but also the teamwork and work ethic to potentially go all the way. In February 1991 four Softdisk employees took the leap of faith and founded their own company: &quot;id Software&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/wolfexcerpt2.PNG&quot; width=&quot;638&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For ample details, read &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidkushner.com/book/masters-of-doom/&quot;&gt;Masters of Doom&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by David Kushner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They immediately used the technology developed for &quot;&lt;em&gt;Mario 3&lt;/em&gt; PC&quot; to release their own titles and build their own intellectual property. Wasting no time, the team shipped no less than three titles annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Commander Keen&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Episode 1, 2, and 3: Invasion of the Vorticons&lt;/em&gt; (December 14th,&lt;br/&gt;1990)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Commander Keen&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Episode 4, 5, and 6: Good Bye Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; (December 15th, 1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Commander Keen&lt;/em&gt; standalone game: &lt;em&gt;Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter&lt;/em&gt; (December 1991)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games, published by FormGen, were instant successes and sold very well. They also kept on writing games for Softdisk to publish, most of which featured adaptive tile refresh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Commander Keen in Keen Dreams&lt;/em&gt; (1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&lt;/em&gt; (1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Rescue Rover&lt;/em&gt; (1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Rescue Rover 2&lt;/em&gt; (1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Shadow Knights&lt;/em&gt; (1991)&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Hovertank 3D&lt;/em&gt; (April, 1991).&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Catacomb 3D: A New Dimension&lt;/em&gt; (November, 1991)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Spring of 1991 the next generation of id Software technology started to surface. &lt;em&gt;Hovertank 3D&lt;/em&gt; placed the player inside a tank. There was no texture mapping yet and the pace was quite slow. &lt;em&gt;Catacomb 3D&lt;/em&gt; marked the introduction of textures and took immersion one step further by placing the player in control of a magician in first person view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1991, the team was free from any obligations to SoftDisk. Their next game was going to feature the 3D technology they were building and would be called &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;. Given the magnitude and ambition of the title, four more people were added to the team for a total of eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;125&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/wolfexcerpt3.PNG&quot; width=&quot;637&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jason was part of id at the start, but we parted ways during Wolf development.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- John Carmack, programmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;456&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt4.PNG&quot; width=&quot;509&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt5.PNG&quot; width=&quot;513&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1991, following Tom and Jason’s high-school memories of the area, the team relocated from Shreveport, LA to Madison, WI. They established their office in a two story brick building at The Pines apartment complex, 2622 High Ridge Trail. They all lived in walking distance of the office except for John Carmack who, since he did not care, inhabited the second floor of the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt; started in January 1992. As temperatures fell and snow dumped from the sky, the team kept itself increasingly busy and barely left the office. Development lasted four months and &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt; was released in May 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;429&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt7.PNG&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these four months, the organization of the team was pretty much standard for a game studio of this era: four guys crammed in one room, dictating a fast pace and strong sense of camaraderie (and a lot of noise disturbance given John Romero and Tom Hall’s type of interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map (below) you can see on the upper floor the SNES where countless games of &lt;em&gt;F-Zero&lt;/em&gt; were played and the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons area extensively mentioned in &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;. To have a team member (John Carmack) with his apartment directly above the studio was not out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We started with floppy data transfer, but we had a Novell network on coax Ethernet by the end*. We didn’t have a version control system. Surprisingly, we went all the way to Quake 3 without one, then we started using Visual Source Safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- John Carmack, programmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Comment from John Romero: &quot;We bought a $7000 Novell Netware 3.11 system while in Madison, WI in November 1991. This included the file server, cables, and network cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;676&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt8.PNG&quot; width=&quot;510&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody was working with the best PC money could buy, a high end 386-DX 33MHz with 4MiB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development was done with Borland C++ 3.1 (but the language used was C) which by default ran in VGA mode 3 offering a screen 80 characters wide and 25 characters tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Carmack took care of the runtime code. John Romero programmed many of the tools (TED5 map editor, IGRAB asset packer, MUSE sound packer). Jason Blochowiak wrote important subsystems of the game (Input manager, Page manager, Sound manager, User manager).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;454&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt9.PNG&quot; width=&quot;637&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borland’s solution was an all-in-one package. The IDE, BC.EXE, despite some instabilities allowed crude multi-windows code editing with pleasant syntax highlights. The compiler and linker were also part of the package under BCC.EXE and TLINK.EXE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no need to enter command-line mode however. The IDE allowed to create a project, build, run and debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt10.PNG&quot; width=&quot;636&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the tiny CRT display, some of the developers used two screens. (Note from John Romero: &quot;Both John and I had small 12' amber monochrome monitors we used with Turbo Debugger&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;816&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt11.PNG&quot; width=&quot;646&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;835&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt12.PNG&quot; width=&quot;646&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;814&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt13.PNG&quot; width=&quot;646&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All graphic assets were produced by Adrian Carmack (Kevin Cloud did a few textures and also worked on the design and layout of the &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt; hint book). All of the work was done with Deluxe Paint (by Brent Iverson, Electronic Arts) and saved in ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap) files (Deluxe Paint proprietary format).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;530&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt14.PNG&quot; width=&quot;644&quot;/&gt;Since the VGA is palette-based (colors were not specified via 24-bit RGB but via indices pointing to a 256-color table) the creative process was difficult. Adrian had to first make the key decision of which colors would go in the palette (some games like &lt;em&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt; used multiple palettes depending on the section of the game; id Software went for a simpler solution with one palette for the whole game), then draw everything with only those colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt15.PNG&quot; width=&quot;646&quot;/&gt;The palette coordinates run 0x00 to 0x0F horizontally and 0x00 to 0xF0 vertically. The horizontal blue gradient at the bottom starts at 0xF0 and ends at 0xFE. 0xFF (represented in pink) is a special color deemed transparent by the engine and always skipped during rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All assets were hand drawn with a mouse. Since the VGA stretched the framebuffer when displaying it on the screen, Adrian had to be careful to draw at the same resolution as the game would run (320x200).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adrian and Kevin both worked directly in Deluxe Paint, we didn’t have any scanning tools at the time.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- John Carmack, programmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphic assets are divided in two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2D Menu items shipping with the game in VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD, and VGADICT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Action phase items (walls and sprites) shipping in the VSWAP archive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets Workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the graphic assets were generated, a tool (IGRAB) packed all ILBMs together in an archive and generated a C header file with asset IDs. The engine references an asset directly by using these IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;485&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt16.PNG&quot; width=&quot;639&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt17.PNG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; This system led to issues when the source code was released. The .h header files provided did not match the asset files from the shareware or early versions of &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;. The headers released were from Spear of Destiny. You can see the kind of graphic mess this led to in the article &quot;Let’s compile like it’s 1992&quot; on fabiensanglard.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wolfenstein-Hint-Manual-Official-Players/dp/B000LPNV1O&quot;&gt;The Official Hint Manual for &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; published in 1992 explains the creative process. It contains many drawings from Tom Hall and shows many behind the scene sketches made by Tom Hall and pixelarted by the graphic team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;When Id’s Creative Director, Tom Hall gets an idea for a screen, he provides a sketch for Adrian Carmack. Below are some of Tom’s early designs for the title screen. The third sketch was chosen.&quot; - Official Hint Manual for Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;https://gamasutra.com/ckfinder/userfiles/33864223/wolfexcerpt19.PNG&quot; width=&quot;646&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What&amp;#039;s Salesforce?</title>
<link>https://tryretool.com/blog/salesforce-for-engineers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tryretool.com/blog/salesforce-for-engineers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Customer-relationship management is the biggest, fastest growing software market in the world. $40B is spent on CRMs annually, and almost all companies have one. But for those of us that don’t directly use a CRM… what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CRM is the source-of-truth for all customer data and interactions. Need to know what features your salesperson promised, and when? How much revenue you have from each customer? Or which salesperson sold the most in the past year? Check the CRM. Your CRM is the key to understanding the business side of your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is the most popular CRM in the industry. It’s worth $120B, owns 20% of the CRM market, and is used by 83% of Fortune 500s. The company employs over 30,000 people, and Salesforce Tower is the tallest skyscraper in the San Francisco skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entire economy is built around Salesforce. For every dollar that Salesforce makes, its ecosystem generates $4. Millions of developers build apps for Salesforce’s platform, and Salesforce development is itself a lucrative niche within software engineering. The IDC estimates that by 2022, Salesforce will have created 3.3 million new jobs, as well as $800B in new business revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, enterprise software has a reputation for being clunky, boring, and slow. But Salesforce, the archetype of enterprise software, actually pioneered much of what we now take for granted in tech, including selling software as a service (=&amp;gt; SaaS), and hosting software in the cloud (=&amp;gt; AWS), all while creating a massively valuable company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how Salesforce took over the world, it helps to understand how sales worked, before Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, sales used to be a completely manual process. Companies stored contacts on physical index cards (a “rolodex”), who they targeted by direct mail or telemarketing. With the advent of personal computing in the 1980s,“ contact management services” started cropping up, digitizing the salesperson’s rolodex. “Database marketing” became the next hot thing, and companies started storing customers and leads electronically. This let them segment their leads and target them with custom marketing messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn10.phillymag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/frank-rizzo-estate-sale-rolodex.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the market moved towards a single idea: a unified store of all customer data with features to automate the sales process, including contact management, task tracking, and reporting. Different companies gave it different names — SFA (Sales Force Automation), CIS (Customer Interaction Software), ECM (Enterprise Customer Management), and a host of other TLAs (three-letter acronyms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One eventually stuck — CRM (Customer-Relationship Management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whyuseacrm&quot;&gt;Why use a CRM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing sales details is a basic requirement of running any business. You interact with various entities throughout your day — individual contacts inside existing companies (&lt;code&gt;Contacts&lt;/code&gt; in Salesforce lingo), individual contacts who might become customers (&lt;code&gt;Leads&lt;/code&gt;), companies themselves (&lt;code&gt;Accounts&lt;/code&gt;), deals with a company (&lt;code&gt;Opportunities&lt;/code&gt;), etc. And every time you interact with them, you’ll be either writing notes down, or referencing previous notes. For example, when a lead comes in and is interested in purchasing, you’ll want context: have you called them before? What’s their use case? When should you follow up on them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting out, a spreadsheet works well. You have multiple tables (&lt;code&gt;Contacts&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Companies&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Opportunities&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Leads&lt;/code&gt; etc.). Sure, manually checking before you enter each row (for duplicates, validating inputs, validating foreign keys, etc.) takes effort, but you don’t have that many customers anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as you get more customers, you’ll want a variety of features (various validations, triggers on creating rows, de-duplication logic, etc.), which spreadsheets don’t always offer. That’s where a CRM comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CRM is the single source of truth for all your business-critical data. It’s where you track lead data — how much they’re worth, how far along they are, and how likely they are to close. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_my_email_2_sfdc_landing_page.htm&amp;amp;type=5&quot;&gt;connects with your email&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreach.io/blog/understand-your-sales-performance-with-updated-call-analytics-pr&quot;&gt;sometimes even your phone&lt;/a&gt;) to automatically sync interactions with them. Unlike a spreadsheet, it’s designed to automate data entry, and minimize errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tryretool.com/blog/content/images/2019/02/Unified_Interface_1b.png&quot; alt=&quot;A typical CRM interface&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all your data is in the CRM, you can run reports on it. For example, you could group deals by salesperson responsible (find your top performing salesperson), by industry + company size (find your sweet spot: CPG companies between 100 - 1000 employees), or whatever else. Salesforce, for example, even allows you to write &lt;code&gt;SOQL&lt;/code&gt; (“Salesforce Object Query Language”, which is very similar to SQL) to run reports. Oh, the power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, you might think CRMs are valuable, but boring. Just a CRUD app, plus some automated email + call logging, right? Well… most CRMs are just that — CRUD apps with automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;entersalesforce&quot;&gt;Enter Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business is unique. Different domains have different entities — you might need to track a “faculty” within a “university” for selling to academia. And different organizations have different processes — you might need a specific “lead qualification” view if your team has specialized Sales Development reps. How do CRMs handle these varying needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the model. Maybe you need custom views and controllers as well! Many SaaS apps are worse than internally-built ones, often because you can’t customize the UI. For example, we use Intercom, and it’s oftentimes infuriating that simple, mundane tasks (e.g. email this lead now) isn’t possible. It would be great if we could just add a button into the view… but of course, we can’t edit it, since it’s a SaaS product that we bought, and have no control over! (This is related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickcollison.com/questions&quot;&gt;Patrick Collison’s question on programming end-user applications&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some CRMs force all companies into a one-size-fits-all setup. Salesforce is so successful, in large part, because it doesn’t. Its killer feature, instead, is its flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a database, Salesforce lets you create new tables with custom columns and relationships, complete with data types and constraints. For selling to academia, you can create new “university” and “faculty” objects that can be linked to each other and attached to each “lead” object. Unlike a database, Salesforce lets you do this without writing any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_577969A0B5A9C13CA16448B1FE0937C6CAAA0EC108C48DF4F40260AEB4408C14_1550146165702_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a frontend framework, Salesforce lets you can create new views with custom layouts and UIs. For a lead qualification process, you can create a dashboard showing only unqualified leads and the information needed to approve/reject them. Unlike a frontend framework, Salesforce lets you do this without writing any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_577969A0B5A9C13CA16448B1FE0937C6CAAA0EC108C48DF4F40260AEB4408C14_1550146289828_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like AWS Lambda, you can write arbitrary code and trigger it by &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;ing to the Salesforce API. Unlike Lambda, though, this code can be triggered automatically by database events — after a &lt;code&gt;Lead&lt;/code&gt; is edited, or an &lt;code&gt;Opportunity&lt;/code&gt; is created,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Salesforce’s custom data models and interfaces, every company’s setup is unique. Viewed that way, Salesforce isn’t just a CRM — it’s a platform for building CRM-like apps, but with sane defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce’s point-and-click database editor and drag-and-drop UI builder alone make it much more than a CRM. But when you bolt on other apps and 3rd-party APIs, it gets close to programming without code: a new way to build software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom data models and UIs makes the vanilla Salesforce platform configurable enough (by non-engineers!) to meet most business needs. AppExchange then enables a host of new functionality via “plug-and-play” apps, allowing for even more custom setups. And finally Apex fills any final gaps, letting developers write custom code for truly bespoke features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Salesforce get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;abriefhistoryofsalesforce&quot;&gt;A brief history of Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the late 90s, a seasoned enterprise software executive was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2014/07/behind-the-scenes-at-salesforcecom-our-aloha-spirit.html&quot;&gt;sitting inside a hut in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, thinking about the future. (This was parodied in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Gj0o8m5lBbk&quot;&gt;Episode 3 of Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 10 years he’d lived Oracle’s business; one of multimillion-dollar up-front costs, multi-year-long on-premise implementations, and constant maintenance overheads. He’d also seen the trend in consumer software towards simplicity and ease-of-use, led by online bookstore Amazon.com. He wondered how to do the same to enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This executive was Marc Benioff. Returning from Hawaii, he set out to simplify enterprise software with a new company called Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce’s first innovation wasn’t its features, but its business model. Benioff wanted software to be a utility, like electricity. So he gave Salesforce simple subscription pricing that scaled according to usage. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000303134956/http://www.salesforce.com/info/products.html&quot;&gt;In 1999, it was $50/user per month&lt;/a&gt;. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software, at the time, was synonymous with complexity and cost. With its counter-culture philosophy, Salesforce needed to differentiate itself. They did so, and not subtly — the company’s first marketing slogan was “No Software”, and, conveniently, their phone number became 1-800-NO-SOFTWARE. Most of the company were against this — negative advertising is generally a bad idea. But for Salesforce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/07/marc-benioff-logo-brand-advice.html&quot;&gt;it worked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.carnalsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/logo-salesforce-no-software.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55e61babbd86ef13008b773c-480/ap01072502966.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company that wanted to end software, Salesforce sure contributed a lot to its progress. 6 years in, they launched the first ever “app store”, creating a brand new method of software distribution. This pre-dated even Apple’s, but not by coincidence —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs gave Benioff his first programming job (writing assembly) back in 1984. Benioff describes him as one of the greatest mentors he’s ever had. During one of their meetings in the early 2000s, Jobs gave a piece of advice that changed Salesforce’s trajectory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to build an application economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s an application economy?”, Benioff asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marc, you’re gonna figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; figure out. In 2005, they launched AppExchange, an online marketplace letting anyone develop and distribute apps that connect with Salesforce. Because those apps live inside Salesforce and can read / write Salesforce data, they’re extremely powerful. For example, the Mailchimp app lets you subscribe people inside Salesforce directly to Mailchimp. But it also includes a front-end that allows you to see a lead’s interactions with previously sent emails (e.g. Alice viewed your marketing email 5 times, and clicked on the Foo feature three times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some AppExchange apps integrate into Salesforce’s web app, while others are standalone with a backend integration. Billions are now spent annually on thousands of AppExchange apps, and entire companies have been built on it — &lt;a href=&quot;https://financialforce.com&quot;&gt;FinancialForce.com&lt;/a&gt;, for example, lets you build an enterprise resource planning system (ERP) in Salesforce, employs over 750 people and has raised $200M since it was founded in 2009, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benioff originally planned to call it “App Store” — he even registered the ‘appstore.com’ domain — but market research suggested that “exchange” was the better metaphor. The domain didn’t go to waste, though — Benioff gifted it to Jobs at the launch of the iOS App Store, along with the “App Store” trademark. It continues to be a major part of Apple’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;1.1550802139037&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot; readability=&quot;4.620320855615&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The last time I saw Steve Jobs he asked this photo to be taken. I did not realize how important it would be to me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/FnFbzNG6BC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FnFbzNG6BC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/377851503534678016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;11 September 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years following AppExchange, Salesforce launched a set of products more faithful to their “no software” goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was Apex, the Lambda-like service that allowed Salesforce users to write arbitrary code. Apex apps, once installed via AppExchange, could access the user’s database and Salesforce’s client-server interfaces, so made almost any custom functionality possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was Visualforce, a component-based UI framework that made it easy to build custom interfaces for Salesforce. Its simple markup let developers build UIs that were consistent with the rest of the Salesforce app, and that could easily talk to Salesforce’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Visualforce code would generate a form with a dropdown list of objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;apex:page controller=&quot;objectList&quot; &amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;apex:form &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;apex:SelectList value=&quot;{!val}&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;apex:selectOptions value=&quot;{!Name}&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/apex:selectOptions&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/apex:SelectList&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/apex:form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/apex:page&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this Apex controller code would fetch the list of objects from the organization’s schema:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;public class objectList{
  public String val {get;set;}

  public List&amp;lt;SelectOption&amp;gt; getName()
  {
    List&amp;lt;Schema.SObjectType&amp;gt; gd = Schema.getGlobalDescribe().Values();     
    List&amp;lt;SelectOption&amp;gt; options = new List&amp;lt;SelectOption&amp;gt;();
    
    for(Schema.SObjectType f : gd)
    {
       options.add(new SelectOption(f.getDescribe().getLabel(),f.getDescribe().getLabel()));
    }
    return options;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_577969A0B5A9C13CA16448B1FE0937C6CAAA0EC108C48DF4F40260AEB4408C14_1549281355379_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, these were consolidated into Force.com — a platform for developers to build and run apps without worrying about infrastructure. It was the first platform-as-a-service (PaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force.com opened up Salesforce’s services and architecture to developers, who flocked to build custom Salesforce apps on it. It wasn’t just faster to develop on — Force.com also made distribution significantly easier. Apps on the platform benefitted from Salesforce’s own security, which IT departments already approved of, so Force.com apps were easier to sell to enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce continues to launch new products every year to enhance its offering. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud#Corporate_history&quot;&gt;$3.6B of acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; were turned into the Salesforce Marketing Cloud in 2012, a suite of tools for digital marketing automation. Einstein Analytics was launched in 2016, adding a layer of “AI-powered” analytics across the entire Salesforce stack. And in 2018, the company entered a new vertical with a CRM specifically for healthcare — Salesforce Health Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Salesforce called for “the end of software”, Salesforce was referring to the legacy model of enterprise software: boxed, bloated, and sold via salespeople. Today, they’ve succeeded in changing how software is built, bought, and deployed across enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Please read before renting out your own gear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Recently, I rented out my camera equipment on &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitsplit.com/&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;KitSplit&lt;/a&gt; to a renter, who decided not to return it. The outcome is not a happy one, but a lesson learned for myself and hopefully anyone else who is considering renting out their equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;This written account is aimed towards making it crystal clear for gear owners, vendors, and future KitSplitters what type of risk and liability they are responsible for when using these types of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I signed up on KitSplit and was immediately drawn in by their promise for a safe and trusted community for filmmakers to rent out their gear. I thought to myself “Wow, they even have a dedicated trust page”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kitsplit.com/trust&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;https://kitsplit.com/trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;One specific area that KitSplit talks about in-depth is their proprietary vetting system, even claiming it to be the “best in the business”by KitSplit co-founder Lisbeth Kaufman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;After feeling reassured by KitSplit’s safety protocols, I went ahead and listed my gear on their site. A renter named “Mark” was interested in renting my Sony A7III Kit ($3500 replacement value) for a day ($89 rental price). Minus KitSplit fees and taxes, I made $70 from this rental.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;In hindsight, I should have seen the red flags from our interaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Odd pickup times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;No urgency to pick up for a next-day shoot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Didn’t bother to ask if the batteries were charged beforehand since he’s picking up gear on the morning of his shoot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Claimed to be a first-time renter but mentioned “I don’t ever get any messages from KitSplit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;We eventually agreed on new pickup times and he was there, 7AM on the dot, he promised to return it in a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;But then evening came and I haven’t heard from Mark, so I reached out to him… no response. In fact, he stopped responding to my messages altogether:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;After a deep pit feeling in my stomach, I immediately reported my suspicions to KitSplit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Unable to rest since someone disappeared with $3500 of my gear, I decided to look up KitSplit’s policy for owners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I thought, “Well, at least I’m covered by KitSplit’s insurance, they put a deposit on the renter’s card, or at the very least, my personal insurance may cover this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;The next morning came and I followed-up with KitSplit to see if they had heard back from Mark and if not, then what our next course of action will be. This is the response they sent me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Unexpectedly, I received this lawyer-like email from KitSplit and became introduced to the term “voluntary parting” for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;voluntary parting is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;When the renter disappears with the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Not covered by their insurance…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Made clear in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitsplit.com/terms-of-use&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and “elsewhere on the site.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;An exclusion that is stated on “every conversation page”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I clicked on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitsplit.com/terms-of-use&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and found the policy which they were referring to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;ho jl&quot;&gt;“KitSplit Inc. is not liable for a User’s deceptive or fraudulent acts, voluntary parting of the gear, theft of Gear, or any other loss caused by a User’s deceptive or fraudulent acts through KitSplit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Wait a minute, where else on the site does it state that “KitSplit Inc. is NOT liable for a User’s deceptive or fraudulent acts” ???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I mean I had to dig within the agreement terms in order to find this. Feeling confused, I googled “KitSplit voluntary parting” and this is the first article that came up on KitSplit’s website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;As you could imagine, I felt puzzled and conflicted at this point from what I’ve read and what I was being told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;On the one hand, KitSplit told me that they are not liable for any fraud or theft I experience as an owner on their platform, but on the other hand that they will work with their insurance partners to promptly fix, or replace my item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;KitSplit proceeds by telling me what actions I should take since they are not liable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I called my insurance and asked to file a claim for stolen gear. They said sure, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I explained that I rented my camera out on KitSplit and the renter never returned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;*Dreaded silence…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;“I’m so sorry… but that’s voluntary parting which you don’t have coverage for. In fact, voluntary parting insurance is rare and was only available to rental houses and not owner/ops until recently. Lastly, the reason insurance companies do not offer voluntary parting insurance to renters is because they are not going to cover someone who plans on committing theft by fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Hard for me to imagine a company within the film industry not keep their word and put their vendor at a loss of $3500 (especially since our word is everything in this industry), I still had reason to believe that KitSplit, a company that promised a safe and trusted community, would do the right thing. I asked KitSplit if they charged late fees or a deposit on the full replacement value of my equipment as promised with their “secure payment processor that includes fraud protection services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;This is what they said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I set up a phone call with KitSplit and told them off the bat “Hey, I understand that you guys are not legally liable for what has happened to me according to your terms of use, but what about all the other promises that you have made on your site? All the protocols and steps you would take in order to prevent or fix this, etc.?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;“Sorry, our insurance only covers damage and theft to the renter. Not voluntary parting to the owner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;To be honest, things started to get emotionally stressful over the phone since I could not believe what I was being told after the amount of trust I was being asked to put into their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Why would any sane person rent out their gear to a stranger unless there was a third-party to keep each person accountable and provide insurance if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Bottomline, I realized I handed my camera off to a thief for $70, KitSplit who facilitated this voluntary parting under the false pretense of being safe also profited from this transaction, but as the gear owner who trusted the system and signed up as a vendor on KitSplit, I’m silently given the bill of $3500. Even worse, I couldn’t help but feel at fault and had no one to blame but myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;KitSplit continued to explain to me over the phone that in instances like this, they have worked with the NYPD and law enforcement authorities to recover stolen and missing gear in cases where the equipment value is $200,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;As a result, I asked “does that mean the authorities are going to help me with my case?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;They replied, “unfortunately no since the value of your equipment is only $3,500.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I can confirm this statement since the SFPD filed my police report but explained to me that they would not investigate the matter or help me recover my stolen property since this is a civil dispute — meaning I needed to find the thief and negotiate with him in a civilized manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;KitSplit clarified to me as to how Mark passed their proprietary vetting system — he stole the identity of a photographer name Mark and must have photoshopped a photo of him holding “Mark’s” I.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I wondered how hard it was to change my identity on KitSplit and still be verified as a trusted user:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;After a series of bad news, KitSplit then said they would discuss with their co-founder Kristina on whether or not they will “partially cover” my loss out of a kind gesture on their part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;KitSplit ended the phone call on a hopeful note, “look, we’re filmmakers as well just like you so we know what you’re going through, but you have to trust me that I’m on your side and that I will talk to Kristina and do my best to make your case heard on your behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I held onto their word for the next few days waiting to hear back on their decision. I made sure to send them my receipts and proof of purchase of the items as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;We were wrapping up a shoot in the middle of the day and I checked my phone to see if there were any good news. This is what they came back to me with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I came to a low-point after hearing that KitSplit decided not to cover my claim without providing me with any explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;It was a lonely feeling to be in. Knowing that I would not receive help from insurance, law enforcement or KitSplit. Additionally, I watched my stolen property being sold on Craigslist — that was the sweet icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;But then I discovered an important email. Not from KitSplit, but from another KitSplitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;All of a sudden, I wasn’t alone on this. We will call this KitSplitter “Jane.” I called Jane immediately and we instantly found comfort in each other’s situation. Apparently, Mark disappeared with her camera the same day he took mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;We felt odd that KitSplit didn’t alert us to each other’s experience or disable Mark’s profile even though this happened to two people… possibly even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;I asked Jane how KitSplit handled her situation and she shared with me their interaction via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;To my surprise, the emails they sent to her were almost indistinguishable from the ones that were sent to me — the only difference being our names. They sent us automated scripts tailored for this specific case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Curious about how other companies handled this issue, I took a look at KitSplit’s competitor’s website, Sharegrid, to see what their policy on voluntary parting was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Here is an excerpt from &lt;strong class=&quot;ho jl&quot;&gt;Sharegrid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;They both shared the same policy on volunteer parting. But the difference was how they conveyed their policy. Sharegrid details what happens if a renter does not return the gear to the rightful owner, how the act is called voluntary parting, why their insurance does not cover it and what you need as an owner to insure yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;On the other hand, KitSplit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://intercom.help/kitsplit/articles/1763380-what-is-voluntary-parting-and-what-is-the-difference-between-theft-and-fraud&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; describes how voluntary parting is different from theft, how their insurance policy “may not” cover fraud or voluntary parting, and then reminds you how unlikely this will happen to you. They also make a promise that they will “do everything in their power to help you retrieve your gear,” and lastly recommends that you “consider” voluntary parting coverage for “peace of mind” without ever explicitly giving a reason as to why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;In the end, I understand that I am responsible for reading the User’s agreement terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;However, I discovered that there has been many KitSplitters beyond Jane and I who have gone through the same predicament. It became evident that this is clearly a much larger pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;These owners all have reported that they felt deceived by KitSplit’s policy, did not receive support from KitSplit, and some even mentioned that their communication was cut short by KitSplit by not having their emails and phone calls returned — leaving voluntary parting cases unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;A written account on this loophole felt mandatory at this point after hearing how many owners have lost their gear through KitSplit without redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;KitSplit promises that renters are vetted and that vendors are covered. However, if they cannot deliver on either of these promises, then they should consider discontinuing their service until they fix their errors or at the very least, cease to advertise these unreliable promises in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Additionally, a lawyer friend of mine has pointed out that the terms of use that we’ve agreed upon with KitSplit is a contract set up to devoid them of liability for serious potential crimes, like theft. I hope KitSplit takes action towards their “voluntary parting” loophole by either actively reminding owners of this exclusion before every rental request or by reconsidering their arguably predatorial terms of service/contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Because in the end, I genuinely do think that KitSplit is a great idea on paper and I want to root for them. However, their actions are far from being aligned with their core values and the promises they have made. I hope this article opens a line of dialogue between KitSplit and its vendors so that their platform can one day actually be a safe and trusted film community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Most likely, if this was news to you, then it will be news to another filmmaker. For this reason, I would appreciate if you shared these lessons I’ve learned moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Takeaway lessons for gear owners on any rental platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Document serial numbers on all your equipment and/or initial them permanently — make it evident to authorities that the property belongs to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Legitimate rental houses charge the rates they do because of their insurance and liability coverage. The reason platforms like KitSplit are able to make rentals cheaper is because they do not provide the same level of insurance and liability coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Purchase comprehensive rental insurance and volunteer parting coverage if you plan on renting out your gear. Owners are 100% liable for their equipment beyond what renter’s insurance covers (damage + theft).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Voluntary parting in most states is considered either fraud or theft by fraud. Which usually makes it a civil case instead of a crime. Therefore, law enforcement will typically not make any effort to investigate and recommend you to either pursue the renter or the company through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/small_claims/file.shtml?fbclid=IwAR0eG7ngjXTel0JPo5idbnKEoSzC1W5XieUzi3zoJvbR2cuTZuScUK8MWro&quot; class=&quot;aq cc gt gu gv gw&quot;&gt;small claims court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Make sure to document the renter’s physical I.D., license plate number, and receive a certificate of insurance from them in order to take the ultimate precaution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. For this reason, don’t trust a company with a trust page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp iw hr ix ht iy hv iz hx ja hz it iu iv&quot;&gt;Assume nothing. Do your own vetting and take everything with a grain of salt. Lots and lots of salt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;hm hn eq bh ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz&quot;&gt;Note: Please reach out if you or anyone you know have gone through a similar situation on KitSplit. We’d like to hear from you at exkitsplitters@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Discount Brokerages Make Money</title>
<link>https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is outside of my usual software-oriented beat, but sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/386/&quot;&gt;people are wrong on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, people have been wrong about payment for order flow, an esoteric topic in the investing industry which seems vaguely unsavory to Hacker News &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20005229&quot;&gt;commenters&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Lewis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#michael-lewis&quot;&gt;[0]&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining why payment for order flow isn’t a big deal requires a more in-depth discussion of discount brokerages. All stats below are as of 2018; citations for the annual reports are at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-discount-brokerage&quot;&gt;What is a discount brokerage?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is not a full-service brokerage, which used to charge several hundred 1970s dollars to place a single stock trade and which used to &lt;em&gt;call you&lt;/em&gt; to convince you of the desirability of paying them several hundred dollars to place a single stock trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-05-04/investing-stores-and-libyan-bribes&quot;&gt;investing store&lt;/a&gt;, which exists to get the mass affluent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#mass-affluent&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  to allocate a portion of their net worth to assets other than bank deposits and real estate, but is almost entirely indifferent to what they actually want to invest in. They carry a variety of products, like listed US stocks, perhaps a few bonds, probably mutual funds, perhaps options and futures, and the like, and feel about them about the same as Netflix feels about horror versus anime: it literally doesn’t matter as long as you consume it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is a marketing operation which both does a lot of uncompensated education about investing and retirement savings and also spends a metric shedload on advertising, partially underwriting substantially all media which touches financial topics (and a lot of higher-end lifestyle media besides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is a retail franchise, similar in character to a bank or cell phone store, where absolutely nothing important happens in the branch offices other than convincing you that, if you call them, someone will be able to reset your password, check your account balance, or otherwise walk you through a routine customer service request. This brand promise is, fundamentally, true; they have some of the best telephone support operations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage maintains many large, boring computer programs which interface with clearing, custody, and settlement firms and the banking system to move bits representing money around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discount brokerage is a thin user interface over a more complicated API to the financial markets, allowing an unsophisticated retail investor to send a limit order to buy five shares of Google trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are all different ways of looking at reality, and are mostly true. Except that last one. Discount brokerages mostly don’t actually talk to stock exchanges; that’s a specialized, detail-oriented, extremely regulated, and hypercompetitive skill set whose market clearing price is literally lower than zero. We’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-are-and-are-not-discount-brokerages&quot;&gt;Who are and are not discount brokerages?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good examples of discount brokerages include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schwab.com/&quot;&gt;Charles Schwab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdameritrade.com&quot;&gt;TD Ameritrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etrade.com&quot;&gt;E*Trade&lt;/a&gt;, and (arguably) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interactivebrokers.com&quot;&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m including Interactive Brokers mostly for comparison purposes. Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E*TRADE all basically target the same customer: mass affluent Baby Boomers. Interactive Brokers targets professional and semi-professional active traders but happens to expose just enough of a front-end at just comparable enough terms to look like a discount broker.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only places that do investing; they’re one particular part of one value chain which connects mass affluent Americans to the financial markets. Employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401ks are another; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fidelity.com/&quot;&gt;Fidelity Investments&lt;/a&gt;, the largest 401k administrator, also has a (very materially sized) retail-facing brokerage operation. So does &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.vanguard.com/home/&quot;&gt;Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, which is primarily a mutual fund provider. But since I’ve got to draw the line somewhere, and publicly traded ones are easier to get data on, I looked into those four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) aren’t discount brokers and yet have to be mentioned in a discussion of them. A RIA is, basically, an investment salesman who moonlights as an amateur psychologist with better math skills than most psychologists. They mostly charge a percentage of your net worth for amateur psychology, worksmanlike math, and non-expert-but-credentialed investing advice. The investment stores are happy to provide backend services to investment salesmen, because RIAs control a huge portion of the mass affluents’ investable assets. (There is an excellent, excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://investorfieldguide.com/kitces/&quot;&gt;podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; about how every product innovation in investing in the last 50 years is the answer to the questions “How do RIAs get paid?” and “How do RIAs justify their pay by providing more value-adding services than the last iteration?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the lot, there are fintechs like the robo-advisors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wealthfront.com/&quot;&gt;Wealthfront&lt;/a&gt; and the like), which replace the RIA’s human with a computer. Full-service brokerages still exist, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.com&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, which is a discount brokerage whose marketing and product decisions probably do not assist their users in achieving successful outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-discount-brokerages-make-money&quot;&gt;So how do discount brokerages make money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;net-interest&quot;&gt;Net interest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I were to give you $100, in return for your promise to give it back when I wanted it and pay me 0.27% annualized interest in the meanwhile. Suppose you invested this in a virtually riskless bond, perhaps a mortgage-backed security with government backing, offering 2.53% annualized interest. You’d earn $2.26 in net interest in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I were to give you $200 billion dollars. Now I’m the American middle class and you’re Charles Schwab. You would earn something like $5.8 billion dollars in net interest income. This would entirely pay for your sideline business in running a brokerage. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, branch offices, call centers, blah blah blah, it all exists to justify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/cash_solutions&quot;&gt;the only pricing page that matters&lt;/a&gt;, and all the verbiage on the pricing page is about how much &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; pay &lt;em&gt;the customer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an exaggeration, but not much of one. 57% of Schwab’s revenues are from net interest. The firm could literally give away every other service; discount the mutual fund fees to zero, do away with commissions, etc etc, and they would still be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab isn’t even the leader among discount brokerages in dependence on net interest. That would be E*TRADE, at about 67% of revenues. Interactive Brokers makes 49% and TD Ameritrade 51% in the segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You’ll come up with a different number if you cursorily skim TD Ameritrade’s annual report. They have an Insured Deposit Agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.td.com&quot;&gt;TD&lt;/a&gt;, the bank which owns them; TD kicks back $1.5 billion a year to be swept their client funds every night. “Sweeping” is a term of art by which money automatically leaves the brokerage accounts to rest peacefully on the balance sheet of a bank every night and then be back in the brokerage ready for the morning bell. The question of why a bank would happily pay billions of dollars for this is a fascinating digression into banking regulation and capital sufficiency ratios which this essay’s margins are too small to contain, but you can round it to “net interest income” and not be too wrong. All discount brokerages have a sweep available; how prominent they make the option and how they price it are product decisions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of financial history: E*TRADE nearly went bankrupt in 2007 due to having chased yield into writing mortgages and buying asset-backed securities, principally backed by subprime mortgages. These imploded, in a very public fashion, resulting in customers doubting E*TRADE’s ability to satisfy claims or continue operating the day-to-day brokerage business. They were saved by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citadel.com/&quot;&gt;Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, which is a large hedge fund that, by non-coincidence, is one of the internalizers that E*TRADE and the other brokerages use to access the public markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people get mad about the financial industry for taking advantage of customers. I find it hard to get mad about a deal between willing counterparties, but if you think that Wall Street is soaking the US middle class, you should be monomanically focused on the interest spread between cash balances in brokerage accounts and high-interest bank accounts or money market funds. That is &lt;strong&gt;the cost that does not call itself a cost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage customers keep ~10% of their assets in cash. The 200 basis point spread between cash in brokerage accounts and money market funds or insured bank accounts, &lt;em&gt;all of which are functionally riskless&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#riskless&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; , is equivalent to a 20 bps asset management fee across the portfolio. Vanguard’s flagship funds charge about 10 bps for wrapping the entire stock market, SPY (an ETF, which structurally has lower costs) does it for 4 bps, and people think the roboadvisors might be expensive doing similar for 25 bps on top of the underlying investments… and the discount brokerages charge effectively 20 bps over all your assets &lt;em&gt;just for managing the tiny portion that is in cash, the easiest asset to manage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead people get mad about payment for order flow, because nobody writes books about Interest Rate Spreads Are Just Too Darn High.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;commissions&quot;&gt;Commissions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally the “discount” in “discount brokerage” referred to commissions on trades, which are essentially a fee levied on successful API calls. In the bad old days of full-service brokerages, these were hundreds of dollars per trade. By the late 1990s the discount brokerages were doing them for tens of dollars; they’re currently single digit dollars and are destined for zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the current, briefly non-zero prices on your brokerage or comparison website of choice. The contribution to revenue across the discount brokerages is minimal: 6.8% at Schwab, 28% at TD Ameritrade, and 17% at E*TRADE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers is the one standout, largely because it caters to high-volume professional and semi-professional traders; it makes 49% of revenues on commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A name often mentioned by my acquaintances with respect to commissions is Robinhood, which decided to take the hundreds of millions of dollars that discount brokerages spend on ads every year and instead subsidize commissions straight to zero. This is both bold, disruptive innovation and &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; just an incremental extension of a pricing war which the larger brokerages have been engaged in for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to routinely shaving a buck or two off their list prices, Schwab is experimenting with zeroing commissions on their own ETFs. This realigns their revenue to the stocks (of money) rather than the flows, which makes the substantial majority of brokerage accounts that virtually never trade more lucrative and probably is better for investors (since “retail investors destroy value when trading” is about as citation-needed as “smoking causes lung cancer” at this point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero-commission trading is a game of cross-subsidy. Cross-subsidy isn’t bad, per se; one of the ways that financial services stay so affordable is by firms competing with different mixes of cross-subsidization and specializing on their target customer profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some larger financial firms are themselves opening up discount brokerages to use the subsidy to get greater share-of-assets and customer acquisition among desirable customers; Chase’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/you-invest/pricing&quot;&gt;YouInvest&lt;/a&gt; product basically exists as one leg of a stool to get millennial professionals to use a Chase Sapphire card with their Chase Sapphire banking. Several banks have tried this before: Bank of America uses Merrill Lynch (specifically their Merrill Edge product) in the same fashion, and Capital One tried (and failed) to do similar with their Sharebuilder acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-management&quot;&gt;Asset Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groceries are a famously low-margin business. One way to increase the margins is to vertically integrate: instead of selling branded Cheerios, you sell circular-shaped toasted whole grain cereal, and keep a portion of the money General Mills would have spent on advertising. You probably don’t actually &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; the cereal; you pay a specialist to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment stores are a famously low-margin business. One way to increase the margins is to vertically integrate: instead of selling branded… you get the general idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schwab is, of the discount brokerages, the oldest and the one which figured out the formula: use (historically) RIAs to hawk Schwab-branded mutual funds as opposed to other mutual funds, use the boatload of marketing fees that you’re now not paying to a 3rd party to underwrite the development of the rest of the store, and successfully nail multiple generational transitions in how the financial industry made money. (Can I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://investorfieldguide.com/kitces/&quot;&gt;that podcast&lt;/a&gt; again; it is a fantastic oral history of the financial advice industry and, by extension, Schwab.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab made 32% of its revenue doing asset management, including 18% for mutual fund/ETF management and another 11% for “advice solutions.” (Schwab takes approximately 50 bps of assets under management for providing the service of talking to a human who are licensed to recommend things from the investment store, as opposed to people who can take orders for things from the investment store.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TD Ameritrade earned about 10% for similar products, and E*TRADE about 3.8%. Interactive Brokers doesn’t have store-brand products and doesn’t appear to make a material amount of revenue from e.g. mutual fund marketing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;securities-lending&quot;&gt;Securities Lending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many technologists know how shorting stock works: you borrow a share of a stock from someone, sell it for money, and eventually repurchase and return the share, hoping to profit from the decline in price of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “borrow” is important and often glossed over in this explanation. Retail traders often get the stock they short loaned to them by their brokerage as a courtesy (cross-subsidization, again!), but institutional traders (shorting large blocks of stock for potentially long time horizons) or anyone shorting “hard to borrow” stocks has to pay for the privilege. Who gets paid? The person who has the stock to loan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that is the owner of the stock but… not always. A mutual fund, for example, might loan the attractive constituents of their portfolio to either increase returns or act as a less-transparent expense ratio. (Cross-subsidization, again!) Retail brokerages might loan out customer assets and just keep the fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://client.schwab.com/secure/file/P-5182696/MKT33373-05.pdf&quot;&gt;Schwab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibkr.info/article/1838&quot;&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/a&gt; both have opt-in programs where they’ll split the fee with the owner; IB explicitly splits it 50/50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most customers’ will not notice securities lending revenue; on a typical stock it might be 5 bps a year or less. (Across my portfolio, which is an unremarkable mix of ETFs and a few large-cap stocks, Interactive Brokers earns 14 bps and pays about 7.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers with concentrated positions in heavily-shorted stocks would hypothetically earn a lot if they were being paid for it. If, for example, one wanted the moral rectitude of a Bitcoin exchange combined with the clear-headed decisionmaking of smoking cannabis, one could hypothetically justify an investment in Aphria. Short sellers are presently willing to pay about 100% per year to short that stock… for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=aphria+short+seller+report&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better reason for a technologist to be long a stock a lot of people want to short is because they have earned it through services and, for whatever reason, not sold it. If you own a material amount of stock in a publicly traded technology company, particularly a material amount of stock which is not widely available at the moment, you should probably devote non-zero effort to understanding whether you’re allowed to loan that stock out and, if so, whether your brokerage will pay you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TD Ameritrade earned about 4.1% and E*TRADE earned 3.5% from securities lending. Schwab’s is upper bounded at 2.2%. Interactive Brokers was an outlier at about 9.7%. (These are all net of payments to clients; Schwab, notably, passes the fee revenue for their mutual funds to the fund shareholders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;payment-for-order-flow&quot;&gt;Payment for Order Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discount brokerages mostly (again, save Interactive Brokers) service retail clients. Retail clients almost by definition do not possess an informational edge on the market; they are buying stock because it is payday, because Jim Cramer shouted loudly, or because they love Apple products. They sell for similarly personal reasons. None of these is an edge by the standards of professional movers of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who buys or sells a financial asset pays for &lt;strong&gt;liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;; the ability to quickly and definitively close a transaction at a particular agreed upon price. Houses are notably low in liquidity and that liquidity is extremely expensive; it takes months of work to sell them and the gap between natural buyers and natural sellers is very high. Publicly listed large cap US equities have extremely good liquidity; the bid/ask spread is extremely narrow and you can buy or sell, by retail investor standards, any amount at either price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is on the public markets, but retail investors get a &lt;em&gt;better deal&lt;/em&gt; than the public markets. They get this deal from internalizers, who are something akin to an API gateway between the brokerages and the public markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s useful to understand that there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; public markets in the US and they don’t have the same order book; the prices can, in principle, momentarily differ from each other. One variant of high frequency trading exists to correct these momentary mispricings by arbitraging them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation NMS obligates brokers to route orders to the venue offering the best price. This is logistically challenging to determine in real time, and takes specialized technical systems and skill. The internalizers offer this product to the discount brokerages and pay the brokerages to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Suppose a hypothetical stock is trading at $10.01 by $10.02. This means that sophisticated marketmakers (mostly) are willing to buy it for $10.01 or sell it for $10.02; they are, at this instant in time, ambivalent which of those two transactions happens, because doing this hundreds of thousands of times a day will generally result in them earning half a penny per share (half the spread) while taking on some risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of the risk is that the price of the stock is not a pure random walk which can be statistically predicted. There is some underlying economic reality to it, and that economic reality can be perceived and acted upon by sophisticated people who don’t work for the marketmaker. This results in them being “run over”; a large order (or series of orders) can move the market away from the previously prevailing price, causing the marketmaker to have a position (which is something they want to minimize) which is now at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principally, these underlying economic realities will be perceived (or caused!) by well-capitalized, informed traders like hedge funds, mutual funds, Goldman Sachs’ proprietary trading operation, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The risk of adverse selection is priced into the cost of liquidity.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are making markets in public, where Goldman Sachs can trade with you, you have to quote a wide enough spread such that even with Goldman occasionally running you over, you still make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFTs, and other marketmakers, are good at this. They have to be; if they weren’t, they’d have gone out of business. It is a very competitive game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could somehow make markets without informed traders—if you were guaranteed that Goldman could never trade with you—your risk would be lower and you could, therefore, provider tighter spreads. There is a way to do this; it is to trade exclusively with retail traders. They &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; run over you; they don’t have the informational edge or the capital to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus internalizers make this offer to every discount broker: use us for execution. Most of your customers are indifferent to order routing; we’ll handle that hard work for you. For most of them, we’re going to make an instant decision to offer them &lt;em&gt;better execution than the public markets will give&lt;/em&gt;; we’ll pay $10.011 instead of $10.01, for example. We can’t offer them worse, because the SEC will detect that and fine us gazillions of dollars for the pennies we picked up on the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At scale, this is so lucrative and so riskless that, in addition rebating a bit of money to the retail investors, the internalizers pay their brokerages a commission. This is the “payment for order flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who read a lot about technology confuse this with buying the retail investor’s data. Citadel is one of the largest hedge funds in the world. Citadel does not run a machine learning algorithm on your neighbor’s GM trades in their IRA to inform their thinking of the true value of GM as a business. They can employ a team of rocket scientists to do that. The thing they buy vis your neighbor is &lt;em&gt;the opportunity to transact with him&lt;/em&gt;, because doing so is virtually riskless given their setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment for order flow is a minor footnote to the story of discount brokerages&lt;/strong&gt;, in the same fashion that HFT is basically irrelevant to retail traders except for decreasing their cost of trading by decimating spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab earned 1.4% of revenue from payment for order flow, TD Ameritrade about 8.4%, and E*TRADE about 6.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers has historically been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=44074#section-pfof-drop&quot;&gt;quite reticent&lt;/a&gt; about participating in internalization, because it doesn’t play well with their sophisticated clients; they earn about 1.1% from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major reason for the dispersion here is that some spreads are wider than others and, all else equal, you’d pay more to own a toll booth to risklessly collect a wider spread. Spreads on options are higher than that for equities and options trades are generally larger (one contract represents 100 shares and a trade may involve 2~4 legs with N contracts each). Options marketmakers thus pay more than equity internalizers on a per-trade basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute amounts involved on a per-trade basis are peanuts: 9.7 cents (!) for Interactive Brokers to about $2.50 per trade for the other three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Robinhood earns more than the discount brokerages for order flow is readily apparent: their product encourages options trading. This is bad for customers, principally because the supermajority of Robinhood customers do not understand options trading and the risk/reward calculus for them is even more borked than it is for the vast majority of people who engage in it. The options trades they engage in are also less liquid, and so have higher spreads, and so are more lucrative for marketmakers, but the thing you should be most concerned with is their product decisions which encourage options trading, not with the price of liquidity on those options trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Indeed, while marketmaking for Robinhood options trades seems like a license to print money, a quick perusal of /r/wallstreetbets makes me wonder whether &lt;em&gt;taking the other side of all Robinhood trades&lt;/em&gt; would be even better. I’m joking but I’m not sure how much I’m joking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlines like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders&quot;&gt;Robinhood Gets Almost Half Its Revenue in Controversial Bargain With High-Speed Traders&lt;/a&gt; are virtually meaningless, as the above discussion of other monetization options should make clear. At scale, once their userbase actually has material cash in their accounts on any given day, they’ll likely make net interest, but pre-scale they may not even have the treasury function to do the work required to earn it safely. It’s a commentary on how low their revenue is (growth-stage startup optimizing for reach over revenue, film at 11), not a commentary on how beholden they are to Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;did-anything-useful-come-out-of-this-research-project&quot;&gt;Did anything useful come out of this research project?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things that I believe much more strongly than I did previously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commissions in discount brokerages will go to zero.&lt;/strong&gt; Like most repricing, it will continue to be slow until it happens all at once. Interactive Brokers will likely still continue charging them, as it is least similar in character to the rest of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roboadvisors are a bad business below scale.&lt;/strong&gt; I have really liked the model as a user, but I am glad I’m an investor using a roboadvisor rather than an investor in a roboadvisor. The discount brokerage industry works because you can make decisions which are bad for users and lucrative for you (“Ahh you have entrusted me with cash money; let me park it safely and pay you 50 bps while keeping the next 150 bps for me, rather than parking it in the equally safe place any of my product managers could have implemented if they wanted to be fired instantly”); roboadvisors depend on making decisions which are good for users (“Let me minimize that cash drag for you”) and then being very explicit about costs which are anchored &lt;em&gt;very low.&lt;/em&gt; (Again, hate to belabor a point, but Wealthfront charges 25 bps all-in (on top of the underlying ETFs) and every customer knows it; Schwab charges 18 bps for &lt;em&gt;cash management alone&lt;/em&gt; and virtually no customer has ever even thought there could be a number there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some technologists I am acquainted with should know one esoteric thing about equities markets.&lt;/strong&gt; If you own a material amount of a publicly traded stock, and the supply of that stock is constrained, and some population of sophisticated people want to short it, maybe you should Charge More rather than letting your broker get that service from you for free. Speak to your trusted advisor, this can have fairly toothy consequences, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-reading&quot;&gt;More reading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put more effort into the math than I generally do for blog posts, but it’s entirely possible that I fumble-fingered something. Feel free to reproduce it. All of the above is exhaustively covered in public filings, principally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good magic word to know is “SEC Rule 606” if you ever want to know which internalizers are getting order flow, probably because you or someone you love is wrong on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I value my reputation as an honest broker (ba dum bum) a lot more than my extremely attenuated ability to influence peoples’ financial decisions, but for what it is worth: I do not have a material exposure to any company mentioned and don’t use affiliate links. My family uses Wealthfront and Interactive Brokers, mostly because &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/investing-for-geeks&quot;&gt;retail investors should mostly not pick stocks&lt;/a&gt; and this setup is relatively amenable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interactivebrokers.co.jp/jp/?f=13416&quot;&gt;Americans living abroad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#footnote-0&quot;&gt;[0]&lt;/a&gt;: Michael Lewis wrote a book so bad about the microstructure of securities markets that it Someone Is Wrong On The Internet’ed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P0QI2M2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; into being. You should read that one; it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#footnote-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;: This is a term of art thrown around in financial services and marketing generally. It corresponds to roughly 30% of the US population, basically those with financial assets above $100k or who are, due to strong income, are certain to get there soonish. The bottom 50% of the US by wealth largely doesn’t own brokerage accounts; the folks who are between those two markers are largely &lt;em&gt;unprofitable&lt;/em&gt; accounts for the industry to service, but brokerages (and banks) have gotten reasonably good at playing the &lt;em&gt;very long game&lt;/em&gt; about cost of customer acquisition and cohort math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/#footnote-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;: Anticipating an HN comment: “Brokerage accounts, money market funds, and bank accounts are not functionally riskless.” There’s a long and boring answer about SIPC versus FDIC insurance, the mechanics of Schwab and Interactive Brokers striping deposits across multiple banks to 4~10X dip on deposit insurance, and the implicit guarantee of money market funds in the wake of 2008 to avoid market contagion, but the short version is “I still think I’m right.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;President Trump on Monday pushed for greater price disclosure in health care, signing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-issue-executive-order-on-health-care-price-transparency-11561051500?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that could make thousands of hospitals expose more pricing information and require doctors, health clinics and others to tell patients about out-of-pocket costs upfront.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;While President Trump has pledged repeatedly to take on health costs, the signing of the executive order unleashes coordinated efforts from multiple agencies to pursue the goal. It calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a rule within two months that could require hospitals to publicize information on their negotiated rates with insurers for common procedures.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;In comments Monday at the White House, Mr. Trump said the order would fundamentally change the health-care marketplace. “There’s frankly no rhyme or reason for what’s been happening for so many years,” he said, adding that the “lack of price transparency has enriched industry giants greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    

      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Industry groups are mobilizing to fight back, saying any requirement that hospitals and insurers disclose negotiated rates would go too far. Lawsuits could be likely, meaning any action could be delayed until after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-mounts-new-push-on-health-care-ahead-of-2020-election-11561123548?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. They also said the order lacks many specifics, raising questions about how aggressive the administration will actually be in exposing the murky realm of health-care pricing.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“This effort is all about 2020,” said Tom Nickels,  executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, which opposes the plan. “This is their effort to come up with a health-care agenda for 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;President Trump’s order reflects a deeper worry over the escalating cost of health care animating voters and shaping the presidential election. More than two-thirds of people say that reducing health-care costs should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year, according to a January survey by the Pew Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Democrats and Republicans are clashing over solutions. Democratic presidential candidates want to expand the federal government’s role in health care as a way to keep a thumb on prices. President Trump’s executive order stems from the belief that exposing rates will turbocharge a free market, enabling competition to drive down costs.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Some action could come soon because the administration is already working on two unrelated rules that deal with pricing. HHS is expected in July to release a hospital payment rule that may include price-disclosure requirements, and a separate health-information rule could also require rates to be publicly shared. Either regulation could become a tool for delivering on the order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;The administration has said patients should know how much they are going to pay and how much hospitals get for providing care. Its goal is to enable consumers to make health-care decisions with clear pricing and information on the quality of services.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt; Seema Verma,  administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Mr. Trump wanted to go beyond just having hospitals post their list prices. That requirement went into effect this year and doesn’t force the disclosure of discounted rates paid by insurers.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“We really want to make sure it’s meaningful,” she said Monday in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The proposed rule to force hospital-rate disclosures with insurers would target hospitals and doctors employed by them. The order says the coming regulation would require hospitals to publicly post “information based on negotiated rates” for common services. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But the order doesn’t say if hospitals would have to disclose the average of all rates they get from insurers or the specific rate they get from an individual’s insurer. That detail matters: The average rates would have a milder effect on local markets as insurers and hospitals still wouldn’t get clarity on rivals’ specific secret rates.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Some health analysts said exposing rates could reveal more information about costs and actually fuel support for Medicare for All, a goal backed by some Democratic presidential candidates that would set upper limits on hospital reimbursements. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Another possible consequence is that hospitals might ask for more from an insurer to match what rivals are getting, which could ultimately drive up health costs.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Requiring price disclosure for thousands of hospital items, services and procedures perpetuates the old days of the American health-care system paying for volume over value,” Matt Eyles,  chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for the industry. “We know that is a formula for higher costs and worse care for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But the order could provide more clarity for millions of consumers. In addition to a rule on hospital prices, the order requires federal agencies in 90 days to pursue a plan for requiring providers and insurers to give patients upfront, out-of-pocket cost information. It is possible any rule would permit providers to provide estimates, and many insurers already offer this information through various health-cost calculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former head of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee (BDAC) was sentenced to five years in prison for defrauding investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Ann Pierce was CEO of Quintillion, an Alaskan telecom company, when she lied to two investment firms in New York in order to raise $270 million to build a fiber network. She also defrauded two individual investors out of $365,000 and used a large chunk of that money for personal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierce, 55, pleaded guilty and last week was given the five-year prison sentence in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ceo-alaska-based-fiber-optic-cable-company-sentenced-5-years-prison-defrauding&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. Pierce was also &quot;ordered to forfeit $896,698.00 and all of her interests in Quintillion and a property in Texas.&quot; She will also be subject to a restitution order to compensate her victims &quot;at a later date.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pierce's industry experience helped her land the top spot on Pai's broadband advisory committee in April 2017. But she left Quintillion in July 2017 as her scheme unraveled, and she resigned from the FCC advisory panel. Pai &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.fcc.gov%2Fedocs_public%2Fattachmatch%2FDA-17-834A1.docx&quot;&gt;appointed a new chair&lt;/a&gt; for his committee two months later; he thanked Pierce for her service, saying she did &quot;an excellent job&quot; chairing the committee and &quot;wish[ed] her all the best in her future endeavors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pierce used fake contracts to fool investors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berman's announcement detailed Pierce's fraud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between May 2015 and July 2017, Pierce engaged in a scheme to induce two New York-based investment companies to provide more than $270 million to construct the Quintillion System by providing them with eight forged broadband capacity sales contracts and related order forms under which Quintillion would obtain guaranteed revenue once the Quintillion System was built (the &quot;Fake Revenue Agreements&quot;). Under the Fake Revenue Agreements, four telecommunications services companies appeared to have made binding commitments to purchase specific wholesale quantities of capacity from Quintillion at specified prices. The cumulative value of the Fake Revenue Agreements was approximately $1 billion over the life of the Fake Revenue Agreements. In reality, the Fake Revenue Agreements were completely worthless because Pierce had forged the counterparties' signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these revenue agreements &quot;never existed at all,&quot; and &quot;others were falsified versions of genuine revenue agreements.&quot; Pierce altered the contracts &quot;to make them more favorable to Quintillion and, therefore, more appealing to investors than the genuine agreements,&quot; the US Attorney's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, under one of the Fake Revenue Agreements, the customer purportedly agreed to buy from Quintillion increasing quantities of gigabits per second of capacity over a period of 20 years,&quot; the US Attorney said. &quot;That agreement, if genuine, would have assured Quintillion hundreds of millions of dollars in future revenue. In reality, negotiations over that deal had ended unsuccessfully, a fact that Pierce never disclosed to the investors. Under another Fake Revenue Agreement, the customer purportedly agreed to buy a fixed, predetermined amount of capacity from Quintillion regardless of subsequent market conditions. In truth, that customer was not obligated to buy any capacity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierce tried to cover up her fraud &quot;by continuing to negotiate with the telecommunications companies in hopes of reaching agreements identical to the ones she forged&quot; but failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pierce hid these genuine, but inferior, contracts from the investment companies and her own staff,&quot; the US Attorney's office said. &quot;When Quintillion and the investment companies ultimately discovered the fraud in mid-2017, they learned that the real contracts Pierce actually negotiated would generate only a fraction of the anticipated guaranteed revenue of the Fake Revenue Agreements she forged.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierce convinced the two individual investors that they would receive ownership interests in Quintillion in exchange for their $365,000, when in reality they received no shares in the company. Pierce &quot;used half of one victim's money and all of the other victim's investment for her own personal benefit,&quot; the US Attorney's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quintillion said it &quot;took swift action and self-reported to the Department of Justice&quot; when it learned of Pierce's fraud, the company &lt;a href=&quot;http://qexpressnet.com/press-release-quintillion-statement-regarding-federal-charges-against-former-ceo/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FCC committee favors industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC committee that Pierce used to lead has repeatedly been criticized for favoring the interests of industry over the public at large. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/fcc-broadband-committee-wants-to-restrict-publicly-owned-networks/&quot;&gt;quit the group&lt;/a&gt; in January 2018 out of frustration that its recommendations favor the interests of private industry over municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee has also pushed policy that would benefit telecom companies at the expense of other tech companies. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/12/fcc-panel-wants-to-tax-internet-using-businesses-and-give-the-money-to-isps/&quot;&gt;December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the committee urged states to impose new taxes on Netflix, Google, Facebook, and many other businesses that require Internet access to operate. The resulting funding would have been transferred to ISPs via grants that subsidize private broadband providers' network construction. (Pai didn't back the tax proposal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BDAC is continuing its work, with the FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2019/06/broadband-deployment-advisory-committee-meeting&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; it will &quot;craft recommendations for the Commission on ways to accelerate the deployment of high-speed Internet access... by reducing and/or removing regulatory barriers to infrastructure investment and strengthening existing broadband networks in communities across the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April this year, Pai &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/fcc-consumer-advisory-panel-includes-alec-big-foe-of-municipal-broadband/&quot;&gt;gave a consumer advisory committee spot&lt;/a&gt; to a representative of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which lobbies against municipal broadband, net neutrality, and other consumer protection measures. (&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story originally stated incorrectly that an ALEC representative is a member of the FCC's Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee. The consumer advisory committee is separate from the BDAC.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook, Libra, and the Long Game</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When I get things wrong — and I was very much wrong about Facebook’s blockchain plans — the reason is usually a predictable one: confirmation bias. That is, I already have an idea of what a company’s motivations are, and then view news through that lens, failing to think critically about what parts of that news might actually disconfirm my assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was last month when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-building-cryptocurrency-based-payments-system-11556837547&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal reported&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook was building a cryptocurrency-based payment system. I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-cryptocurrency-the-problem-and-benefit-of-credit-cards-the-facebook-payment-network/&quot;&gt;Daily Update&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the obvious: this isn’t a Bitcoin competitor. And why would it be? The entire point of Bitcoin is to be distributed; Facebook’s power come from its centralization. Indeed, this is probably the single most important prism through which to examine whatever it is that Facebook does in the space: the company is not going betray its dominant position, but rather seek to strengthen it. That is why I am not too concerned about not knowing the implementation details: take it as a given that whatever role users have to play in this network, Facebook will have final control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand by the first part of that excerpt: for all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ambitious-plan-behind-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra/&quot;&gt;the positive attributes&lt;/a&gt; Facebook is highlighting about Project Libra — which Facebook, in conjunction with the newly formed &lt;a href=&quot;https://libra.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;Libra Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-unveils-crypto-wallet-based-on-currency-libra-11560850141&quot;&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt; — it is unreasonable to expect that Facebook would invest significant resources in something that would weaken its position. What I got wrong was presuming that meant overt Facebook control. Frustratingly, it was an error that should have both been obvious in my original analysis and also clear in the broader view of the Internet I have explained through &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is Libra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libra is being presented as a cryptocurrency based on a blockchain: transactions are recorded on a shared ledger and verified by “miners” independently solving cryptographic problems and arriving at a consensus that the transaction is legitimate and should be added to the ledger permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, it is much more complicated: while a limited set of “validators” — aka miners — share a history of transactions in (individual) blocks that are chained together (i.e. a blockchain), what Libra actually exposes is the current state of the ledger. In practice this means that adding new transactions can be much quicker and more efficient — more akin to adding a line to a spreadsheet than rebuilding the entire spreadsheet from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is a trade-off between trust and efficiency: whereas anyone can “rebuild the spreadsheet” in the case of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, where the blockchain is fully exposed, normal users have to trust Libra’s validators.&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/#footnote_0_4249&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_4249&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;To clarify, this roadmap on the Libra developers blog includes plans to allow anyone to “rebuild the spreadsheet”: Validator APIs to support full nodes (nodes that have a full replica of the blockchain but do not participate in consensus). This feature allows for the creation of replicas that can support scaling access to the blockchain and the auditing of the correct execution of transactions. However, only validators can actually validate transactions (unlike Bitcoin where anyone can be a miner/validator) &quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, Bitcoin, thanks to the overhead of communicating and verifying every transaction, can only manage around 7 transactions a second; Libra is promising 1,000 transactions per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Validators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, then, are the validators? Well, Facebook is one, but only one: currently there are 28 “Founding Members”, including merchants, venture capitalists, and payment networks, that meet two of the following three criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than $1 billion USD in market value or more than $500 million USD in customer cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach more than 20 million people a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition as a top-100 industry leader by a third-party association such as Fortune or S&amp;amp;P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “Founding Members” are required to make a minimum investment of $10 million and provide computing power to the network. In addition, there are separate requirements for non-profit organizations and academic institutions that rely on a mixture of budget, track record, and rankings; a minimum investment may not be necessary. Libra intends to have 100 Founding Members by the time it launches next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the important thing to understand about the Libra Association: while its members — who again, are the validators — do control the Libra protocol, Facebook does not control the validators. Which, by extension, means that Facebook will not control Libra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Libra Versus a Facebook Coin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the distinction, consider an alternative route that Facebook could have taken: a so-called “Facebook Coin”. In that case Facebook would have had total control over the protocol, and to be sure, this would have distinct advantages for Facebook specifically and the usability of a “Facebook Coin” generally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Efficiency and scalability would be maximized because Facebook could coordinate perfectly with itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development would be significantly accelerated because Facebook would not have to achieve consensus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook would have perfect knowledge of all transactions on the system because it would control all entry points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Trust-Efficiency tradeoff taken to the opposite extreme from Bitcoin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A theoretical Facebook Coin would be the opposite of Bitcoin&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4250&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-840x630.jpeg 840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Bitcoin, there is no need to trust anyone — you can verify the entire blockchain yourself — but at the cost of efficiency of transactions. A Facebook Coin, on the other hand, would require complete trust of Facebook, but transactions would be far more efficient as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious example of this is WeChat Pay: WeChat handles the transactions, stores the money, and is the sole source of authority about who owns what, and thanks to the ubiquity of WeChat and the efficiency of this model, WeChat Pay (along with Alipay) has become the default payment mechanism in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, WeChat doesn’t use any sort of blockchain-based technology. Why would it? The entire point of a blockchain is to distribute a ledger across multiple parties, which is fundamentally less efficient than simply storing the entire ledger in a single database managed by one party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Trust Versus Efficiency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets at the error in analysis I referenced above: because I was anchored on the idea of Facebook capturing transaction data, I missed that when the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Facebook was using some sort of blockchain technology (leaving aside the quibble on the definition noted above) it was an obvious signal that whatever Facebook was announcing would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be completely controlled by Facebook, because if the goal were Facebook control of a Facebook Coin then a blockchain would be a silly way to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A decentralized blockchain versus a centralized database&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4253&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-840x630.jpeg 840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to understand Libra, then, is as a sort of distributed ledger that is a compromise between a fully public blockchain and an internal database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A distributed ledger as a compromise between a decentralized blockchain and a centralized database&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4252&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-840x630.jpeg 840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the overall system is much more efficient than Bitcoin, while the necessary level of trust is spread out to multiple entities, not one single company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin versus Libra versus a theoretical Facebook coin&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4251&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-840x630.jpeg 840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-off is that Libra is not fully permissionless, although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/&quot;&gt;Libra White Paper&lt;/a&gt; does say that is the long-term goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that Libra is truly open and always operates in the best interest of its users, our ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless. The challenge is that as of today we do not believe that there is a proven solution that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network. One of the association’s directives will be to work with the community to research and implement this transition, which will begin within five years of the public launch of the Libra Blockchain and ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if this is possible: if you flip the “trust” axis in the above graphs the current state of affairs looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Is there an efficiency frontier when it comes to no-trust and efficiency?&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4254&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-840x630.jpeg 840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may very well prove to be the case that there is a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier&quot;&gt;efficient frontier&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to “no-trust” versus “efficiency”: that is, any decrease in necessary trust requires a corresponding decrease in efficiency. From my perspective the safest assumption about Libra’s future is that efficiency will be the ultimate priority, which means that the more that Libra is used the more difficult it will be to ever transition to a permission-less model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Credit Card Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even if Libra remains controlled by an ever-expanding-but-still-limited set of validators, that is likely to be a far easier “sale” than a Facebook Coin controlled by a single company. Leaving aside the fact Facebook is not exactly swimming in trust these days when it comes to users, why would any other large company want to adopt a currency with a single point of corporate control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the situation in the United States and other developed countries is much different than China: credit cards have their flaws, particularly in terms of fees, but they are widely accepted by merchants and widely used by consumers. China, on the other hand, mostly leapfrogged credit cards entirely; this meant that WeChat Pay’s (and Alipay’s) competition was cash: in that case the relative advantages of WeChat Pay relative to cash (which are massive) could overcome any concerns around centralized control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical Facebook Coin’s relative advantage to credit cards, on the other hand, would be massively smaller, which means obstacles to widespread adoption — like trusting Facebook exclusively — would likely be insurmountable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How new payment systems are — or are not — adopted&quot; width=&quot;2309&quot; height=&quot;1466&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4179&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg 2309w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-300x190.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-768x488.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-992x630.jpg 992w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2309px) 100vw, 2309px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the federation of trust inherent in Libra, despite the loss of efficiency that entails: by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being in control, and by actively including corporations like Spotify and Uber that will provide places to use Libra outside of Facebook, and payment networks like Visa and PayPal that will facilitate such usage, Facebook is increasing the chances that Libra will actually be used instead of credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggregation and the Long Game&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it is overly cynical to completely dismiss the advertised benefits of Libra: remittances, for example, have been the go-to example of how cryptocurrencies can have societal benefit for a long time for a very good reason — the current system exacts major fees from the population that can least afford to bear them. And, while I just spent an entire section on credit cards, the reality is that credit card penetration is much lower amongst the poor in developed countries and in developing countries generally: a digital currency ultimately premised on owning a smartphone has the potential to significantly expand markets to the benefits of both consumers and service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, Libra has the potential to significantly decrease friction when it comes to the movement of money; of course this potential is hardly limited to Libra — the reduction in friction is one of the selling points of digital currencies generally — but by virtue of being supported by Facebook, particularly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/06/coming-in-2020-calibra/&quot;&gt;Calibra wallet&lt;/a&gt; that will be both a standalone app and also built into Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, accessing Libra will likely be much simpler than accessing other cryptocurrencies. When it comes to decreasing friction, simplifying the user experience matters just as much as eliminating intermediary institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also another component of trust beyond caring about who is verifying transactions: confidence that the value of Libra will be stable. This is the reason why Libra will have a fully-funded reserve denominated in a basket of currencies. This does not foreclose Libra becoming a fully standalone currency in the long run, but for now both users and merchants will be able to trust that the value of Libra will be sufficiently stable to use it for transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of these bets pay off — that users and merchants will trust a consortium more than Facebook; that Libra will be cheaper and easier to use, more accessible, and more flexible than credit cards; and that Libra itself will be a reliable store of value — than that decrease in friction will be realized at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is when this bet would pay off for Facebook (and the second point I missed in my earlier analysis): the implication that digital currencies will do for money what the Internet did for information is that the very long-term trend will be towards centralization around Aggregators. When there is no friction, control shifts &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/goodbye-gatekeepers/&quot;&gt;from gatekeepers&lt;/a&gt; controlling supply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregators controlling demand&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, by pioneering Libra, building what will almost certainly be the first wallet for the currency, and bringing to bear its unmatched network for facilitating payments, Facebook is betting it will offer the best experience for digital currency flows, giving it power not by controlling Libra but rather by controlling the most users of Libra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will It Work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libra’s success, if it comes, will likely proceed in stages, with different challenges and competitors at each stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initially the most obvious use case for Facebook’s Calibra wallet application will be peer-to-peer payments, which means the competitor will be applications like PayPal’s Venmo. Here Facebook’s biggest advantage will be leveraging its network and messaging applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second use case will be using Libra to transact with merchants, who stand to benefit both from reduced fees relative to credit cards as well as larger addressable markets (i.e. potential users who don’t have credit cards). Note that none of Libra’s Founding Members are banks, which impose the largest percentage of credit card fees; Visa and Mastercard, on the other hand, are, like PayPal, happy to sit on top of Libra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest leap will come last: Libra as a genuine currency, not simply a medium for transaction. This will be a function of volume in the previous two use cases, and is understandably concerning to governments all over the world. This, though, is another advantage of Facebook giving up direct control of Libra: while regulators will be able to limit wallets like Calibra (which will fully abide by Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering regulations), Libra — particularly if it achieves a fully permission-less-model — would be much more difficult to control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how Facebook, given its size, would thrive in that final state, for the reasons I detailed above. Just as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asymco/status/417647326665400321/photo/1&quot;&gt;Google long boasted&lt;/a&gt; that the more people use the Internet the more revenue Google generates, it stands to reason that the more people use digital money the more it would benefit dominant digital companies like Facebook, whether that be through advertising, transactions, or simply making networks that much more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is also a reason to be skeptical: the idea of Google making more money by people using the Internet more was once viewed as a happy alignment of incentives that justified Google’s services being free; today the centralization — and thus money-making potential — that follows a reduction in friction is much better understood, and there is much more concern about just how much power these Aggregators have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly the case with Facebook: despite all of the company’s efforts to design a system that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; entail trusting Facebook exclusively — again, this is not a Facebook Coin — Libra is already widely known as a Facebook initiative. Unless the consumer benefits are truly extraordinary, that may be enough to prevent Libra from ever gaining escape velocity. This applies even more to the Calibra wallet: Facebook promises not to mix transaction data with profile data, but that entails, well, trust that Facebook may have already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn’t mean digital currencies will never make it: I do think that Libra gets closer to a workable balance between trust and efficiency than Bitcoin, at least when it comes to being usable for transactions and not simply a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/tulips-myths-and-cryptocurrencies/&quot;&gt;store of value&lt;/a&gt;; the question is who can actually get such a currency off the ground. Certainly Facebook’s audacity and ambition should not be underestimated, and the company’s network is the biggest reason to believe Libra will work; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s brand&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest reason to believe it will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_4249&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;To clarify, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.libra.org/blog/2019/06/18/the-path-forward&quot;&gt;this roadmap on the Libra developers blog&lt;/a&gt; includes plans to allow anyone to “rebuild the spreadsheet”:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validator APIs to support full nodes (nodes that have a full replica of the blockchain but do not participate in consensus). This feature allows for the creation of replicas that can support scaling access to the blockchain and the auditing of the correct execution of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, only validators can actually validate transactions (unlike Bitcoin where anyone can be a miner/validator) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/#identifier_0_4249&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<og:description>Libra is less about an immediate benefit to Facebook, and more about creating a world where companies like Facebook have the best chance to prosper. That is why Facebook gave up so much control.</og:description>

<title>Doing work locally minimizes problems with Electron apps</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jlongster.com/secret-of-good-electron-apps</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 25, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people really hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; apps. The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; that an app includes an entire copy of the Chrome web browser sounds ridiculous. This feeling is validated when looking at the apps on your machine — they eat up memory, boot slowly, and aren't very responsive. It's hard enough to build good apps on web, why the heck are we &lt;em&gt;bringing the web to desktop&lt;/em&gt; and causing even more problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't spend time arguing for Electron, but the incentives are obviously there given the success of it. We don't want to accept Electron's bloat though. Can we have our cake and eat it too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Electron's problems (large file size, slower boot up time) are inherent in the architecture and need to be solved at a lower-level. The bigger problems (memory hungry and sluggish) can be managed in user-land, but it takes a lot of care to do so. What if I told you there's a secret that automatically minimizes these problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &quot;secret&quot; is to do the bulk of your work locally in a background process&lt;/strong&gt;. The less you rely on the cloud, and the more powerful you make your background process, the more you can reap these benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data loads instantly.&lt;/strong&gt; You never have to wait for data to load over the network, it loads from a local data source instead. That right there will be a huge speed increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little need for caching.&lt;/strong&gt; Since all your data is available instantly, the client doesn't have to be concerned about caching so much. Usually web apps need to build up a lot of local state in order to have good performance, and this is one source of memory bloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ignores other benefits like your app working when offline, but that's for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://actualbudget.com/&quot;&gt;Actual&lt;/a&gt;, a personal finance manager. It's 100% local, and syncing across devices is an optional feature that happens on the side. For a data-heavy app, the results speak for themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/546db410-8c76-44bb-9d03-40fc81ea8667.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a total of 239.1MB of memory when the app is resting (it will go up depending on the page, but this is the baseline). Still not ideal, but not too bad either. That's better than the 1371MB that Slack is current taking up on my machine. Slack is an outlier though, and Electron gets too much flack for its specific problems. Other apps like Notion and Airtable sit around 400-600MB, so we're still beating that by a good bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that's before I've really optimized anything.&lt;/strong&gt; I plan on rewriting one of the critical and memory-intensive pieces in Rust which should significantly reduce memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background server can optimize its memory usage by only loading the appropriate data into memory as needed. The best thing to do is to use something like SQLite which is already highly optimized for this sort of stuff (seriously, just use SQLite). Moving things into the background process also frees up the UI to be as responsive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also turns that that &lt;strong&gt;using a background server in Electron also provides an extraordinary developer experience&lt;/strong&gt;. See the next section for all the crazy things you're allowed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your app is heavily web-based, you might need a background process if you need access to node APIs. It's the only place where it's safe to access them. This project will still be helpful to you to learn how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing electron-with-server-example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to encourage people to create truly local Electron apps, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example&quot;&gt;electron-with-server-example&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how to set all this up. This is the project I wish existed when I was starting with Electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical details are documented in the README of the project. A high-level overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It creates a &lt;strong&gt;normal node process&lt;/strong&gt; to run the server in the background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;creates an IPC channel&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc&quot;&gt;node-ipc&lt;/a&gt; to communicate between the backend and the UI directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If in development mode, instead of running the server as a background process, it runs it &lt;strong&gt;inside another window for debugging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a second, what's with the last point? It runs the server inside a &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt; in development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/ef77cefd-5ba9-47cd-9ddc-0c13af66a9d5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right! Once I got the background process working, I realized that we have all of Chrome's developer tools sitting right there, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the ability to create a window with node integration. That makes it easy to load the node process inside a window instead of in the background, allowing full access to Chrome's developer tools for debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at all the cool stuff you can do now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use the fancy console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added logging inside &lt;code&gt;server-ipc.js&lt;/code&gt; to log all the requests and responses, and I can inspect them with the fancy console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-image border border-gray-100 rounded relative overflow-hidden&quot; data-width=&quot;1100&quot; data-height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/26e75354-f1eb-40ad-8d9f-e00150d2bcdb.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image-content hidden&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you can use the stepping debugger. It's not ground breaking, but it's nice that it's always there instead of having to go through the work of setting up the node inspector when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-image border border-gray-100 rounded relative overflow-hidden&quot; data-width=&quot;1100&quot; data-height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/fd8fb7a5-1fec-4363-924c-f63a6581c69c.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image-content hidden&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Profiling!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps my favorite feature&lt;/strong&gt; is that the stellar performance tools are always available just a click away. Easily profile any part of your backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-image border border-gray-100 rounded relative overflow-hidden&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot; data-height=&quot;445&quot; data-src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/fea42de1-3ac5-4510-963e-e96d816d00f7.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image-content hidden&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even &lt;strong&gt;profile the startup time&lt;/strong&gt; of your background process (which is probably the heaviest part of bootup) by simply starting the recording and reloading the window! Reloading will restart the server, which brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Restart the server with Cmd+R&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of my favorites is that since the server is running in the window, &lt;strong&gt;simply reloading the window will restart the server&lt;/strong&gt;! Cmd+R (or Ctrl+R if you are on Windows) will restart the server and there's no need to restart the frontend process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can make changes to the server, hit Cmd+R and you'll get the latest changes, no other work needed! &lt;strong&gt;The frontend will keep whatever state it's in&lt;/strong&gt; and you can keep working against the latest server. Kinda like hot-patching the server in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the below image, after I change some code I hit Cmd+R to refresh the server and continue using the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-image border border-gray-100 rounded relative overflow-hidden&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;509&quot; data-src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/0ee635ad-2c7f-4eee-8a3f-57b5d5831b64.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image-content hidden&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inspecting &amp;amp; hot-patching server live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I just add console logs or make tweaks and restart the server, but sometimes you're debugging something really tricky, and it would be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; helpful to dig into the current server state to see what's going on. Maybe even change a few things while the server is running to see how it effects the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the console, node's &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; is available! This means you can require any of your server modules and hack on them in the console. For example, to get the &lt;code&gt;server-handlers.js&lt;/code&gt; module, just do &lt;code&gt;let handlers = require('./server-handlers')&lt;/code&gt; in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's add some server state: a history of all the numbers passed to &lt;code&gt;make-factorial&lt;/code&gt; (real apps would have much more complicated server state):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;_history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'make-factorial'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;_history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prism-code language-js&quot;&gt;We can now inspect this in the console by requiring the module and then looking at &lt;code&gt;handlers._history&lt;/code&gt;. We can even replace the implementation of &lt;code&gt;make-factorial&lt;/code&gt; entirely at run-time!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-image border border-gray-100 rounded relative overflow-hidden&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;509&quot; data-src=&quot;https://jlongster.com/s/upload/5a716944-ea63-483b-9ba0-33a025206cd4.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image-content hidden&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example&quot;&gt;electron-with-server-example&lt;/a&gt; to read about the implementation details and see all the code for a backend server in Electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Visual Studio Code, you might be used to good integration of developer tools with a backend node server. While you could run the server separately yourself and tell Electron to connect to a process owned by VS Code, I find it much simpler to reuse Electron's developer tools which are already there. This also means you get to use whatever editor you like and you have full access to all the tools including the profiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been heavily using the above techniques over the last several years to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://actualbudget.com/&quot;&gt;Actual&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm very happy with it. It's probably the best node development experience I've ever done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also crucial that we start developing real local apps. All of the technology is there, we just have to care about it. This article focused on the tech benefits of using a backend server and developing a 100% local app, but it doesn't even go into other benefits like being available regardless of network connection. In the future I'll write more about this and how syncing works in &lt;a href=&quot;https://actualbudget.com/&quot;&gt;Actual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
