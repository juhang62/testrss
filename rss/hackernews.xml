<title>Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership</title>
<link>https://thetoolsweneed.com/privacy-is-just-the-first-step-the-goal-is-data-ownership/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thetoolsweneed.com/privacy-is-just-the-first-step-the-goal-is-data-ownership/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as you connect to the internet, there is a vast surveillance infrastructure tracking your every move. Even the most hackery of hackers have trouble moving in complete anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, however, our brains assume our pre-internet intuitions are still accurate. That what we do in our own home stays private until we decide otherwise. We feel violated when we discover how much is known about our online activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this level of surveillance is quickly taking over the physical world. Voice assistants listen to our conversations, our location can be determined by analyzing disruptions in our wifi signal, our phones track our every move. There are varying levels of difficulty to acquiring all of this data about us, but it's possible to get everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-is-a-problem&quot;&gt;Why This Is a Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech&quot;&gt;Leo Leporte on This Week in Tech&lt;/a&gt; every week, and his refrain to this concern is: &quot;So what? I've got nothing to hide.&quot; And his guests struggle to explain what the material consequence is to him. He says he gets cool products that improve his life and he doesn't care what these device makers know about him. Guests say it's creepy, that it's a slippery slope, etc. All stuff I agree with but it doesn't do much to address the skeptic's point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy for privacy's sake is a weak argument, and privacy advocates should abandon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real issue here is data ownership. A news story from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is freely accessible to anyone, and if someone takes that story and tries to make money off of it, we all acknowledge this is stealing. Yet if Facebook takes your words, location, and preferences and sells them, this is not (yet) considered theft. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well for one, there is no real way for you to monetize that data on your own, so it's hard to say a company stole X amount of money from you. Also, our limited understanding of the technical aspects of these products has led to us generally assuming that the tools generate the data, not us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-digital-orchard&quot;&gt;Your Digital Orchard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have an orchard of apple trees, but you yourself don't really have a use for apples. You just let them ripen and fall to the ground. But let's also say, for some reason all your friends are really interested in the status of your apples. They like to compare them to their apples. They feel like this is a way they can stay in touch with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a new company called Applebook comes to your house. Applebook says, &quot;Hey, your friends Joe and Jane sent me over here to show you their apples. Want us to take yours over to show them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say. &quot;That'll save me the trouble.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Great,&quot; says Applebook. &quot;We'll let you know what they think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applebook provides a great service to the neighborhood. Everyone enjoys knowing how everyone else's apples are doing. What they look like, how theirs compare. The best part is, Applebook is absolutely free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Applebook has a growing warehouse of apples. Once they're done showing everyone the apples, they put them in their warehouse. Not only that, but they have a bunch of apple buyers who regularly back their trucks up to the warehouse and take tons of apples away to use them however they wish. Applebook is raking in the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applebook regularly drops off fertilizer and new seeds to help you grow even more apples. Who in the neighborhood can grow the most? It's a fun competition. So fun, in fact, that people leave work during their lunch break to work on their orchard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News reports start coming out that Applebook's warehouse was robbed! Some of the neighborhood's apples are gone! We didn't realize Applebook was storing all our apples, we thought they just threw them away. And hey, it looks like Applebook is selling our apples and making gobs of money off of them. We didn't realize those apples are even worth anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about where we're at now with our data. In the above story, the act of theft is clear, but when the same thing happens with data, we're having a hard time calling it like it is. Just like produce grown on your land, the data that we generate rightly belongs to you first, not the companies that collect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalent to privacy in this story would be opting out of Applebook, which takes care of one problem, but then we've just gone back to your apples going to waste, unused. Their value has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-just-the-beginning&quot;&gt;This Is Just the Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To belabor the metaphor even more, apples are not the only thing we grow. We have tons of data trees bearing fruit that just falls to the ground uncollected and un-monetized. Health data, biometrics, DNA, thoughts and feelings, facial expressions, odors, etc. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Moonalice&quot;&gt;Roger McNamee&lt;/a&gt; put it on a recent Sam Harris podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://samharris.org/podcasts/152-trouble-facebook/&quot;&gt;&quot;The Problem With Facebook,&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  these data companies are like governments declaring eminant domain over your data and claiming it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't own our data if we're giving it away for free and without consent. Privacy tools are really just data protection tools so that you maintain ownership. What we don't have tools for is monetizing that data for an individual. That value still disappears when you increase your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could make the argument that it's better to let it be captured now so that it can be recovered later via a lawsuit. I'd prefer to stop the bleeding and start building ways to capture all that data in a way that gives me control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-possible-solution&quot;&gt;A Possible Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need is a digital locker that encrypts all our data and stores it for us. Then, if an app or company would like access to it, they would have to ask us directly. For that we would need a marketplace where potential customers for our data could browse our inventory and purchase what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the discussion is about privacy, but we need to move it forward to data ownership. That's the only way people who think they don't have anything to hide will really understand that they have something at stake. Only then will the market reward companies that build tools that facilitate the ownership and monetization of a user's data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ex-Mozilla CTO: I was grilled for three hours at US airport by border cops</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_border_patrol_search_demand_mozilla_cto/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_border_patrol_search_demand_mozilla_cto/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Former Mozilla CTO Andreas Gal says he was interrogated for three hours by America's border cops after arriving at San Francisco airport – because he refused to unlock his work laptop and phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal, now employed by Apple, today &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@andreasgal/no-one-should-have-to-travel-in-fear-b2bff4c460e5&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; he was detained and grilled on November 29 after landing in California following a trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had attempted to pass through US customs via a Global Entry electronic kiosk. He wasn't expecting a problem, since the Hungarian-born techie is now an American citizen, but it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;On this trip, the kiosk directed me to a Customs and Border Patrol agent who kept my passport and sent me to secondary inspection,&quot; Gal said. &quot;There I quickly found myself surrounded by three armed agents wearing bullet proof vests. They started to question me aggressively regarding my trip, my current employment, and my past work for Mozilla, a non-profit organization dedicated to open technology and online privacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal said the g-men were rather interested in his time at Firefox-maker Mozilla, and of his recent trip to Canada. They also went through his wallet and luggage, and this led to a request by the agents for Gal to unlock his Apple-issued iPhone XS and MacBook Pro so they could search it, it is claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the devices were emblazoned with big red stickers reading &quot;PROPERTY OF APPLE. PROPRIETARY,&quot; and he had signed confidentially agreements with Cupertino, Gal said he asked for permission to call his bosses and/or a lawyer to see if he would get into trouble by handing over access. When this request was repeatedly refused, we're told, he clammed up, taking the Fifth, and citing constitutional rights against unwarranted searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irked by Gal's refusal, it is claimed, the border agents told him he had no constitutional nor any legal protections, and threatened him with criminal charges should he not concede to the search. He said he was eventually allowed to leave with his belongings, the devices still locked, and no charges were pressed. Gal said the agents did take away his Global Entry pass, which allows express entry through customs, as punishment for not complying with their demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;How random is random?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal believes the ordeal was not a random search gone awry, but rather a targeted attempt by the government to send a message. Certainly more and more security researchers report being grilled by US border patrol, if they can even &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/05/rsa_cofounder_us_visa_row/&quot;&gt;get a visa&lt;/a&gt; to enter the country, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My past work on encryption and online privacy is well documented, and so is my disapproval of the Trump administration and my history of significant campaign contributions to Democratic candidates,&quot; Gal noted. &quot;I wonder whether these CBP [Customs and Border Patrol] programs led to me being targeted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/07/14/tsa_gloves.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;TSA gloves&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Customs officials will at least need 'reasonable suspicion' to slurp device contents&quot;&gt;US border cops told to stop copying people's files just for the hell of it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/05/us_customs_copying_files/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Gal has enlisted the help of the ACLU to probe into the brouhaha, and determine whether his civil rights were violated. The civil-liberties watchdog has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclunc.org/docs/ACLU-NC_2019-03-28_Letter_re._Electronic_Device_Search_SFO.pdf&quot;&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] with the Department of Homeland security to determine whether the search violated the US Constitution and demand an investigation of whether the CBP's entry policies are illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CBP's baseless detention and intrusive interrogation of Andreas Gal and the attempted search of his devices violated his Fourth Amendment rights,&quot; ACLU Northern California senior counsel William Freeman said of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Furthermore, CBP’s policies lack protections for First Amendment rights by allowing interrogation and device searches that may be based on a traveler’s political beliefs, activism, nation of origin, or identity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the border patrol told us: &quot;As a matter of policy, CBP can’t comment on pending litigation.&quot; ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why there’s so little left of the early internet</title>
<link>http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190401-why-theres-so-little-left-of-the-early-internet</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190401-why-theres-so-little-left-of-the-early-internet</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2005, student Alex Tew had a million-dollar brainwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20-year-old was playing around with ideas to pay for a looming three-year business degree; Tew was already worrying that the overdraft he had would mushroom. So he scribbled on a pad: “How to become a millionaire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later he had what he thought was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tew set up a website called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/&quot;&gt;Million Dollar Homepage&lt;/a&gt;. The site’s model was almost obscenely simple: on it was a million pixels of ad space, the pixels available to buy in blocks of 100 at $1 a pixel. Once you bought them they were yours forever. When the millionth pixel was sold, Tew would be a millionaire. At least, that was the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Million Dollar Homepage launched on 26 August 2005, after Tew had spent the grand sum of 50 euros on registering the domain and setting up the hosting. Advertisers bought pixels and provided a link, tiny image and a short amount of text for when the cursor hovered over their image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might also like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After little more than a month, thanks to word-of-mouth and ever-increasing media attention, Tew’s homepage had raised more than $250,000 (£140,000). In January 2006, the last 1,000 pixels were sold at auction for $38,100 (£21,500); Tew had indeed made his million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Million Dollar Homepage is still online, nearly a decade and a half after it was created. Many of the customers – which included the likes of the UK’s The Times newspaper, travel service Cheapflights.com, online portal Yahoo! and rock duo Tenacious D – have had 15 years of advertising off that one-off payment. The site still has several thousand viewers every day; it has probably been a very good investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tew, who now runs the meditation and mindfulness app Calm, indeed became a millionaire. But the homepage he created has also become something else: a living museum to an earlier internet era. Fifteen years may not seem a long time, but in terms of the internet it is like a geological age. Some 40% of the links on the Million Pixel Homepage now link to dead sites. Many of the others now point to entirely new domains, their original URL sold to new owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Million Dollar Homepage shows that the decay of this early period of the internet is almost invisible. In the offline world, the closing of, say, a local newspaper is often widely reported. But online sites die, often without fanfare, and the first inkling you may have that they are no longer there is when you click on a link to be met with a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a decade ago, I spent two years working on a rock music blog and on the music section of AOL, the sprawling internet pioneer now owned by US phone company Verizon. I edited or wrote hundreds of live reviews, music news stories, artists interviews and listicles. Facebook and Twitter were already massive audience drivers, and smartphones were connecting us to the Web between work and home; surfing the Web had become a round-the-clock activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Brewster Kahle hadn’t set up the Internet Archive and started saving things, without waiting for anyone’s permission, we’d have lost everything – Dame Wendy Hall &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could, quite reasonably, assume that if I ever needed to show proof of my time there it would only be a Google search away. But you’d be wrong. In April 2013, AOL abruptly closed down all its music sites – and the collective work of dozens of editors and hundreds of contributors over many years. Little of it remains, aside from a handful of articles saved by the Internet Archive, a San Francisco-based non-profit foundation set up in the late 1990s by computer engineer Brewster Kahle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most prominent of a clutch of organisations around the world trying to rescue some of the last vestiges of the first decade of humanity’s internet presence before it disappears completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dame Wendy Hall, the executive director of the Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, is unequivocal about the archive’s work: “If it wasn’t for them we wouldn’t have any” of the early material, she says. “If Brewster Kahle hadn’t set up the Internet Archive and started saving things – without waiting for anyone’s permission – we’d have lost everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dame Wendy says archives and national libraries had experience saving books, newspapers and periodicals because print had been around so long. But the arrival of the internet – and how quickly it became a mass form of communication and expression – may have taken them by surprise. The attempts to archive the internet have, in many areas, been playing catch-up ever since. “The British Library had to have a copy of every local newspaper published,” she says. As the newspapers have gone from print to the Web, the archiving takes a different form. Are these websites as vital a resource as the papers which preceded them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper archives are vulnerable, too, to being lost when the publications are closed down or merged with other titles. “Most newspapers, I imagine, will have some sort or archive,” she says. “But that can be lost unless it is archived properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who’s going to pay for it? We produce so much more material than we used to – Dame Wendy Hall &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major problem with trying to archive the internet is that it never sits still. Every minute – every second – more photos, blog posts, videos, news stories and comments are added to the pile. While digital storage has fallen drastically in price, archiving all this material still costs money. “Who’s going to pay for it?” asks Dame Wendy. “We produce so much more material than we used to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the role of digital conservation has partly fallen to the British Library. The library runs the UK Web Archive, which has been collecting websites by permission since 2004. The archive’s engagement manager Jason Webber says the problem is much bigger than most people realise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only the early material. Most of the internet is not being stored,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Internet Archive first started archives pages in 1996. That’s five years after the first webpages were set up. There’s nothing from that era that was ever copied from the live web.” Even the first web page set up in 1991 no longer exists; the page you can view on the World Wide Web Consortium is a copy made a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the first five years of the Web, much of the material published in Britain ended with the designation .ac.uk – academic articles written by academics. It was only in 1996 that the Web started seeing more general sites being set up, as commercial websites started outnumbering academic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;  I think there’s been very low level of awareness that anything is missing – Jason Webber &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Library does one “domain crawl” every year – saving anything that is published in the UK. “We try and get everything, but we do only do it once a year. But the cap for a lot of these sites is set at 500MB; that covers a lot of smaller sites, but you only have to have a few videos in there and that limit gets reached pretty quickly.” News websites like BBC News, however, do get crawled more often. The library, Webber says, has tried to build as complete picture as possible of events such as Brexit, the London 2012 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of World War One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s been very low level of awareness that anything is missing,” Webber says. “The digital world is very ephemeral, we look at our phones, the stuff on it changes and we don’t really think about it. But now people are becoming more aware of how much we might be losing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Webber says, the only material organisations have the right to gather is publicly viewable; an even bigger amount of culturally or historically important data is sitting on people’s archives, like their hard drives. But few of us are keeping those for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The British Library is full of letters between people. There are exchanges between politicians, or love letters, and these things are really important to some people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the material we post onto social networks as something that will always be there, just a click of a keyboard away. But the recent loss of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18271023/myspace-music-videos-deleted-2003-2015-server-migration&quot;&gt;12 years of music and photos&lt;/a&gt; on the pioneering social site MySpace – &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2006/07/11/myspace-americas-number-one/#TtJZHPUaS5q1&quot;&gt;once the most popular website in the US&lt;/a&gt; – shows that even material stored on the biggest of sites may not be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even Google's services are not immune. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47771927&quot;&gt;Google+, the search giant's attempt at a Facebook-rivalling social network&lt;/a&gt;, closed on 2 April. Did all its users back up the photos and memories they shared on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Putting your photos on Facebook is not archiving them, because one day Facebook won’t exist,” says Webber. If you have any doubt about the temporary nature of the Web, take a few minutes to trawl through the Million Dollar Homepage. It is the testament to how quickly our online past is fading away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another side to data loss. Dame Wendy points out that not archiving stories from news websites could lead to a selective view of history – new governments choosing not to save stories or archives which have cast them in a poor light, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The political is so often tied into the technical – Jane Winters &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as there’s a change of government, or restructuring of quangos, sites are closed down,” says Jane Winters, a professor of digital humanities at the University of London. “Or look at election campaigning sites, which by their nature are set up to be temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the sites that are lost echo even more seismic changes; the deaths and births of nations themselves. “It happened with Yugoslavia; .yu was the top-level domain for Yugoslavia, and that ended when it collapsed. There’s a researcher who is trying to rebuild what was there before the break-up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The political is so often tied into the technical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, perhaps, a slight silver lining. “I come from a history background, and we’ve always had to deal with gaps in the historical records, some of which we know about, and some we just have no idea about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dame Wendy Hall also sees parallels with the physical. When she was 15, in the late 1960s, she appeared as part of the audience in a taping of the BBC’s music show Top of the Pops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show was shown on Christmas Day. “The TV was on, and my mother said ‘There you are! But I missed it. And I’ve since gone to the BBC and tried to get a copy of it – they taped over it. I never got to see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBC_Future&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you liked this story, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=fut.bbc.email.we.email-signup&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

<title>A16Z is re-registering as a financial advisor, renouncing its status as a VC</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-is-blowing-up-the-venture-capital-model-again/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-is-blowing-up-the-venture-capital-model-again/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;merging from the financial crisis in 2009, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz laid out their campaign to take on Silicon Valley. The pitch deck for their first venture capital fund that year promised to find a new generation of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=8011518&amp;amp;page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;megalomaniacal&lt;/a&gt;” founders—ambitious, assertive, singularly focused—who would, in the mold of CEO Steve Jobs, use technology to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macworld.com/article/1162827/steve-jobs-making-a-dent-in-the-universe.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;put a dent in the universe.&lt;/a&gt;” In getting behind the likes of Facebook and Twitter, with a war chest that swelled into the billions, they proceeded to do exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perched on a couch in his office at Andreessen Horowitz’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Andreessen, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/08/09/remembering-netscape/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Netscape browser&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent company IPO were touchstone moments of the digital age, understands that the original word choice doesn’t land so well in 2019. His new take: “The 21st century is the century of disagreeableness,” he says, sitting down with &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; for his first extended interview in two years. In an era of hyper-connectivity, social media and information overload, he says, those “disagreeables” will challenge the status quo and create billion-dollar companies. Ego is out, anger—or dissidence, at least—is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s an equally unpleasant prospect, consider Andreessen, who’s 47, the perfect messenger. From showy check-writing to weaponizing his popular blog and (before Trump) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pmarca?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; to hiring an army of operational experts in a field built on low-key partnerships, he’s one of Silicon Valley’s poster boys for upending the rules. And it’s worked: In one decade, Andreessen Horowitz joined the elite VC gatekeepers of Silicon Valley while generating $10 billion-plus in estimated profits, at least on paper, to its investors. Over the next year or so, expect no less than five of its unicorns—Airbnb, Lyft, PagerDuty, Pinterest and Slack—to go public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the number one form of differentiation in any industry? Being number one,” lectures Andreessen, who—at 6-foot-5 with a shaved dome that his wife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiraforbes/2012/09/18/with-great-wealth-comes-great-responsibility/#15dde6a13097&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt; Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, has been known to lovingly call “my egg”—carries himself with a brio to match his words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taying number one, however, is even harder than getting there. Optimism that technology will transform the world for the better has soured with each successive Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/12/21/18149099/delete-facebook-scandals-2018-cambridge-analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;data scandal&lt;/a&gt; (Andreessen, an early investor, still sits on Facebook’s board). Every revelation of social media’s tendency to foster society’s worst forces poses a challenge to his and his firm’s trademark techno-evangelism. And in the conference rooms of Sand Hill Road, stakes in the next Instagram, Twitter or Skype—three of its best-known early deals—are no longer the upstart VC firm’s for the taking. Today there are a record number of rival billion-dollar funds and a newer kid on the block in SoftBank, which, armed with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-27/masayoshi-son-softbank-and-the-100-billion-blitz-on-sand-hill-road&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;$100 billion megafund&lt;/a&gt;, makes them all—Andreessen Horowitz included—look quaint. And one thing about saying you’re going to fix a broken industry—you create plenty of competitors who won’t hesitate to capitalize on even a whiff of doubt that you can back up the hype with results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Andreessen and Horowitz, who rank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-andreessen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;55th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/ben-horowitz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;73rd&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, on this year’s Forbes &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbes.com/midas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Midas List&lt;/a&gt;, intend to be disagreeable themselves. They just finished raising a soon-to-be announced $2 billion fund (bringing total assets under management to nearly $10 billion) to write even bigger checks for portfolio companies and unicorns the firm missed the first time. More aggressively, they tell &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that they are registering their entire firm—a costly move requiring reviews of all 150 people—as a financial advisor, renouncing Andreessen Horowitz’s status as a venture capital firm entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, venture capitalists have long traded a lack of Wall Street-style oversight for the promise that they invest mainly in new shares of private companies. It was a tradeoff firms gladly made—until the age of crypto, a type of high-risk investment the SEC says requires more oversight. So be it, says Andreessen Horowitz. By renouncing its venture capital status, it’ll be able to go deeper on riskier bets: If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or tokens, or buy unlimited shares in public companies or from other investors, it can. And in doing so, the thinking goes, it’ll again make other firms feel like they have one hand tied behind their back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What else are feathers for? They just like to get ruffled,” Andreessen says with a smirk. “The thing that stands out is the thing that’s different.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rom the beginning, Andreessen Horowitz had a simple credo: “We wanted to build the venture capital firm that we always wanted to take money from,” Horowitz says. Andreessen, whose Netscape breakthrough landed him on the cover of &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960219,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by age 24, didn’t need the fame. And neither needed the money. Colleagues at Netscape, they then cofounded a company that eventually became Opsware, run by Horowitz, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=170105&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;sold it to HP&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 for $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before founding their venture firm two years later, the pair dabbled in angel investing, where they gained a rebellious reputation, at least by the khakis-and-button-down standards of the Sand Hill Road crowd. Andreessen helped popularize startup advice through his “pmarca” &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmarchive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual predecessor of his ­Twitter stream, which became known for its surprise 140-character micro-essays on subjects from economic theory to net neutrality. (He’s widely credited with popularizing the term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tweet-stormed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt;.”) Horowitz, meanwhile, had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/technology/blogger-uses-rap-to-teach-pithy-business-lessons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; for his ability to cite rap lyrics and his fandom for the relatively rough-and-tumble Oakland Raiders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build their VC firm, Andreessen and Horowitz modeled their brand strategy not on the industry’s elite but on Larry Ellison’s Oracle and its aggressive marketing during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/765003/1/oracle-and-siebel-wage-a-war-of-words.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;enterprise software wars&lt;/a&gt;. They embraced the media, hosted star-studded events and badmouthed traditional venture capital to anyone who would listen. And while they started with small seed checks to companies like Okta (now valued at $9 billion) and Slack ($7 billion), they ignored traditional wisdom and gobbled up shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook when those companies were already valued in the billions. For one investor in their funds, Prince­ton University’s chief investment officer Andrew Golden, it became a running joke how long it would take for other firms to complain about Andreessen Horowitz. “In the early days, it was within two minutes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andreessen Horowitz staff at the company's headquarters on Sand Hill Road.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by prior exits and some scrimping, Andreessen and Horowitz reinvested their money in the business, whose structure was modeled more on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2016/09/an-interview-with-james-andrew-miller-about-powerhouse-the-untold-story-of-hollywoods-creative-artists-agency.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Hollywood talent agency&lt;/a&gt; than a traditional venture capital firm. Neither drew a salary for years, and new general partners at the firm took lower salaries than is typical. Instead, much of its fees, the traditional 2% of funds managed that covers all of a firm’s expenses, went into a fast-growing services team, including experts in marketing, business development, finance and recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to raise another funding round? Andreessen Horowitz specialists would give you “superpowers,” helping write your presentation, then coaching you through dozens of dry runs before scheduling the meets. Need a vice president of engineering? The firm’s talent team would identify and tap the best search firm, monitor its effectiveness and help choose the best candidate for the job. Human re­sources problem? Accounting crisis? “If something is going off the rails, you have the ‘Batphone,’ ” says Lea Endres, the CEO of NationBuilder, which makes software for nonprofit and political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the firm’s executive briefing centers at headquarters and in a New York satellite office, Andreessen Horowitz staff played matchmaker, enticing big corporations and government agencies with the prospect of seeing cutting-edge tech, then lining up relevant portfolio startups to present to the visitors. GitHub, the open-source-code repository the firm backed in 2012 before it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/microsoft-closes-its-7-5b-purchase-of-code-sharing-platform-github/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft for $7.5 billion, found the briefings so lucrative—good for $20 million in new recurring revenue in 2015 and 2016—that it posted a junior staffer to hang around the Andreessen Horowitz office full-time, its sales chief says. Consumer startups like the grocery delivery unicorn Instacart (a 2014 investment that now has a $7.9 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instacart-funding/instacart-wins-271-million-in-new-funding-in-november-source-idUSKCN1NJ2TY?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;valuation&lt;/a&gt;) scored partnerships with national retailers and food brands. On a recent visit in March, a dozen startups filed through one by one to meet with the Defense Innovation Unit, the branch of the Department of Defense that helps U.S. armed forces find and pay for new technologies. The day before, it was Hachette Book Group. “We’ve had companies where it’s 40% to 60% of their pipeline, and I’m like, whoa, wait, we are not your sales force,” says Martin Casado, an enterprise-focused general partner at the firm who sold his Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup, Nicira, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/07/vmware-buys-nicira/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;for $1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula worked. The firm’s first and third flagship funds, $300 million and $900 million, respectively, are already expected to return five times their money to investors, sources say. Its $650 million second fund and $1.7 billion fourth fund are expected to return three times their investment capital, good for the top quartile of firms, and are expected to climb. A $1.6 billion fifth fund, from 2016, is too young for estimated returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may be unwilling to credit Andreessen Horowitz publicly, other firms have clearly followed suit. From bloggers and podcast experts to resident finance officers and security experts, the number of non-investor professionals in the venture industry has swelled in recent years. “The idea of providing services, that feels like a table-stakes item now,” says Semil Shah, general partner at venture firm Haystack. “A lot of firms copied that.” At Okta, cofounder Frederic Kerrest says he’s routinely approached by other firms curious about building their own briefing centers to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-embed-link color-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/midas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5c9bd95931358e79cabfd46f/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=1920&amp;amp;cropY1=-1&amp;amp;cropY2=457&quot; alt=&quot;uncaptioned image&quot; data-height=&quot;458&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll this crowing and nose-thumbing has made enemies. Other investors never forgot how Andreessen Horowitz claimed the business was broken and it alone had the recipe to fix it. Almost from the beginning, gossip about the firm overpaying for deals was rampant, enough so that when Andreessen and Horowitz set out to raise their third main fund in 2012, the partners had to check every position with their port­folio companies so they could disprove the notion with their investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, their failed investments—and there have been high-profile ones, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/15/clunk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Clinkle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Jawbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-billion-dollar-startup-fab-died-2015-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Fab&lt;/a&gt;—and big missteps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-amid-scandal/#238c475a8314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Zenefits&lt;/a&gt; get magnified. Andreessen Horowitz’s well-publicized view, one it still holds, was that what matters is not how many companies you back that fail but how many become massive, outlier successes. Andreessen argues that only 15 deals per year generate all the returns, and he’s intent on seeing all the hot deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swinging for home runs magnifies whiffs, and Andreessen Horowitz blew the highest-profile Midas-list mover of recent years: Uber. The firm doesn’t admit to it now, but several sources with knowledge of the fundraising reveal just how close the firm was to getting a big stake—before letting it slip through its grasp. The until-now mostly untold story: In the fall of 2011, Uber’s ­cofounder Travis Kalanick was raising a red-hot Series B funding round and was keen to have Andreessen Horowitz lead. The firm, Andreessen in particular, was just as hungry to make it happen. By early October, Kalanick was calling other firms to tell them he had a handshake in place with Andreessen and another partner at a value somewhere around $300 million. At the 11th hour, however, the firm blinked. It would still invest, but with a structure that would value Uber at significantly less—$220 million, not counting the investment or an employee option pool, according to an email from Kalanick obtained by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They tried to surprise us,” Kalanick wrote his investors. “So here we are. The next phase of Uber begins.” Kalanick instead turned to Menlo Ventures—which until then was being used as a stalking horse for leverage—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/uber-announces-32-million-in-funding/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt; its $290 million price pre-deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Andreessen Horowitz backed Uber rival Lyft in 2013 and has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-sells-some-lyft-shares-to-prince-al-waleed-1455145074&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;already cashed out&lt;/a&gt; some of those shares at a profit, the firm wasn’t done with Uber. It participated in merger discussions between the two ride-hailing companies in 2014 and again in 2016, according to sources involved in the talks. If the deal had gone through, it would have given the firm a backdoor route to a piece of Uber. Either way, it’s hard to ignore Uber as the one that got away. The ride-hailing company, now valued at $76 billion, is getting ready for an IPO that could be four or fives times larger than Lyft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/03/29/investor-interest-drives-lyft-to-24-billion-valuation-but-it-still-wont-make-founders-billionaires/#368e9d4a4ba6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;was in March&lt;/a&gt;. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment on Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen Horowitz’s leadership has taken other raps. It was slow to diversify its management ranks—as recently as last year’s Midas List, all ten general partners, the people who actually control investments and write checks, were men—in part because it had a rule that GPs were required to be ex-startup founders and couldn’t rise up from the inside. In the past year they’ve added three women GPs but not before bleeding top talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote-embed embed-32 bg-accent color-base font-accent bleed&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By renouncing venture capital status, Andreessen Horowitz says it’ll go deeper on riskier bets: If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or buy unlimited amounts of shares in public companies or from other investors, it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen himself was caught on the wrong side of a fast-changing cultural climate in Silicon Valley in the months leading up to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, responding chummily &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/6708/marc-andreessen-twitter-faves-alt-right?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=cm6trcdl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;by tweet&lt;/a&gt; to the now-banned far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/mark-zuckerberg-marc-andreessens-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;seeming to joke&lt;/a&gt;, after India refused a new Facebook service, that the country might have fared better under colonial rule—earning a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102645335962321&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;rare scolding&lt;/a&gt; from Mark Zuckerberg. In response, Andreessen became a digital recluse, deleting most of his past tweets. Andreessen says the purge wasn’t due to the backlash against his Facebook positions, though “that didn’t help”; rather, he blames “the general climate,” specifically in politics and culture. He may come back, he says, when things “go back to normal,” perhaps in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Andreessen and Horowitz have quieted down their bluster in recent years. Andreessen admits that, contrary to what they maintained when they were Young Turks, “venture capital wasn’t an industry in crisis,” but says it doesn’t matter how the firm got to its top-tier position. Horowitz goes further. “I kind of regret it, because I feel like I hurt people’s feelings who were perfectly good businesses,” he says. “I went too far.” As for the firm’s hiring rules, which contributed to its failure to add a woman GP, he admits it was hard for him to change something that had been such a core part of the firm’s outward-facing identity. “It’s a kind of a big thing for especially me to eat crow on,” he says. “It took probably longer than it should’ve to change it, but we changed it.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arlier this spring, a small group of Andreessen Horowitz executives gathers in a bright little conference room at its headquarters for a pitch meeting with a pair of founders from a low-profile but in-demand biotech company. The twist: The VCs are pitching the entrepreneurs, with operating team leaders advertising their own services to the startup, a health diagnostics company still in stealth mode. The entrepreneurs appear skeptical. When they met Andreessen Horo­witz two years ago, after it wrote a small check in their seed round, the firm didn’t have much to offer bio startups. So for the next hour, they’re treated to example after example of how Andreessen Horowitz has added dedicated experts and connections to companies like UnitedHealth and Kaiser Permanente over the past 18 months. “We’ve found that a biotech company in Silicon Valley is really different from building just a tech company,” Shannon Schiltz, the firm’s technical talent chief, says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reverse pitch is emblematic of the new-version Andreessen Horowitz. Besides turning the typical venture capital process on its head, the firm is investing in biotech, which it once said it would never touch. But scale and the pursuit of challengers to the status quo means pushing into new areas, and the firm has raised $650 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/11/18/andreessen-horowitz-launches-biotech-software-fund/#195276477968&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;across two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-450-million-bio-fund/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;funds&lt;/a&gt; for the sector. “The brand doesn’t carry the weight in bio that it does in the tech community yet,” says Jorge Conde, a general partner since 2017. “But we’ve made a concerted effort and planted the flag.” Specialists like Conde, who led strategy for Syros, a public genetics company, and cofounded a genome startup, are now the norm. Partners meet in committees by topic three times a week to evaluate deals, then convene as one firm on Mondays and Fridays to review likely investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to crypto. Last year the firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/06/25/a16z-hires-first-female-gp-for-crypto-fund/#3151e3e03b04&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;raised a $350 million fund&lt;/a&gt; in the up-and-down area. But until recently partners Chris Dixon and Katie Haun would meet in private with Horo­witz, their fund technically a separate legal entity from the rest of the firm. That meant they had different emails addresses and their own website, because of legal constraints on funds that register as traditional VCs. While Andreessen Horowitz was an early investor in crypto marketplace Coinbase and was one of many firms to catch cryptocurrency fever in 2017, it’s one of the few that doubled down even after the price of bitcoin and ether flatlined. SEC regulations consider such investments “high risk” and limit these stakes, as well as secondary purchases and fund or token investments, to no more than 20% of a traditional VC fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Andreessen Horowitz spent the spring embarking on one of its more disagreeable moves so far: The firm renounced its VC exemptions and registered as a financial advisor, with paperwork completed in March. It’s a costly, painful move that requires hiring compliance officers, audits for each employee and a ban on its investors talking up the portfolio or fund performance in public—even on its own podcast. The benefit: The firm’s partners can share deals freely again, with a real estate expert tag-teaming a deal with a crypto expert on, say, a blockchain startup for home buying, Haun says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’ll come in handy when the firm announces a new growth fund—expected to close in the coming weeks, a source says—that will add a fresh $2 billion to $2.5 billion for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/andreessen-horowitz-hires-its-15th-general-partner/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;newest partner&lt;/a&gt;, David George, to invest across the portfolio and in other larger, high-growth companies. Under the new rules, that fund will be able to buy up shares from founders and early investors—or trade public stocks. Along with a fund &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/08/13/a16z-venture-fund-black-celebrities-kevin-durant.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that connects African-American leaders to startups, the new growth fund will give Andreessen Horowitz four specialized funds, with more potentially to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how the firm plans to keep up in a crowded VC landscape that experts say is bifurcating between specialist seed funds and a handful of giant, all-purpose firms. Traditional firms face more pressure than ever from the top and bottom of the funnel because of more sophisticated angel investor groups and non-VC giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund, says Ilya Strebulaev, a Stanford professor who studies the industry. “Venture capital is in flux,” he says. “We should expect a lot of fundamental changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are inevitable, like the industry’s wising up to the Andreessen Horowitz playbook of using services as a deal sweetener. Or the inherent limits to the Andreessen Horowitz model, which will always require large and growing funds to cover expenses. Others are fixable, like mixed report cards from former operating employees. High pay isn’t enough for ambitious, younger staff to stick around long when there’s little chance of upward mobility, they say. And with veterans of Andreessen and Horowitz’s old company, Opsware, still spread throughout the firm, the sense that some employees get special treatment—and are immune to sanction—can sap morale. Meanwhile, the firm’s insistence on calling everyone a partner, even its most junior talent or accounting managers, might seem harmless, or an annoyance for others in the industry at worst. But if those titles are limiting the prospects of promotion and career growth, as one former partner notes, they may need to be retired like the firm’s old GP rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most risky: Being the best-known VC firm on the block, or the one competitors mock until they copy, won’t matter if sweeping changes come for the entire industry. The world continues to wake up to the degree of power and influence big tech companies like Facebook and Google have over society—from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/21/facebook-reexamine-how-recently-live-videos-are-flagged-after-christchurch-shooting/?utm_term=.3a430461c47d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;livestreaming video&lt;/a&gt; of the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooter to YouTube videos that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-youtube-pulled-these-men-down-a-vortex-of-far-right-hate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;united far-flung white nationalists&lt;/a&gt;—and to the likelihood they haven’t fully owned up to their responsibilities. Against such changing tides, the historical VC narrative of hyper-growth and Zuckerberg-like ambitions may fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a choice that could be equal parts intransigence or naiveté, Andreessen invokes Facebook’s CEO as precisely the example of the kind of disagreeable founder who has the resolve to take the necessary, wrenching steps to make things right. “He just put out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/facebook-privacy-blog.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; talking about basically reinventing Facebook around privacy and messaging,” Andreessen says in March. “Just close your eyes and imagine a classic guy in a suit doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though Andreessen says he’s too busy running the firm to have any hobbies—he’s reminded he has a young son now, too—he gives his own, grander twist to a quote from one of his favorite new TV shows, HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, to describe the mindset necessary to pull it off: “If you can’t ride two elephants at the same time, what are you doing at the circus?”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>In just a decade, Andreessen Horowitz has backed a bevy of startup blockbusters— Facebook, Instagram, Lyft, Slack—and made just as many Silicon Valley enemies. To stay ahead, it’s taking the unusual step of renouncing its venture capital status—and making even bigger, riskier bets.</og:description>

<title>Ruby&amp;#039;s Creed</title>
<link>https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every programming language has some fundamental idea(s) that drives its design and evolution. For Haskell that’s functional purity and state-of-the-art static typing, for Erlang that’s distributed programming and fault tolerance, for Clojure that’s simplicity and stability. What all these examples have in common is that they are relatively easy to understand and map to design decisions in the languages. This, in turn, makes it possible to determine down the road whether a language sticks to its core values or deviates from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby, however, is very different. It’s world famous for its unique creed - “optimizing for programming happiness”. But what does this really mean? How does one optimize for happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I’ve never heard Matz speak about this, so I’ll offer you my perspective instead - happiness is simplicity, readability, consistency, expressiveness and flexibility. If I have to describe happiness via Ruby code I’d probably do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Ruby Rocks!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having numbers that are just regular objects, instead of some special primitive type is very powerful. Having code structure that’s somewhat intuitive even to non-programmers is very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember how amazed I was, when I was starting out with Ruby, that everything was an object - even things like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I remember how impressed I was with the opportunities that came with metaprogramming and how skillfully it was employed at the core of the language. Ruby also brought to the table a reasonable blend of object-oriented and functional programming techniques, even if it never really tried to promote a functional programming style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby certainly didn’t feel perfect, but felt really good. It was way ahead of most of the competition. A fun blend of Java and Lisp. Practical, powerful, expressive and flexible. And fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, I’ve been progressively more and more concerned with the direction in which Ruby has been heading when it comes to language design (think Ruby’s syntax). Here’s a list of changes and additions that I certainly never needed (or wanted):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ruby 1.9 hash literals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refinements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; literals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rational/Complex literals (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2/3r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2+1i&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endless ranges (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1..&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe navigation operator (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;.&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of those were bad additions in my book, though. Just unnecessary. I felt really strongly only about the hash literals and the refinements, as they brought a fair amount of complexity with them. Creating a special hash syntax that could express only a subset (although quite large) of all possible hash literals felt very short-sighted to me. I know that syntax really took off, but I still don’t like it. I’m used to it, but I don’t like it. I won’t say anything about refinements - I think their almost non-existing adoption is the perfect case style of their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other changes on my list had small impact and fit well with the existing language design, so I didn’t really care about their addition much. Still, I was disappointed when the safe navigation operator as introduced, as it basically acknowledged that it’s fine to return &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of completeness, here are some changes that I really enjoyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lambda literals (a.k.a. stabby lambdas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to use symbols as procs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squiggly heredocs (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;~&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen string literals pragma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making UTF-8 the default source code encoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fixnum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What all of them have in common what they solve actual problems in an unobtrusive way. I know that this is all very subjective, of course, but somehow I felt that all them fit very well in the rest of Ruby. Judging by the feedback all of them received and the wide adoption they got, I assume many people enjoyed them as well. Then again - Ruby 1.9 hashes are widely adopted as well. :-) I hope you get my point. Now back to the my frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tipping point for me, however, was just a couple of weeks ago when it was announced that Ruby 2.7 would feature the following syntax for named block parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# now&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each_slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Ruby 2.7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each_slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I really don’t think that saving a couple of characters is worth introducing special syntax. Not to mention a syntax that reduces to some extent the readability of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you push this to the extreme, consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Go Fish: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# vs&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Go Fish: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new syntax was embraced by some, but it also was heavily criticized by others (including yours truly). There’s even an ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15723&quot;&gt;“petition”&lt;/a&gt; to make Matz reconsider its addition (or at least its current form). I sincerely hope that by the time you’ve finished reading this article you’ll support it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things about this syntax I dislike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the new named variables look like instance variables this adds a bit of cognitive overhead (and might break the syntax-highlighting in certain editors, which had a special coloring for instance vars, based on their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; prefix).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It hides the number of parameters yielded to the block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It promotes the use of cryptic names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, in simple cases the new syntax looks OK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;upcase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why force people to learn new syntax for something as simple as that. Especially given the existence of other shorthand notations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:upcase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This will be simplified in Ruby 2.7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve got a new syntax that’s not shorter than what we can currently do (in the most command case with one parameter), and is not really as expressive as the “classic” syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find it amusing that Ruby 2.7 introduced another similar feature, that’s more in line with what have been promoted so far - namely the method reference operator (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.:&lt;/code&gt;). Its main usecase covers one of the typical usecases for the numbered parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;log2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;log2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:log2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.:&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t really get any awards for code elegance, it least it’s aligned with another existing pattern in Ruby. Victor Shepelev echoes my sentiment almost precisely &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15723#note-44&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to numbered block parameters. I really want someone to explain to me how a language change like this one fits with “optimizing for happiness”. What is the problem we had to solve that required the inclusion of syntax that’s far from ideal (as acknowledged by Matz himself)? Why did suddenly a 7 year old ticket went into development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, don’t forget the extra impact of every language change. Now tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whitequark/parser&quot;&gt;parser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubocop-hq&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt; have to account for the new syntax. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide&quot;&gt;Ruby Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; should advise when it’s appropriate to use this and when it’s not. RuboCop should automate those suggestions into cops. Code that uses the new feature won’t be backwards compatible. And then we’re stuck with it forever.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So much hassle for something so trivial that literally solves nothing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s what passes for “optimizing for happiness” these days I think we’ve got a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;epilogue&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is not intended as a rant. It’s intended to be a conversation starter. I want to make it crystal clear that I’m not one of those people who’d just argue against innovation just for the sake of arguing. I understand that this syntax has some limited application here and there, and I understand that there might be people who even find it appealing and highly desirable. But I’m also certain that this feature can be implemented better than it currently is.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion half-baked micro-optimizations add nothing, but complexity in the long run, and should be avoided. I’m really worried that Ruby has been gradually losing its way and has strayed from its creed. I hope this post will be a wake up call for some of you and will gain the attention of the Ruby Core Team as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a believer in languages designed by a committee and I have faith in Matz making reasonable decisions at the end of the day. However, I’m also a big believer in sticking to your values, developing a language that’s consistent and elegant. Random additions here and there stick out like sore thumbs, and are a recipe for frustration and friction in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz has been talking a lot in recent years about the big initiatives on the horizon (a.k.a. Ruby 3.0) like duck typing, faster performance (Ruby 3x3), introducing a better concurrency API (Guilds), repackaging the standard library, and the tools surrounding Ruby. I haven’t heard much in the direction of evolving Ruby from a syntactic perspective, though, and I’m left wondering if there’s any strategy there at all, or we’re just figuring things as we go. Actually, I lied to you - once I listened to Matz discuss for quite a while why it’s a good idea to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; as an alias to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yield_self&lt;/code&gt; and this worried me even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby actually has real problems to solve, and it’d be really great if someone focused on those. To wrap it up, I’d like to go back to the very beginning - Ruby’s creed. Here’s how the language is described on Ruby’s official web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– ruby-lang.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone suggesting new Ruby functionality and everyone from Ruby’s Core Team should remind themselves of this occasionally. Simplicity and elegant syntax are not things that happens by themselves - they require a lot of hard work and consideration. Now let’s go back to optimizing for happiness once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; I’d really love to hear what do you think about all of this. Do you like all the language changes made in Ruby in the 2.x series? What’s the meaning of “optimizing for happiness” for you? Where do you think Ruby really needs to evolve in terms of syntax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2019-04-03):&lt;/strong&gt; I guess the timing of my article was pretty good, as today another controversial feature landed in Ruby - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/95f7992b89efd35de6b28ac095c4d3477019c583&quot;&gt;beginless ranges&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;..10&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to their description A beginless range “they might not be as useful as an endless range, but would be good for DSL purpose”. There’s also a bit of example code to go with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# identical to ary[0..3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;sales: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example looks pretty weird to me (I can easily imagine a clearer DSL like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where { sales &amp;lt; 100 }&lt;/code&gt;), but the array usage seems reasonable. Given the presence of endless ranges already, I don’t think this is a bad addition per se, but it’s definitely one with very limited potential usefulness. I’ll leave it for you to decide if beginless ranges fit Ruby’s creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed today that the post has stirred quite the conversation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19560479#19564613&quot;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t have the time to go over all comments, but I’ve noticed that relatively few people are discussing Ruby’s philosophy and its overarching language design, and way more people are just arguing about syntax or saying I’m just another raging lunatic, who’s venting out. While I find this to be a bit disappointing, I don’t find it surprising at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, surprisingly a lot of people are arguing about the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;.&lt;/code&gt; operator in the comments, so it probably makes sense to make my position on it a bit clearer. Long story short - it’s useful, but it’s also dangerous in non-obvious ways. I dislike it mostly because it can really obscure the intent of some code and it really begs you to violate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter&quot;&gt;Law of Demeter&lt;/a&gt;. People would normally say that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;.&lt;/code&gt; solves real problems and give you a simple example like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;adress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law of Demeter aside, it makes sense. Consider, however, a few more subtle examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# A quick recipe for leaking nil returns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Can any one of those methods return nil or just the first one? Go figure!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bax&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Does any of those methods return nil or someone just decided to play it safe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# and introduced a potential nil return value that we now have to handle?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bax&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# How did we allow file to potentially be nil to begin with?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately most people would happily cut some corners today than think about the long term maintenance and evolution of the code they are working on. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguild.nl/5-reasons-not-to-use-safe-navigation-operators/&quot;&gt;nice post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject that resonates strongly with how I feel about the safe navigation operator.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Ruby’s Creed</og:title>
<og:description>Every programming language has some fundamental idea(s) that drives its design and evolution. For Haskell that’s functional purity and state-of-the-art static typing, for Erlang that’s distributed programming and fault tolerance, for Clojure that’s simplicity and stability. What all these examples have in common is that they are relatively easy to understand and map to design decisions in the languages. This, in turn, makes it possible to determine down the road whether a language sticks to its core values or deviates from them. Ruby, however, is very different. It’s world famous for its unique creed - “optimizing for programming happiness”. But what does this really mean? How does one optimize for happiness? Unfortunately I’ve never heard Matz speak about this, so I’ll offer you my perspective instead - happiness is simplicity, readability, consistency, expressiveness and flexibility. If I have to describe happiness via Ruby code I’d probably do it like this: 3.times do puts &quot;Ruby Rocks!&quot; end</og:description>

<title>25 Years Later: Interview with Linus Torvalds</title>
<link>https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;'s very first issue featured an interview between &lt;em&gt;LJ&lt;/em&gt;'s first Publisher, Robert Young (who went on to co-found Red Hat among other things), and Linus Torvalds (author of the Linux kernel). After 25 years, we thought it'd be interesting to get the two of them together again. You can read that first interview from 1994 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2736&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interview: Linus Torvalds and Robert Young&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Young:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a great pleasure to have an excuse to reach out to you. How are you and your family? Your kids must be through college by now. Nancy and I and our three daughters are all doing well. Our eldest, Zoe, who was 11 when Marc and I started Red Hat, is expecting her second child—meaning I'm a grandparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus Torvalds:&lt;/strong&gt; None of my kids are actually &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with college yet, although Patricia (oldest) will graduate this May. And Celeste (youngest) is in her senior year of high school, so we'll be empty-nesters in about six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three are doing fine, and I suspect/hope it will be a few years until the grandparent thing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; When I first interviewed you back in 1994, did you think that you'd be still maintaining this thing in 2019?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that by 1994 I had already become surprised that my latest project hadn't just been another &quot;do something interesting until it does everything I needed, and then find something else to do&quot; project. Sure, it was fairly early in the development, but it had already been something that I had spent a few years on by then, and had already become something with its own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I'm trying to say is not that I necessarily expected to do it for another few decades, but that it had already passed the bump of becoming something fairly big in my life. I've never really had a long-term plan for Linux, and I have taken things one day at a time rather than worry about something five or ten years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a famous old quote about the danger of achieving your dreams—your running joke back in the day when asked about your future goals for Linux was &quot;world domination&quot;. Now that you and the broader Open Source/Free Software community have achieved that, what's next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I stopped doing the &quot;world domination&quot; joke long ago, because it seemed to become less of a joke as time went on. But it always &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a joke, and it wasn't why I (or any of the other developers) really did what we did anyway. It was always about just making better technology and having interesting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And none of that has really changed on a core level. All the details have changed—the hardware is very different, the problems we have are very different, and my role is very different. But the whole &quot;make it better and have interesting challenges&quot; is all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, back in 1994, I was mostly a developer. Sure, I was the lead maintainer, but while I spent a lot of time merging patches, I was also mostly writing my own code. These days I seldom write much code, and the code I write is often pseudo-code or example patches that I send out in emails to the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; developers. I'd hesitate to call myself a &quot;manager&quot;, because I don't really do things like yearly reviews or budgets, etc. (thank God!), but I definitely am more of a technical lead person than an actual programmer, and that's been true for the last many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the truly big-picture thing hasn't changed, but my role and all the details obviously look very very different from 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Where will you and this code base be in another quarter century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I'll be 75 by then, and I doubt I'll be involved day to day. But considering that I've been doing this for almost 30 years, maybe I'd still be following the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the good news is that we really do have a pretty solid developer base, and I'm not worried about &quot;where will Linus be&quot; kind of issues. Sure, people have been talking about how kernel developers are getting older for a long time now, but that's not really because we wouldn't be getting any new people, it's literally because we still have a lot of people around that have been around for a long time, and still enjoy doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that some radical new and exciting OS would come around and supplant Linux some day (hey, back in 1994 I probably still thought that maybe Hurd would do it!), but it's not just that we've been doing this for a long time and are still doing very well, I've also come to realize that making a new operating system is just way harder than I ever thought. It really takes a lot of effort by a lot of people, and the strength of Linux—and open source in general, of course—is very much that you can build on top of the effort of all those other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unless there is some absolutely enormous shift in the computing landscape, I think Linux will be doing quite well another quarter century from now. Not because of any particular detail of the code itself, but simply fundamentally, because of the development model and the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not be active at that point, and a lot of the code will have been updated and replaced, but I think the project will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you and the kernel team been updating the kernel code to your satisfaction through the years? Is there any need or pressure to re-write any of the 25-year-old ever-expanding Linux code base? Perhaps in a more &quot;modern&quot; language than C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; We've gone through many many big rewrites of most of the subsystems over the years—not all at once, of course—and many pieces of code end up being things that nobody really wants to modify any more (most often because they are drivers for ancient hardware that very few people really use, but that we still support). But one of the advantages of a big unified source base for the whole kernel has been that when we need to make some big change, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do so. There may be a few out-of-tree drivers, etc., around (both source and binary), but we've always had a policy that if they are out of tree, they don't matter for development. So we can make radical changes when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to C, nothing better has come around. We've updated the kernel sources for new and improved features (the C language itself has changed during the years we've been doing this), and we've added various extensions on top of C for extra type-checking and runtime verification and hardening, etc., but on the whole, the language is recognizably the same except for small details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, it doesn't look likely to change. The kind of languages people see under active development aren't for low-level system programming. They are to make it easier to create user applications with fancy UIs, etc. They explicitly don't want to do things a kernel needs, like low-level manual memory management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could imagine that we'd have some &quot;framework&quot; language for generating drivers or similar, and we internally actually have our own simplified &quot;language&quot; just for doing configuration, and we do use a few other languages for the build process, so it's not like C is the only language we use. But it's the bulk of it by far, and it's what the &quot;kernel proper&quot; is written in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; What's your hardware instrument of choice? Is there a Stradivarius of Linux (or any) laptops out there? Or tablet or phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; My main development machine is a very generic PC workstation. It's a franken-machine with different parts cobbled together over the years. It's nothing particularly special, and it's actually been two years since I made any big changes to it, so it's not even anything bleeding-edge. My main requirement at home is actually that it be basically entirely silent. Outside a couple fans, there are no moving parts (so no spinning disks anywhere), and the fans are not even running most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the road (which is happily not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; often), my main requirement is a good screen and being lightweight. My target weight is 1kg (with charger), and honestly, I've not been able to hit that ideal target, but right now, the best compromise for me is the XPS13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems Linux on the desktop's success was not on the PC desktop but on the device desktop via Android. What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the traditional PC is obviously no longer quite the dominant thing it used to be. Even when you have one (and even when it's still running Windows or OS X), lots of people mainly interact with it through a web browser and a couple random apps. Of course, then there are the &quot;workstation&quot; users, which is kind of the desktop I was personally always envisioning. And while still important, it doesn't seem to drive the market the way the PC did back when. Powerful desktop machines seem to be mostly about development or gaming, or media editing. The &quot;casual&quot; desktop seems to have become more of a browser thing, and quite often it's just a tablet or a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome seems to be doing fine in some of that area too, of course. But yes, in just numbers of people interacting daily with Linux, Android is obviously the huge bulk of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note from Bob: In the strict sense of &quot;dominant&quot;, this is probably fair. But despite the recent fall in total numbers of PCs shipped in the last couple years, the cumulative growth in the PC market between 1994 and, say, 2014 is such that even in a slow PC market today, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-chart-shows-how-mobile-has-crushed-pcs-2016-04-20&quot;&gt;world is still installing four or five times as many PCs every year compared to 1994&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; If you had to fix one thing about the networked world, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/u%5Buid%5D/linus-small.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; alt=&quot;Linus Torvalds&quot; class=&quot;image-max_650x650&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linus Torvalds (Image Courtesy of Peter Adams, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facesofopensource.com/&quot;&gt;The Faces of Open Source Project&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing technical. But, I absolutely detest modern &quot;social media&quot;—Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It's a disease. It seems to encourage bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think part of it is something that email shares too, and that I've said before: &quot;On the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle&quot;. When you're not talking to somebody face to face, and you miss all the normal social cues, it's easy to miss humor and sarcasm, but it's also very easy to overlook the reaction of the recipient, so you get things like flame wars, etc., that might not happen as easily with face-to-face interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But email still &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. You still have to put in the effort to write it, and there's generally some actual content (technical or otherwise). The whole &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; model is just garbage. There is no effort and no quality control. In fact, it's all geared to the &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; of quality control, with lowest common denominator targets, and click-bait, and things designed to generate an emotional response, often one of moral outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add in anonymity, and it's just disgusting. When you don't even put your real name on your garbage (or the garbage you share or like), it really doesn't help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually one of those people who thinks that anonymity is overrated. Some people confuse privacy and anonymity and think they go hand in hand, and that protecting privacy means that you need to protect anonymity. I think that's wrong. Anonymity is important if you're a whistle-blower, but if you cannot prove your identity, your crazy rant on some social-media platform shouldn't be visible, and you shouldn't be able to share it or like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Rant over. I'm not on any social media (I tried G+ for a while, because the people on it weren't the mindless usual stuff, but it obviously never went anywhere), but it still annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; This issue of &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Kids and Linux. Is there any advice you'd like to give to young programmers/computer science students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm actually the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; person to ask. I knew I was interested in math and computers since an early age, and I was largely self-taught until university. And everything I did was fairly self-driven. So I don't understand the problems people face when they say &quot;what should I do?&quot; It's not where I came from at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; The very first time you and I met was at a Digital Equipment Company (DEC) tradeshow. It was on your very first trip to the US that Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall and DEC financed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I think actually that was my second trip to the US. The first was, I believe, a trip for me to Provo, Utah, to talk with Novell about Linux (for a project inside Novell that was then to become Caldera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, the DECUS tradeshow (in New Orleans? Maybe I misremember) was certainly among my earliest trips to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; I asked how you were going to catch up with all the emails you missed by the time you returned to Helsinki. Your answer surprised me, and I've been quoting you ever since. You simply said you would send the backlog of emails to /dev/null. I expressed shock and asked you, &quot;but what if there were important emails in your inbox?&quot; You shrugged and replied, &quot;If it was important, the writer would just send it again.&quot; Possibly the most liberating piece of advice anyone had ever given me. Do you still follow that philosophy of email handling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; It's still somewhat true, but at the same time, I've also changed my workflow a lot so that travel wouldn't be as disruptive to my work as it used to be. So these days I often strive to have people not even notice when I'm on the road all that much. I will give people a heads-up if I expect to be without much internet connectivity for more than a day or two (which still happens in some places of the world—particularly if you're a scuba diver), but most of the time, I can do my work from anywhere in the world. And I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes fail) to time my trips so that they're not in the merge window for me, which is when I get the most pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these days I keep all my email in the cloud, which makes it much easier to switch between machines, and it means that when I travel and use my laptop, it's not nearly as much of a pain as it used to be back in the days when I downloaded all my email to my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's not just about my email—the fact that almost all the kernel development ends up being distributed through git also means that it's much less of an issue what machine I am at, and synchronization is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier than it used to be back when I was working with patches coming in individually through email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, my &quot;if it's really important, people will re-send&quot; belief stands. People know that I'm around pretty much 7/365, and if I don't react to a pull request in a couple days, it still means that it might have gotten lost in the chaos that is my email, and people send me a follow-up email to ping me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's actually much less common than it used to be. Back in 1994, I wasn't all that overworked, and being gone a week wasn't a big deal, but it got progressively worse during the next few years, to the point where our old email-and-patches-based workflow really meant that I would sometimes have to skip patches because I didn't have the time for them, knowing that people would re-send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those times are all happily long gone. BitKeeper made a big difference for me, even if not all maintainers liked it (or used it). And now git means that I don't get thousands of patches by email any more, and my inbox doesn't look as bad as it used to be. So it's easier to stay on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, perhaps even more important than the &quot;If it was important the writer would just send it again&quot; rule is another rule I've had for the longest time: if I don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to reply, I don't. If I get a piece of email and my reaction is that somebody else could have handled it, I will just ignore it. Some busy email people have an automatic reply saying &quot;sorry, I'll try to get to your email eventually&quot;. Me, I just ignore anything where I feel it doesn't absolutely concern me. I do that simply because I feel like I can't afford to encourage people to email me more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I get a lot of email, but I don't actually &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; most of it at all. In a very real sense, much of my job is to be on top of things and know what's going on. So I see a lot of emails, but I don't usually write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; At a talk at the Washington DC Linux user group meeting back in May 1995, that Don Becker organized, you stopped halfway through and asked the audience if anyone knew the score of the Finland-Sweden men's world championship hockey game. As the token Canadian in the room, I was able to assure you that Finland won that game. On that topic: Finland's recent win of the World Junior Championship must have been fun for you. Or were you cheering for the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh. Hockey may be the Finnish national sport (and playing against Sweden makes it more personal—I &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; Swedish as my mother language, but I'm &lt;em&gt;Finnish&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to nationality), but I'm not a huge sports fan. And moving to the US didn't mean that I picked up baseball and football, it just meant that ice hockey lost that &quot;people around me cared&quot; part too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of us admire your willingness to call a spade a spade in public debates on Linux technology decisions. Others, um, dislike your forthright style of arguing. Do you think you are becoming more or less diplomatic as time has goes on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; If anything, I think I have become quieter. I wouldn't say &quot;more diplomatic&quot;, but perhaps more self-aware, and I'm trying to be less forceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it is that people read me a different way from how they used to. It used to be a more free-wheeling environment, and we were a group of geeks having fun and playing around. It's not quite the same environment any more. It's not as personal, for one thing—we have &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people involved with development now, and that's just counting actual people sending patches, not all the people working around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And part of the whole &quot;read me in a different way&quot; is that people take me seriously in a way they didn't do back in 1994. And that's absolutely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; some kind of complaint about how I wasn't taken seriously back then—quite the reverse. It's more me grumbling that people take me much too seriously now, and I can't say silly stupid cr*p any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll still call out people (and particularly companies) for doing dumb things, but now I have to do it knowing that it's news, and me giving some company the finger will be remembered for a decade afterwards. Whether deserved or not, it might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Anything else you want to comment on, either publicly or otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I've never had some &quot;message&quot; that I wanted to spread, so ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About Robert Young and What He's Been Up to in the Past 25 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduating from the University of Toronto in 1976 after studying history, Young took a job selling typewriters. In 1978, he founded his first company and then spent 15 years in Canada at the helm of two computer-leasing companies. He sold the second of these to a larger firm who moved him to Connecticut in 1992 to grow their small US subsidiary. Shortly after, the new parent company ran into financial difficulties, otherwise known as bankruptcy, and Young found himself working out of his wife's sewing closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although that event led directly to, in 1993, co-founding Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) with Marc Ewing, a young North Carolina-based software engineer. Both of them had fallen in love with free software, now known as open source—Ewing because he could innovate with software that came with source code and a license that allowed him to innovate, and Young because he could see how technology customers could be better served with open technology than the closed proprietary alternatives the industry offered at the time. Serving as CEO from founding through Red Hat's IPO in 1999, he then moved to the role of Chairman, and the brilliant Matthew Szulik took over as CEO, building the early Red Hat into a great business. Red Hat is now a member of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index of the largest US public companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Young and Ewing co-founded the Center for Public Domain, a non-profit foundation created to bolster healthy conversation of intellectual property, patent and copyright law, and the management of the public domain for the common good. Grant recipients included the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Young purchased the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League, and he currently serves as the league's Vice-Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with a talented team led by Gart Davis, he helped launch Lulu.com in 2004 as the first online self-publishing services to use print-on-demand technology to enable a new generation of authors to bring their works directly to market, avoiding the delays, expense and limited profitability of publishing through traditional channels. Under the direction of Kathy Hensgen, Lulu continues to be a leading innovator helping authors bring their works to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Young invested in PrecisionHawk, a small drone company led by Ernie Earon and Christopher Dean. PrecisionHawk, based in Raleigh, has become one of the leading drone technology companies in the US. He continues to serve as Chairman, with CEO Michael Chasen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, Young has been involved with Scott Mitchell and a team based in Toronto, helping organize the Canadian Premier League, a professional soccer league in Canada. He owns the Hamilton Forge franchise. The league will begin play this month (April 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favorite current project is helping his wife Nancy run Raleigh-based Elizabeth Bradley Design Ltd and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://needlepoint.com&quot;&gt;Needlepoint.com&lt;/a&gt; store, a leading needlepoint supplier. Their mission is nothing less than to make the world a more beautiful place, by growing the community of enthusiastic needlepointers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most beloved pastime is spending time with his growing family. He and his wife Nancy welcomed their first grandchild a year ago. Young also enjoys pursuing a bunch of hobbies, always badly. These include fly fishing, kite boarding, golf, and he collects the occasional antique typewriter—a nod to his beginnings as a typewriter salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sidenote: the Faces of Open Source Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peteradamsphoto.com/people/linus-torvalds&quot;&gt;photo of Linus&lt;/a&gt; in this article is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peteradamsphoto.com&quot;&gt;Peter Adams&lt;/a&gt;, a photographer I met a few months ago when he introduced me to a series he started in 2014 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://facesofopensource.com&quot;&gt;Faces of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;. On that site, Peter writes, &quot;Despite its wide ranging impact, the open source revolution remains all but unknown to most people who now, more than ever before, depend on its survival. This project is an attempt to change that.&quot; His purpose applies not only to the muggles who rely on open source, but to the wizards who write their own code and put it to use. Knowing who created the Open Source world we have now will surely help as we code up a future that embodies the same good values.—Doc Searls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Asking for Some New Users&amp;#039; Email Passwords</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks after admitting it stored hundreds of millions of its users’ own passwords insecurely, Facebook is demanding some users fork over the password for their outside email account as the price of admission to the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook users are being interrupted by an interstitial demanding they provide the password for the email account they gave to Facebook when signing up. “To continue using Facebook, you’ll need to confirm your email,” the message demands. “Since you signed up with [email address], you can do that automatically …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form below the message asked for the users’ “email password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s beyond sketchy,” security consultant Jake Williams told the Daily Beast. “They should not be taking your password or handling your password in the background. If that’s what’s required to sign up with Facebook, you’re better off not being on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement emailed to The Daily Beast after this story published, Facebook reiterated its claim it doesn’t store the email passwords. But the company also announced it will end the practice altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand the password verification option isn’t the best way to go about this, so we are going to stop offering it,” Facebook wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how widely the new measure was deployed, but in its statement Facebook said users retain the option of bypassing the password demand and activating their account through more conventional means, such as “a code sent to their phone or a link sent to their email.” Those options are presented to users who click on the words “Need help?” in one corner of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional login step &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/originalesushi/status/1112496649891430401&quot;&gt;was noticed&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend by a cybersecurity watcher on Twitter called “e-sushi.” The Daily Beast tested the claim by establishing a new Facebook account under circumstances the company’s system might flag as suspicious, using a disposable webmail address and connecting through a VPN in Romania. A reporter was taken to the same screen demanding the email password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By going down that road, you're practically fishing for passwords you are not supposed to know!,” e-sushi wrote in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small print below the password field promises, “Facebook won’t store your password.” But the company has recently been criticized for repurposing information it originally acquired for “security” reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-lets-anyone-view-your-profile-with-2fa-phone-number&quot;&gt;was caught&lt;/a&gt; allowing advertisers to target its users using phone numbers users provided for two-factor authentication; users handed over their numbers so Facebook could send a text message with a secret code when they log in. More recently the company drew the ire of privacy advocates when it began making those phone numbers searchable, so anyone can locate the matching user “in defiance of user expectations and security best practices,” &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/facebook-doubles-down-misusing-your-phone-number&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also has a checkered history when it comes to securely handling passwords. Last month the company acknowledged that &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/&quot;&gt;unencrypted passwords&lt;/a&gt; for hundreds of millions of its users &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-passwords-in-plain-text-report&quot;&gt;had been stored for years&lt;/a&gt; in company logs accessible to 2,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, amid a steady drum beat of fresh privacy scandals, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unleashed a thousand-word manifesto describing  a new “privacy-focused vision” &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-youve-napped-through-the-last-decade&quot;&gt;for the company&lt;/a&gt; built on strong encryption and cutting-edge security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook’s putative pivot-to-privacy would meet with some skepticism. “[F]rankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>‘Beyond Sketchy’: Facebook Demands Users’ Email Passwords</og:title>
<og:description>Mark Zuckerberg admitted recently that Facebook doesn’t have a ‘strong reputation’ for privacy. An odd new request for private data probably won’t help with that rep.</og:description>
