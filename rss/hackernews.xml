<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;OP used an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s90z9tc-27 hnLHXO&quot; href=&quot;https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi224mc&quot;&gt;ASI224MC&lt;/a&gt; for the Moon exposures for this image. This is a camera which uses a similar sensor compared to your average DSLR, but it is smaller and has no moving parts, capable of taking dozens to hundreds of frames per second depending on what resolution you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;The software for capture, stacking, and processing is all free, thankfully. Firecapture is a popular capture software - as the ASI224MC has no viewfinder it relies on laptop control for operation. Autostakkert!2 is a popular stacking software (it aligns the Moon for each image and averages the pixel values), and either Registax or Photoshop can be used for sharpening afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;As for stacking, our atmosphere distorts incoming light, such as Moonlight. You can see this effect on a hot day when you look across a parking lot, the air will shimmer. This is compounded by the fact that even when the Moon is directly overhead, you are still looking through roughly 100 miles of air. The method then used to pick out those millisecond-long moments where the Moon is actually sharp and in focus is called Lucky Imaging, and it is why OP takes so many frames. For planetary imaging 50,000 is not too uncommon, though you can get decent enough results with as little as a few hundred with a calm atmosphere free of dust. As an example, I took &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s90z9tc-27 hnLHXO&quot; href=&quot;https://www.astrobin.com/full/351168/0/?nc=user&quot;&gt;this mosaic&lt;/a&gt; with the same camera OP used, using a total of about 100,000 frames, but spread through about 55 panels since my telescope is comparable to a ~2000mm lens (and since the camera sensor is so small, it only picks up a portion of that field of view). Click &quot;full resolution&quot; at your own peril, for those on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;The other advantage of stacking multiple images is noise reduction. Cameras have some amount of random noise in each frame, which is the grainy effect you often see in darker images. Astrophotography is all about signal-to-noise ratios, with the primary goal being to increase this ratio through varying methods of noise reduction, such as image stacking. The great thing about random noise is that you can get rid of most of it by stacking about 40 images, with some decreasing benefit using higher numbers of images. Obviously 50,000 would reduce it to tiny levels, but in the case of planetary imaging, which uses very short exposures, the main advantage of stacking is to get around the atmospheric blurring. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s90z9tc-27 hnLHXO&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cloudynights.com/uploads/monthly_07_2018/post-273658-0-74013300-1530665326.jpg&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of the benefits of stacking I found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Capturing the night sky via long exposure is another animal. Long exposure introduces not only random noise, but some heat-related noise caused by the camera taking so long for each exposure. This can be partially reduced through stacking (for long exposure, we use a free software called Deep Sky Stacker, which will identify and align images to detected stars), but also benefits from calibration images called Darks. These are exposures identical to the ones you took of the night sky except with the lens cap on. Using this method, you can capture only the camera noise, which is subtracted from each image of the night sky before then stacking them together. In this manner, you can remove the predictable noise as well as the random noise for a clean image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Also in the case of night sky long exposure, you will require a tracking mount. For bright objects like the Moon or planets, you can get away with using a manually-driven telescope, but since the Earth rotates, the stars will move during the exposure and thus require a tracking mount to counteract this. Widefield lenses (14mm or so) can get away with static tripod imaging since the stars don't noticeably move as fast, but anything 50mm or beyond will likely require a tracking mount for decent imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cache Eviction: When Are Randomized Algorithms Better Than LRU? (2014)</title>
<link>http://danluu.com/2choices-eviction/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://danluu.com/2choices-eviction/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Caches: LRU v. random&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;217.75126732004&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caches: LRU v. random&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sohi/&quot;&gt;computer architecture professor&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that using a random eviction policy for caches really isn't so bad. That random eviction isn't bad can be surprising -- if your cache fills up and you have to get rid of something, choosing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/355/Syllabus/9-virtual-mem/LRU-replace.html&quot;&gt;least recently used (LRU)&lt;/a&gt; is an obvious choice, since you're more likely to use something if you've used it recently. If you have a tight loop, LRU is going to be perfect as long as the loop fits in cache, but it's going to cause a miss every time if the loop doesn't fit. A random eviction policy degrades gracefully as the loop gets too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, on real workloads, random tends to do worse than other algorithms. But what if we take two random choices and just use LRU between those two choices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the relative miss rates we get for SPEC CPU with a Sandy Bridge-like cache (&lt;a href=&quot;http://danluu.com/3c-conflict/&quot;&gt;8-way associative&lt;/a&gt;, 64k, 256k, and 2MB L1, L2, and L3 caches, respectively). These are ratios (algorithm miss rate : random miss rate); lower is better. Each cache uses the same policy at all levels of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Policy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L1 (64k)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L2 (256k)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;L3 (2MB)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-random&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.93&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;FIFO&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.97&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;LRU&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.97&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;random&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random and FIFO are both strictly worse than either LRU or 2-random. LRU and 2-random are pretty close, with LRU edging out 2-random for the smaller caches and 2-random edging out LRU for the larger caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if anything odd is going on in any individual benchmark, we can look at the raw results on each sub-benchmark. The L1, L2, and L3 miss rates are all plotted in the same column for each benchmark, below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sandy-bridge-miss.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cache miss rates for Sandy Bridge-like cache&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we might expect, LRU does worse than 2-random when the miss rates are high, and better when the miss rates are low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it's not clear if 2-random is beating LRU in L3 cache miss rates because it does better when the caches are large or because it does better because it's the third level in a hierarchical cache. Since a cache line that's being actively used in L1 or L2 isn't touched in L3, an eviction can happen from the L3 (which forces an eviction of both the L1 and L2) since, as far as the L3 is concerned, that line hasn't been used recently. This makes it less obvious that LRU is a good eviction policy for L3 cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To separate out the effects, let's look at the relative miss rates for a non-hierarchical (single level) vs. hierarchical caches at various sizes. For the hierarchical cache, the L1 and L2 sizes are as above, 64k and 256k, and only the L3 cache size varies. Below, we've got the geometric means of the ratios of how each policy does (over all SPEC sub-benchmarks, compared to random eviction). A possible downside to this metric is that if we have some very low miss rates, those could dominate the mean since small fluctuations will have a large effect on the ratio, but we can look the distribution of results to see if that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-mean-ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 64K and 16M&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-mean-ratios-l3.png&quot; alt=&quot;L3 cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 512K and 16M&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sizes below 512k are missing for the hierarchical case because of the 256k L2 -- we're using an inclusive L3 cache here, so it doesn't really make sense to have an L3 that's smaller than the L2. Sizes above 16M are omitted because cache miss rates converge when the cache gets too big, which is uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the single cache case, it seems that LRU works a bit better than 2-random for smaller caches (lower miss ratio is better), 2-random edges out LRU as the cache gets bigger. The story is similar in the hierarchical case, except that we don't really look at the smaller cache sizes where LRU is superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the two cases, the results are different, but similar enough that it looks our original results weren't only an artifact of looking at the last level of a hierarchical cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we'll look at the entire distribution so we can see if the mean of the ratios is being skewed by tiny results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-miss.png&quot; alt=&quot;L3 cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 512K and 16M&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-miss-l3.png&quot; alt=&quot;L3 cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 512K and 16M&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like, for a particular cache size (one column of the graph), the randomized algorithms do better when miss rates are relatively high and worse when miss rates are relatively low, so, if anything, they're disadvantaged when we just look at the geometric mean -- if we were to take the arithmetic mean, the result would be dominated by the larger results, where 2 random choices and plain old random do relatively well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what we've seen of the mean ratios, 2-random looks fine for large caches, and from what we've seen of the distribution of the results, that's despite 2-random being penalized by the mean ratio metric, which makes it seem pretty good for large caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's common to implement pseudo-LRU policies because LRU can be too expensive to be workable. Since 2-random requires having at least as much information as LRU, let's take a look at what happens we use pseudo 2-random (approximately 80% accurate), and pseudo 3-random (a two-level tournament, each level of which is approximately 80% accurate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since random and FIFO are clearly not good replacement policies, I'll leave them out of the following graphs. Also, since the results were similar in the single cache as well as multi-level cache case, we can just look at the results from the more realistic multi-level cache case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-mean-ratios-l3-pseudo.png&quot; alt=&quot;L3 cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 512K and 16M&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since pseudo 2-random acts like random 20% of the time and 2-random 80% of the time, we might expect it to fall somewhere between 2-random and random, which is exactly what happens. A simple tweak to try to improve pseudo 2-random is to try pseudo 3-random (evict the least recently used of 3 random choices). While that's still not quite as good as true 2-random, it's pretty close, and it's still better than LRU (and pseudo LRU) for caches larger than 1M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one big variable we haven't explored is the set associativity. To see how LRU compares with 2-random across different cache sizes let's look at the LRU:2-random miss ratio (higher/red means LRU is better, lower/green means 2-random is better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://danluu.com/images/2choices-eviction/sweep-sizes-assocs-mean-ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cache miss ratios for cache sizes between 64K and 16M with associativities between and 64&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, increasing associativity increases the difference between the two policies. As before, LRU is better for small caches and 2-random is better for large caches. Associativities of 1 and 2 aren't shown because they should be identical for both algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a combinatorial explosion of possibilities we haven't tried yet. One thing to do is to try different eviction policies at different cache levels (LRU for L1 and L2 with 2-random for L3 seems promising). Another thing to do is to try this for different types of caches. I happened to choose CPU caches because it's easy to find simulators and benchmark traces, but in today's “put a cache on it” world, there are a lot of other places 2-random can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any comp arch folks, from this data, I suspect that 2-random doesn't keep up with adaptive policies like DIP (although it might -- it's in the right ballpark, but it was characterized on a different workload using a different simulator, so it's not 100% clear). However, A pseudo 2-random policy can be implemented that barely uses more resources than pseudo-LRU policies, which makes this very cheap compared to DIP. Also, we can see that pseudo 3-random is substantially better than pseudo 2-random, which indicates that k-random is probably an improvement over 2-random for the k. Some k-random policy might be an improvement over DIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've seen that this works, but why would anyone think to do this in the first place? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf&quot;&gt;The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results by Mitzenmacher, Richa, and Sitaraman&lt;/a&gt; has a great explanation. The mathematical intuition is that if we (randomly) throw n balls into n bins, the maximum number of balls in any bin is &lt;code&gt;O(log n / log log n)&lt;/code&gt; with high probability, which is pretty much just &lt;code&gt;O(log n)&lt;/code&gt;. But if (instead of choosing randomly) we choose the least loaded of k random bins, the maximum is &lt;code&gt;O(log log n / log k)&lt;/code&gt; with high probability, i.e., even with two random choices, it's basically &lt;code&gt;O(log log n)&lt;/code&gt; and each additional choice only reduces the load by a constant factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turns out to have all sorts of applications; things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/17/two-random.html&quot;&gt;load balancing&lt;/a&gt; and hash distribution are natural fits for the balls and bins model. There are also a lot of applications that aren't obviously analogous to the balls and bins model, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/showciting?cid=1042246&quot;&gt;circuit routing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.cmu.edu/math/mathcolloquium.php?SeminarSelect=522&quot;&gt;Erdős–Rényi&lt;/a&gt; graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Muscle memory discovery ends &amp;#039;use it or lose it&amp;#039; dogma</title>
<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190125084106.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190125084106.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;The old adage &quot;use it or lose it&quot; tells us: if you stop using your muscles, they'll shrink. Until recently, scientists thought this meant that nuclei -- the cell control centers that build and maintain muscle fibers -- are also lost to sloth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;125&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to a review published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, modern lab techniques now allow us to see that nuclei gained during training persist even when muscle cells shrink due to disuse or start to break down. These residual 'myonuclei' allow more and faster growth when muscles are retrained -- suggesting that we can &quot;bank&quot; muscle growth potential in our teens to prevent frailty in old age. It also suggests that athletes who cheat and grow their muscles with steroids may go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our biggest cells are in our muscles, and they're all fused together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncytium. Sounds like a neo-noir comic book series. It's actually a special type of tissue in your body, where cells are fused together extra close -- so close, that they behave a like a giant single cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Heart, bone and even placenta are built on these networks of cells,&quot; says Lawrence Schwartz, Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts. &quot;But by far our biggest cells -- and biggest syncytia -- are our muscles.&quot; Like the Sin City series, it appeared at first that everything was black and white with syncytia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Muscle growth is accompanied by the addition of new nuclei from stem cells to help meet the enhanced synthetic demands of larger muscle cells,&quot; explains Schwartz. &quot;This led to the assumption that a given nucleus controls a defined volume of cytoplasm -- so that when a muscle shrinks or 'atrophies' due to disuse or disease, the number of myonuclei decreases.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A muscle can gain nuclei, but never loses them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption long seemed valid, with many researchers reporting the presence of disintegrating nuclei in muscle tissue during atrophy induced by inactivity, injury or paralysis. But modern cell-type-specific dyes and genetic markers have shown that the dying nuclei other researchers had detected were in fact inflammatory and other cells recruited to atrophic muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new evidence paints a very different picture of muscle syncytium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two independent studies -- one in rodents and the other in insects -- have demonstrated that nuclei are not lost from atrophying muscle fibers, and even remain after muscle death has been initiated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggest that once a nucleus has been acquired by a muscle fiber, it belongs to the muscle syncytium -- probably for life. But Schwartz, for one, is unsurprised by the new findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Muscles get damaged during extreme exercise, and often have to weather changes in food availability and other environmental factors that lead to atrophy. They wouldn't last very long giving up their nuclei in response to every one of these insults.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Use it or lose it -- until you use it again&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since myonuclei are the synthetic engine of muscle fibers, retaining them should enable muscle size and strength to recover more quickly after one of these insults, and help to explain the phenomenon of 'muscle memory'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is well documented in the field of exercise physiology that it is far easier to reacquire a certain level of muscle fitness through exercise than it was to achieve it the first place, even if there has been a long intervening period of detraining. In other word, the phrase &quot;use it or lose it&quot; is might be more accurately articulated as 'use it or lose it, until you work at it again'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the findings have important implications beyond understanding muscle biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Informing public health policy, the discovery that myonuclei are retained indefinitely emphasizes the importance of exercise in early life. During adolescence muscle growth is enhanced by hormones, nutrition and a robust pool of stem cells, making it an ideal period for individuals to &quot;bank&quot; myonuclei that could be drawn upon to remain active in old age.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also support frequent drugs testing for competitive athletes, with permanent bans for proven steroid cheats since they will benefit from the steroids long after their use has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anabolic steroids produce a permanent increase in users' capacity for muscle development. In keeping with this, studies show that mice given testosterone acquire new myonuclei that persist long after the steroid use ends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Muscle memory discovery ends 'use it or lose it' dogma</og:title>

<og:description>Exercise physiologists agree: muscle memory is real. But how are these 'memories' stored? A review has a simple answer: nuclei gained during training persist even when muscle cells shrink due to disuse or start to break down. This means we can 'bank' nuclei in our youth to prevent frailty in old age -- and makes steroid use in competitive sport a perfect but irredeemable crime.</og:description>

<title>LD_PRELOAD: The Hero We Need and Deserve</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;LD_PRELOAD: The Hero We Need and Deserve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday, February 17, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge, HUGE, fan of &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; let me tell you… oh wait it’s my blog so I’m going to. Where do I begin…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three years ago, I wrote a blog post about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/top-10-favorite-ldflags/&quot;&gt;10 &lt;code&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; I love&lt;/a&gt;. After writing the post, I realized I should have made the number odd because I think that is part of BuzzFeed’s “click algorithm.” But more seriously, I realized just how many people on the internet you can upset when you don’t include &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; in your favorite &lt;code&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; post. I am going to take the time right now to make one thing very clear, VERY CLEAR, listen closely: &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; IS NOT A FLAG. It is an environment variable. Wake up sheeple! Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that’s out of the way, we can continue… I love &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;. I love it so much I am devoting this entire blog post to professing my undying love for it. So here we go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know what &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1053/&quot;&gt;TODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; allows you to override symbols in any library by specifying your new function in a shared object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/my/free.so /bin/mybinary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/path/to/my/free.so&lt;/code&gt; is loaded &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; any other library, including libc. When &lt;code&gt;mybinary&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it uses your custom function for &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;. PRETTY FREAKING AWESOME RIGHT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/img/kronk.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kronk&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FEEL THE POWER! Okay, so moving on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-times-on-the-internet&quot;&gt;Fun Times on the Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, I’m just hanging around in my apartment, laying on my couch, and I think “oh I’m going to ask the Internet what they’ve done with &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;.” This is how most of my tweets start for what it’s worth. So I asked…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.3879781420765&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;yo internet nerds, tell me all the ways you've done dirty things with LD_PRELOAD…. I need them…. for… science…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t all of them but isn’t the internet utterly awesome! You can poke through the thread more and find ones you love as well. But let’s move on to some mad science…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;science&quot;&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;&gt;Incubus album&lt;/a&gt;… but my science experiment that I did with &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;. My friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grepory&quot;&gt;@grepory&lt;/a&gt;, and I came up with this absolutely insane idea for “kernelless”. Yeah, it’s a joke making fun of all the other “-less”s. But ours was special, m’kay. He even made a dope website for it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernelless.cloud/&quot;&gt;kernelless.cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the way we were going to implement this in a mad science way would be as “Cloud Native Syscalls.” Let me tell you about the “Cloud Native Syscalls”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloud-native-syscalls&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Syscalls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the “Cloud Native Syscalls” architecture consists of a daemon on a cloud VM which has a network endpoint accepting incoming syscalls and their arguments. The daemon then performs these syscalls, almost in a code execution as a service type way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use “Cloud Native Syscalls”, you compile your binary with the library as follows: &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/my/cloudnativesyscalls.so /bin/ls&lt;/code&gt;. This ensures that all your syscalls when you run &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;em&gt;your host&lt;/em&gt; are actually performed in the cloud and sent to the daemon described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/img/nuts.gif&quot; alt=&quot;nuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F’king nuts right… I know. We are working on our A-round don’t worry. It’s truly revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that was our little science experiment. Hope you liked it, or at least enjoyed all the other people’s fun hacks. :) Keep &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;ing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Hey everyone,

After many months of hard work, Roopesh, Eric, and I are pleased to
announce an initial version of WireGuard for macOS:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=12&quot;&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=12&lt;/a&gt;

This is built from the same code base as our existing iOS app and
makes use of Apple's Network Extension API to provide native
integration into the operating system's networking stack. The
application lives in the status bar, and after importing a
configuration, the ordinary System Preferences networking item may
also be used to control each tunnel. Because it uses these deep
integration APIs, we're only allowed to distribute the application
using the macOS App Store (whose rejections, appeals, and eventual
acceptance made for quite the stressful saga over the last week and a
half). Compared to the current CLI integration, we expect the
WireGuard experience using this app to be excellent.

For curious folks without a Mac (or without the patience to cajole KVM
into booting macOS), I've assembled a few screenshots:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.zx2c4.com/wireguard-for-macos-screenshots-february-2019/&quot;&gt;https://data.zx2c4.com/wireguard-for-macos-screenshots-february-2019/&lt;/a&gt;

This is new software, and there will certainly be problems. Don't
hesitate to email &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/mailman/listinfo/wireguard&quot;&gt;team at wireguard.com&lt;/a&gt; directly with bugs as you
encounter them.

Enjoy!

Regards,
Jason

PS: Because people will inevitably ask: yes, a Windows client is on
its way, and it will have a very similar interface to this macOS one.
We're taking the long and careful route, writing a new TUN driver for
Windows 7+ called &quot;Wintun&quot; that we expect to be safer and faster than
the current popular OpenVPN TUN driver, and also suitable for all
projects, not just for WireGuard. We already have packets flowing and
things generally work well, but polish will require a bit of patience.
If you'd like to help and have an appetite for NDIS drivers, Win32 GUI
programming, or Go, please do get in touch.
&lt;/pre&gt;

<title>On Being an Engineering Manager</title>
<link>https://nickmchardy.com/2019/02/on-being-an-engineering-manager.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nickmchardy.com/2019/02/on-being-an-engineering-manager.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been acting in the role of Engineering Manager for 6 months now, so it’s a good time to review how things are going. Some of the points below could be obvious to some and not everything will work in all situations, but I hope I can accurately describe my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of background for you, first, to set the scene. The organisation I work for had endured several restructures over the past few years, but the most recent one was probably the most impactful for me. For the first time, I had the option of acting in a people management role as an Engineering Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, most of my roles for the past few years at this organisation and prior have revolved around solution designer or architect. I was used to communicating with many different stakeholder groups and providing technical leadership, even if I didn’t realise it. The area where I’ve worked the past 4 years has been tasked with developing and supporting all kinds of online and digital platforms and products, so the core function of our division hasn’t really changed significantly. We’ve weathered a few name changes along the way, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements of the most recent restructure was to remove the need to fund and run initiatives as &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt;, and instead, run as long-lived &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt;. This strategy is still in the process of coming to fruition (I think I heard some people say we’re still in the ‘storming’ phase, which I think is accurate). Read more about running teams as products in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickmchardy.com/2018/12/doing-products-instead-of-projects.html&quot;&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, a new set of 6 Engineering Managers was appointed, of which half were acting. I was one of the 3 people to gain an acting position, which is definitely a promotion from my previous roles. I thought I’d give the role a go, especially when combined with decent support from senior management as I would be learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my organisaton, an Engineering Manager is someone who manages an engineering team, comprised of developers, quality assurance (testers), build &amp;amp; operations and solution designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons I agreed to take up the role was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d never experienced people management and would like to pick up a new set of skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I knew pretty much everyone in the division, so I was in a reasonable position to ‘get things done’ with the support and respect of my peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s an &lt;em&gt;acting&lt;/em&gt; position, so I wouldn’t be stuck in it if I didn’t like it (I worked to define my substantive position, in case I wasn’t successful in becoming an officially appointed Engineering Manager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d be managing staff who look after 4 key platform areas: Analytics, Search, Identity Management and Content Recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4 platforms I was already intimately across since I’d either built it, designed it or procured it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Engineering Manager positions were interesting because we have a reasonable number of engineers, but few &lt;em&gt;managers&lt;/em&gt;. So, I would pick up 13 direct reports (which is a lot for a newbie!) and others would have up to 35 direct reports. Looking at the numbers alone, managing 13 people was a bit daunting, but in reality not everyone is a full-time employee. I have a mix of full-time, fixed-term contract and day-rate contract. Each style of employment has a differing requirement, from performance management and development plans, to contract renewal processes, and finally approving timesheeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the new processes which I had never been in before included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approving leave, travel and expense claims (to a limit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance management, job plans, individual development plans and appraisals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-on-1 meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timesheeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budgeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… and sometimes receiving bad news when people decide to move on (not to give anyone ideas, of course!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-blood-my-poor-calendar&quot;&gt;First blood: my poor calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role has always been dominated by an &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; calendar, which I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickmchardy.com/2018/08/why-i-openly-share-my-calendar-across-the-whole-org-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; before also. I say incredible, but really it’s often 7 hours of meetings a day. I do say “at least you get paid to be in meetings” but sometimes it can be too much. There’s simply no time between meetings to achieve something to talk about in the next meeting. I have a habit of being double and triple booked, even with an open calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my calendar already being so packed, I decided that one thing I wanted to do was proper 1-on-1’s with each member of my team. This means running them every fortnight, for up to an hour, where I would try to listen to my team more than me doing the talking. To make this time more valuable, I have been taking notes in a diary, with an entry for each 1-on-1 session, with clear actions in a page that’s shared with the individual. One reason is that I can’t possibly remember everything, but also as I’ve only been ‘acting’, I could use it as a source to handover my team to someone else, should I need it. Also, with my team member’s approval of this! Nothing super confidential is written in the page, because others &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have admin access privileges and thus can read it, so I do exercise caution for this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be booking 13 x 1 hour sessions a fortnight, plus several daily standups, plus 2 x weekly 1 hour management meetings. This basically halves the amount of time you have to spend on anything else. Yowch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can be a bit smarter about 1-on-1s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don’t need to use the full hour if your team member doesn’t need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If things come up or if the recurring meeting falls on a public holiday, you should always reschedule and at least give the option to be available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can go for a walk. Yes! Outside! Be creative, it doesn’t always have to be a talk-fest in a meeting room (I remember going to pick up a package from the post office, chatting to one of my team members)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-learnt&quot;&gt;What I learnt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I quickly discovered was that I really enjoy the technical aspects of my previous roles. I still enjoy dabbling in a bit of code here and there, just to stay sharp. It’s one of my strategies to make sure I still know what I’m talking about (or at least I try!). That’s also one of the reasons why, outside of my real job, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.purpletoaster.com&quot;&gt;other projects&lt;/a&gt; on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the Engineering Manager position is described is a pure people management role. It’s all about developing a great engineering team, without having to do any of the technical work yourself. This poses the question for many senior technical people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When’s the right time to give up the tools and become a people manager?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of organisations have a well-defined technical track separate from a dedicated people track, which is usually split once you get to a high enough level. On the technical side, this is less defined in my organisation, however we’re still working through how this can work with roles like Lead Engineer and Principal Engineer. I think for a lot of us, making this decision is quite a tough one because often once you hit a certain level of technical mastery, outside of learning a new language or technology, it’s difficult to progress further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being labelled a ‘&lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt;’ for the first time was also an interesting experience, which took people a while to get used to. Actually, it even took &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; some time to get used to as well! I can’t remember any time when anyone wasn’t supportive of the new role, so that definitely made the transition easier for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came time to apply for the role about half-way through my time as an Engineering Manager, so with 3 months experience, I had to make a decision. Would I apply for the role? Would I have a chance in being successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-did-i-decide&quot;&gt;So what did I decide?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went the technical route and chose &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to apply for the Engineering Manager role. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of time to think about it and I can promise I didn’t just take the lazy option because I didn’t want to update my resume and apply for the job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few reasons that had me convinced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had so little time for doing things like drawing diagrams (something that I actually really enjoy) or coding bits here and there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed working across multiple solutions and products and wanted to ensure this continued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a strong depth of technical understanding, having been here for over 4 years, that it’s easy to make decisions with confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And this is the biggest one: I actually think with my skills, the organisation is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; off with me as a Solution Designer/Architect. We actually really need someone to fill this role, to tie a lot of the systems together, to bring that knowledge to make sure we are technically aligned and things aren’t missed or repeated in a way which wastes resources. So I could actually ensure the Solution Architect role continued by not applying for the Engineering Manager role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the organisation you work for might need you to do a certain role for a strategic reason, but remember: it is your life and your career, so it has to work for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as much as it has to work for the organisation. I believe I can achieve this balance with my substantive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping to develop people is tough! But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Fixing problems with a system or a computer is a lot easier (at least for me) than solving people’s problems. Understanding all of the nuances and complexities of a person can be a challenge, but it’s quite rewarding when you have a motivated and performing team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re given the opportunity to have a hand in managing people, by all means give it a go! You don’t really begin to comprehend what’s involved until you’ve tried. There are times when I actually find the management role to be very satisfying: when you can resolve people’s issues and you can make a real impact to someone’s career. It’s a noble role and does take great skill to be a supportive and effective leader. I’m not there yet, but maybe one day I will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-realised-about-being-technical&quot;&gt;What I realised about being ‘technical’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a technical person who’s been around involves more leadership than you realise. Unknowingly, I actually really enjoy aspects of leadership when it comes to achieving an outcome with a solid approach. This may include influencing people to bring them on board, as much as also learning from others all the time. Just because I’d like to focus on seemingly more technical outcomes doesn’t mean I don’t need to continue to develop soft skills on how to empathise, analyse, communicate and influence others. There’s a huge gap if you can invent the best solution given all kinds of constraints (time, people, skills, budget, performance, accessibility, legislation, policy, you name it) and you can’t get anyone else on board with your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found I enjoy working closely with engineers - to the point of me standing up for the voice of the engineer - to make sure the team members who are doing the hard work are actually valued. It’s difficult to move things forward without the engineering community. This has many dynamics to it and it’s not always about sitting down in a work scenario to review code or walk through a solution design. It could be as simple as going to lunch with the team or making time to play boardgames. Mutual respect is an important power which is often overlooked when organisational “progress” takes the focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some approaches which I find work for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like to share the solution and talk about it being “ours” or “we came up with it” rather than saying it’s mine. This is a reflection of truth not a façade because I would involve teams along the way as the solution is defined and developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focus on building sustainable solutions goes a long way if you’re planning on staying in an organisation for a long time: you don’t want to be leaving a scorched earth of technical debt as you jump from project to project and keeping operational teams engaged is paramount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being across many things at once comes with it’s challenges, but it means you can be more effective in decision making because you understand more context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straddling both senior management and engineering teams equally can be challenging but is rewarding because you’ll need most people on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being open and sharing in thought with lots of documentation (even if it’s a work in progress) helps to build integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-brings-me-to-today&quot;&gt;This brings me to today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m still acting as an Engineering Manager, holding the fort until the recruitment process is completed. I’m still happy to continue in this role in an acting capacity, because I have a great team who work on some pretty cool products and platforms. I’m still looking forward to getting some more time to draw the next diagram of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I couldn’t help myself)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Flightradar24 – how it works</title>
<link>https://habr.com/en/post/440596/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://habr.com/en/post/440596/</guid>
<description>I’m going to hazard a guess and say that everyone whose friends or family have ever flown on a plane, have used Flightradar24 — a free and convenient service for tracking flights in real time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/xg/eo/t-/xgeot-h18b94ucc-fiuc46iotvm.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if my friends are any indication, very few people know that the service is community-driven and is supported by a group of enthusiasts gathering and sending data. Even fewer people know that anyone can join the project — including you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how Flightradar and similar other services works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first question is always “where the data comes from”.&lt;p&gt;Every civilian airliner is equipped with a special device — the so-caller ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) transponder, on the photo, is a box with a «1200» label on it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/uu/oj/s8/uuojs839h2_px4ritjoebq3hpba.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;(photo from Garmin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transponder sends various flight telemetry — airplane type, its coordinates, destination etc, using the 1090MHz unencrypted radio frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how the signal looks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/si/ie/vl/siievlzltcdogtaxpycoxcdvqqw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is a data structure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/ig/uj/muigujxudctclwalfdxl5tzzdam.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal is transmitting with a high speed 1MB/s, so it takes only 0.00012sec to transmit the data, in the speaker we can hear only a very short 'click', if we'll try to listen this. But with the proper hardware the signal is very easy to decode. All we need is an RTL-SDR receiver (that costs around $15) connected to a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is pretty clear by that point — if you have a lot of receivers and gather data from all of them, you can see this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/x4/4n/b0/x44nb02m30-zigckoseo6lnlwam.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all. Some planes transmit telemetry packets without GPS coordinates. But if you receive data from a lot of planes that do broadcast their location, then you can triangulate the position of the unknown aircraft by analyzing ping delays from different receivers. The technology is called multilateration (MLAT) and you can learn more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/how-we-track-flights-with-mlat/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the last question — how do this services actually receiving the data. With the equipment being pretty cheap (from $50 to downright free), anyone can send it. Flightradar is not publishing their coverage, but we can see the receivers map of another 'competitor' service — Flightaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/pi/41/wnpi416dssxcdzkiz7cr0_owg7s.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, some countries are covered very sparsely, so some contributions can actually make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;To set it up you need:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi2/3 with an Internet connection (starting at $20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTL-SDR dongle (from $15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple antenna made from 2 wires 6.8cm each (1090MHz 1/4 wave dipole).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You would want to set everything up in a place with clear view of at least part of the sky, since signals of that high of a frequency get absorbed by things like houses or trees.&lt;p&gt;I already had both the Raspberry Pi and the dongle, so I was ready right away, but Flightradar and Flightaware actually send kits &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt; to users, from locations they don’t have good coverage of. Everybody can send a request &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightradar24.com/apply-for-receiver&quot;&gt;to Flightradar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.flightaware.com/adsb/request&quot;&gt;to the Flightaware&lt;/a&gt;, though obviously people from remote areas have a higher chance of approval. But my personal opinion, that its better to have &lt;em&gt;own receiver&lt;/em&gt;, and to be free to do what you want, to send data to any service, you want, and so on (there are some limitations for people who got receiver for free, as example, they cannot send data from it to a competitor service). And 20-30$ is not such a big value anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the RTL-SDR V3-based kit from China, which came with an antenna and a mini-stand. It cost me $27 with free shipping, for all this stuff:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/e8/_p/he/e8_pheirzkeetsraqdwqmt3ulnc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, as another incentive to encourage people to join, Flightradar24 and Flightaware offer &lt;strong&gt;free premium accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, unlocking all of the website’s functionality (that normally costs $50 a month). So if anyone really gets a lot out of the service, installing the receiver lets you use it much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Installation is pretty easy. You just need to connect Raspberry Pi to a receiver and execute this prompt:&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo bash -c &quot;$(wget -O - http://repo.feed.flightradar24.com/install_fr24_rpi.sh)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It will request the data necesary (coordinate, receiver type, email address) and then the software works on its own — no further action from the user needed. Once that’s done, you can set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightradar24.com/premium/signup?account=free&quot;&gt;premium account here&lt;/a&gt; and immediately get to use premium functionality.&lt;p&gt;If you go to the Raspberry Pi’s IP address, you’ll see its status:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/ns/iz/consizpsres1pcdz8qqpt2inmdk.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flightradar’s account page reveals a lot more information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/m7/zw/8w/m7zw8wq87hyuox4shue_jq1wne0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live on the 6th floor of a building near the airport, so even my simple antenna mounted near the window, caught almost 1000 planes in a day. And its range seemed to be around 215 miles — again, not bad for a setup that cheap. Various setups could be found on Ebay, just search “ads-b antenna”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternative solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Bonus for those whose attention span is long enough to reach that point. Some readers might ask — is there a way to avoid third-party services like Flightradar entirely? Of course there is — you can run the decoder on the Raspberry Pi locally. The source code is published on github (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antirez/dump1090&quot;&gt;https://github.com/antirez/dump1090&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;All you need is to enter these 3 commands:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/antirez/dump1090.git
cd dump1090/
make&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;And then launch the decoder:&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./dump1090 --interactive --net&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The decoder gets to work, and we see “raw data” — a list of visible planes:&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/7n/2z/mn7n2zwpkfk724rpjtzsix_ndyo.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also log into the Raspberry Pi with a browser and see your own, local «Flightradar». It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/2w/va/kd2wvay_hy8_sohqwiohzd9qvdc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you need that? Well, just for thrills, but also Flightradar24 censors some of the data, not showing some of the planes (for example, military, government aircrafts or business jets). If you launch your own station, you see everything — even censored stuff, although your data set will be limited by your location and antenna quality, and you won’t have access to MLAT. Again, the source code mentioned above lets you create your own Flightradar, with blackjack and all the bells and whistles you would want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;As we can see, it’s an involving, inexpensive and rather simple experience. Just for comparison: 10 years the Airnav RadarBox receiver cost around $1000, now the RTL-SDR, that does exactly the same thing, can be had for $10.&lt;p&gt;In my case, the receiver didn’t have any practical purpose, since Flightrader’s coverage in Europe is nearly complete anyway. But those living in the wilderness can genuinely help out air travelers from all over the world, extend the coverage map and even get a premium account for your troubles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>You probably don&amp;#039;t need a single-page app</title>

<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-01-29&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;January 29, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meteoric rise of front-end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, Elm, etc. has made single-page applications ubiquitous on the web. For many developers, these have become part of their ‘default’ toolset. When they start a new project, they grab the tools they know already: a REST API on the backend, and a React/Angular/Vue/Elm frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something wrong with these tools? Absolutely not. In fact, I love working with them. However, I would only choose this architecture when an actual requirement is pushing me in that direction. If there are no specific reasons to build a single-page application, I will go with a traditional server-rendered architecture every day of the week. It is simpler and allows you to move faster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.299712849964&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional web servers are built to be stateless. This means that each endpoint can be reasoned about and tested in isolation. SPAs, by contrast, have to explicitly define how all state is loaded, refreshed, and discarded by the frontend during the whole session. This introduces new caching/synchronization problems that just don’t exist in the server-rendered world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The browser knows how to deal with a traditional architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you go with the SPA route, you’ll always need extra code to emulate trivial browser features. I’ve spent many hours making sure that browser history is managed just right, that the loading animation looks smooth, restoring the scroll position when the user navigates through history, etc. It’s a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10.507462686567&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer, more mature tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frameworks like Rails, Phoenix, Laravel, etc. have been around for a while and they are very stable. I learned Rails about 5 years ago and my knowledge is still completely relevant. Around the same time, I also learned Gulp, CoffeeScript, BackboneJS, and SASS, all of which have been superseded by newer tools. Avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4&quot;&gt;Javascript fatigue&lt;/a&gt; by not relying so much on Javascript!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-page apps have to add extra infrastructure and code to make sure they can be indexed by crawlers. If you need SEO on your dynamic pages, it’s much easier to accomplish with a server-rendered architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that single-page applications impose more complexity and cognitive load on the developers. In my experience as a developer, complexity and cognitive load are the single biggest factors in software bugs and development slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-go-for-the-single-page-app_3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://journal.plausible.io/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app#when-to-go-for-the-single-page-app_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;When to go for the single page app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, the default choice in most cases should be the traditional server-rendered application. However, there are some requirements that might &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; you to opt for the single-page application architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core functionality is real-time (e.g Slack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich UI interactions are core to the product (e.g Trello)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of state shared between screens (e.g. Spotify)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products absolutely have to use a single-page architecture to work properly. This is why it’s the right choice for these companies. However, many web-based products do not have these requirements and this complexity can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hybrid-solutions_3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://journal.plausible.io/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app#hybrid-solutions_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Hybrid solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your app needs some real-time capabilities or rich interactions, you don’t need to use the SPA paradigm for your whole app. A great approach is to embed small frontend applications into a traditional architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github uses this hybrid approach. The backbone of their website is a traditional rails app but some areas, like the projects tab, are built as embedded frontend applications. It’s a beautiful solution that combines the best of both worlds. The great thing is that you can start simple and gradually add more complex UI interactions with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that my current project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plausible.io/&quot;&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt;, will evolve in this direction. The main UI of the app will need rich interactions in the future, but the rest of the app can stay with the server-rendered architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with everything in programming, there isn’t a single answer in the SPA vs traditional architecture dilemma. There are cases where it makes sense to go with a SPA because you need a snappy, real-time UI. However, we should recognize that this comes at a cost to the development speed. And if a single-page app is not a requirement, we can avoid the additional complexity and move much quicker by going the traditional route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking the right architecture for the job makes a huge difference in productivity, and ultimately, success. We should aim to have both architectures in our toolbox, so we can use the optimal solution in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hexagonal Grids (2013)</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;coordinates&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;Coordinate Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's assemble hexagons into a grid. With square grids, there's one obvious way to do it. With hexagons, there are multiple approaches. I like cube coordinates for algorithms and axial or doubled for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinates-offset&quot;&gt;Offset coordinates&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-offset&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common approach is to offset every other column or row. Columns are named &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;). Rows are named &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;). You can either offset the odd or the even column/rows, so the horizontal and vertical hexagons each have two variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 61, 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 62, 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 63, 03, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 64, 04, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 65, 05, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 66, 06, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 6 “odd-r” horizontal layout&lt;br/&gt;shoves odd rows right0, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 61, 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 62, 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 63, 03, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 64, 04, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 65, 05, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 66, 06, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 6 “even-r” horizontal layout&lt;br/&gt;shoves even rows right0, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 51, 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 52, 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 53, 03, 13, 23, 33, 43, 54, 04, 14, 24, 34, 44, 55, 05, 15, 25, 35, 45, 56, 06, 16, 26, 36, 46, 57, 07, 17, 27, 37, 47, 5 “odd-q” vertical layout&lt;br/&gt;shoves odd columns down0, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 51, 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 52, 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 53, 03, 13, 23, 33, 43, 54, 04, 14, 24, 34, 44, 55, 05, 15, 25, 35, 45, 56, 06, 16, 26, 36, 46, 57, 07, 17, 27, 37, 47, 5 “even-q” vertical layout&lt;br/&gt;shoves even columns down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;30.885880077369&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at hexagonal grids is to see that there are &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; primary axes, unlike the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; we have for square grids. There's an elegant symmetry with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a cube grid and &lt;strong&gt;slice&lt;/strong&gt; out a diagonal plane at &lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; = 0&lt;/code&gt;. This is a &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; idea but it helps us make hex grid algorithms simpler. In particular, we can reuse standard operations from cartesian coordinates: adding coordinates, subtracting coordinates, multiplying or dividing by a scalar, and distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the three six hex grid directions are halfway between two of the cube axes. We'll see this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#neighbors&quot;&gt;neighbors&lt;/a&gt; section, where moving along one of the six hex grid directions involves changing &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; of the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we already have algorithms for square and cube grids, using cube coordinates allows us to adapt those algorithms to hex grids. I will be using this system for most of the algorithms on the page. To use the algorithms with another coordinate system, I'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#conversions&quot;&gt;convert to cube coordinates&lt;/a&gt;, run the algorithm, and convert back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
+z-x+y-z+x-y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;button&gt;Switch to hexagons&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-container&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study how the cube coordinates work on the hex grid. Selecting the hexes will highlight the cube coordinates corresponding to the three axes.&lt;/p&gt;
-30+3-3+1+2-3+2+1-3+30-2-1+3-20+2-2+1+1-2+20-2+3-1-1-2+3-1-1+2-10+1-1+10-1+2-1-1+3-20-3+30-2+20-1+1xzy0+1-10+2-20+3-3+1-3+2+1-2+1+1-10+10-1+1+1-2+1+2-3+2-3+1+2-20+2-1-1+20-2+2+1-3+3-30+3-2-1+3-1-2+30-3 +x +z +y -x -z -y flat pointy&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each direction on the cube grid corresponds to a &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; on the hex grid. Try highlighting a hex with &lt;code class=&quot;z-axis&quot;&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; at 0, 1, 2, 3 to see how these are related. The row is marked in blue. Try the same for &lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (green) and &lt;code class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; (purple).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each direction on the hex grid is a combination of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; directions on the cube grid. For example, &lt;span class=&quot;orientation-northwest-north&quot;&gt;northwest&lt;/span&gt; on the hex grid lies between the &lt;code class=&quot;y-axis&quot;&gt;+y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;z-axis&quot;&gt;-z&lt;/code&gt;, so every step &lt;span class=&quot;orientation-northwest-north&quot;&gt;northwest&lt;/span&gt; involves adding 1 to &lt;code class=&quot;y-axis&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and subtracting 1 from &lt;code class=&quot;z-axis&quot;&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cube coordinates are a reasonable choice for a hex grid coordinate system. The constraint is that &lt;code&gt;x + y + z = 0&lt;/code&gt; so the algorithms must preserve that. The constraint also ensures that there's a canonical coordinate for each hex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; different valid cube hex coordinate systems. Some of them have constraints other than &lt;code&gt;x + y + z = 0&lt;/code&gt;. I've shown only one of the many systems. You can also construct cube coordinates with &lt;code&gt;x-y, y-z, z-x&lt;/code&gt;, and that has its own set of interesting properties, which I don't explore here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But Amit!&quot; you say, &quot;I don't want to store 3 numbers for coordinates. I don't know how to store a map that way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-container&quot; readability=&quot;23.790087463557&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.96062992126&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinates-axial&quot;&gt;Axial coordinates&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The axial coordinate system, sometimes called “trapezoidal” or “oblique” or “skewed”, is built by taking two of the three coordinates from a cube coordinate system. Since we have a constraint &lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; = 0&lt;/code&gt;, there's some redundancy, and we don't need to store all three coordinates. This diagram is the same as the previous one, except I don't show &lt;code class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
-30-3+1-3+2-3+3-2-1-20-2+1-2+2-2+3-1-2-1-1-10-1+1-1+2-1+30-30-20-1qr0+10+20+3+1-3+1-2+1-1+10+1+1+1+2+2-3+2-2+2-1+20+2+1+3-3+3-2+3-1+30 +q +r -q -r flat pointy&lt;div readability=&quot;26.642599277978&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many choices of cube coordinate system, and many choices of axial coordinate system. I'm not going to show all of the combinations in this guide. I've chosen &lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; for &quot;column&quot; = &lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;row&quot; = &lt;code class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;. This choice is arbitary, as you can rotate and flip the diagrams to make many different assignments of ±x,±y,±z to q,r.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this system over offset grids is that the algorithms are cleaner when you can use add, subtract, multiply, and divide on hex coordinates. The disadvantage of this system is that storing a rectangular map is a little weird; see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage&quot;&gt;map storage&lt;/a&gt; section for ways to handle that. In my projects, I name the axes &lt;code class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; so that I have the constraint &lt;code&gt;q + r + s = 0&lt;/code&gt;, and then I can calculate &lt;code&gt;s = -q - r&lt;/code&gt; when I need the third coordinate for algorithms that work better with cube coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinates-doubled&quot;&gt;Doubled coordinates&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-doubled&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-container&quot; readability=&quot;122.21254355401&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I recommend axial/cube coordinates, if you are sticking to offset coordinates, consider the doubled variant. It makes many of the algorithms easier to implement. Instead of alternation, the doubled coordinates &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; either the horizontal or vertical step size. It has a constraint &lt;code&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;) % 2 == 0&lt;/code&gt;. In the horizontal (pointy top hex) layout it increases the column by 2 each hex; in the vertical (flat top hex) layout it increases the row by 2 each hex. This allows the in-between values for the hexes that are halfway in between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't found much information about this system — tri-bit.com called it &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20090205120106/http://sc.tri-bit.com/Hex_Grids&quot;&gt;interlaced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;print-endnote&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;, rot.js calls it &lt;a href=&quot;http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/manual/#hex/indexing&quot;&gt;double width&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;print-endnote&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235779843_Storage_and_addressing_scheme_for_practical_hexagonal_image_processing?_sg=flKEA6rk1KmOpC4LBjQJN_-NBuiR1KJtJt-XeYRXnd0z_MNUrB2gjb2FKV3iBoKg988P2xHCpQ&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;print-endnote&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; calls it rectangular.

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation: if you are only going to use rectangular maps, and never rotate the map, consider the doubled or offset coordinates, as they will line up with your map better than axial or cube. In all other cases, use axial as the primary system, and calculate the third cube coordinate only for those algorithms where cube is easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a hex, which 6 hexes are neighboring it? As you might expect, the answer is simplest with cube coordinates, still pretty simple with axial coordinates, and slightly trickier with offset coordinates. We might also want to calculate the 6 “diagonal” hexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving one space in hex coordinates involves changing one of the 3 cube coordinates by +1 and changing another one by -1 (the sum must remain 0). There are 3 possible coordinates to change by +1, and 2 remaining that could be changed by -1. This results in 6 possible changes. Each corresponds to one of the hexagonal directions. The simplest and fastest approach is to precompute the permutations and put them into a table of &lt;code&gt;Cube(dx, dy, dz)&lt;/code&gt; at compile time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With offset coordinates, the change depends on where in the grid we are. If we're on an offset column/row then the rule is different than if we're on a non-offset column/row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above, we'll build a table of the numbers we need to add to &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt;. However offset coordinates can't be safely added and subtracted. Instead, the results are different for odd and even columns/rows, so we will need two separate lists of neighbors. Look at &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; on the grid map above and see how &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; change as you move in each of the six directions. Then do this again for &lt;code&gt;(2,2)&lt;/code&gt;. The tables and code are different for each of the four offset grid types, so &lt;strong&gt;pick a grid type&lt;/strong&gt; to see the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above lookup tables is the easiest way to to calculate neighbors. It's also possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/derive-hex-neighbor-formula.html&quot;&gt;derive these numbers&lt;/a&gt;, for those of you who are curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike offset coordinates, the neighbors for doubled coordinates do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; depend on which column/row we're on. They're the same everywhere, like axial and cube coordinates. Also unlike offset coordinates, we can safely add and subtract doubled coordinates, which makes them easier to work with than offset coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions is, how do I take a pixel location (such as a mouse click) and convert it into a hex grid coordinate? I'll show how to do this for axial or cube coordinates. For offset coordinates, the simplest thing to do is to convert the cube to offset at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First we &lt;em&gt;invert&lt;/em&gt; the hex to pixel conversion. This will give us a &lt;em&gt;fractional&lt;/em&gt; hex coordinate, shown as a small red circle in the diagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we find the hex containing the fractional hex coordinate, shown as the highlighted hex in the diagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To convert from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#hex-to-pixel&quot;&gt;hex coordinates to pixel coordinates&lt;/a&gt;, we multiplied &lt;code&gt;q, r&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;em&gt;basis vectors&lt;/em&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;x, y&lt;/code&gt;. This was a matrix multiply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To invert the hex-to-pixel process into a pixel-to-hex process we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=inv+%7B%7Bsqrt%283%29%2C+sqrt%283%29%2F2%7D%2C+%7B0%2C+3%2F2%7D%7D&quot;&gt;invert the pointy-top hex-to-pixel matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;print-endnote&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;print-endnote&quot;&gt;[31]&lt;/sup&gt; into a pixel-to-hex matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;matrix float-right&quot;&gt;
⎡q⎤     ⎡ &lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;sqrt(3)/3     -1/3&lt;/span&gt; ⎤   ⎡x⎤
⎢ ⎥  =  ⎢                    ⎥ × ⎢ ⎥ ÷ size
⎣r⎦     ⎣     &lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;0          2/3&lt;/span&gt; ⎦   ⎣y⎦
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calculation will give us fractional axial coordinates (floats) for &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#rounding&quot;&gt;hex_round()&lt;/a&gt; function will convert the fractional axial coordinates into integer axial hex coordinates. Here's the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function pixel_to_pointy_hex(point):
    var q = (&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;sqrt(3)/3&lt;/span&gt; * point.x  -  &lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;1./3&lt;/span&gt; * point.y) / size
    var r = (                        &lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;2./3&lt;/span&gt; * point.y) / size
    return hex_round(Hex(q, r))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code for: &lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; value=&quot;flat&quot;/&gt;flat top&lt;/label&gt; or &lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; value=&quot;pointy&quot;/&gt;pointy top&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's three lines of code to convert a pixel location into an axial hex coordinate. If you use offset coordinates, use &lt;code&gt;return cube_to_{odd,even}{r,q}(cube_round(Cube(q, -q-r, r)))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other ways to convert pixel to hex; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/more-pixel-to-hex.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for the ones I know of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the common complaints about the axial coordinate system is that it leads to wasted space when using a rectangular map; that's one reason to favor an offset coordinate system. However all the hex coordinate systems lead to wasted space when using a triangular or hexagonal map. We can use the same strategies for storing all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice in the diagram that the wasted space is on the left and right sides of each row (except for rhombus maps) This gives us three strategies for storing the map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore&lt;/strong&gt; the problem. Use a dense array with nulls or some other sentinel at the unused spaces. At most there's a factor of two for these common shapes; it may not be worth using a more complicated solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;strong&gt;hash table&lt;/strong&gt; instead of dense array. This allows arbitrarily shaped maps, including ones with holes. When you want to access the hex at &lt;code&gt;q,r&lt;/code&gt; you access &lt;code&gt;hash_table(hash(&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt; instead. Encapsulate this into the getter/setter in a map class so that the rest of the game doesn't need to know about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slide&lt;/strong&gt; the rows to the left, by starting the arrays at the leftmost column instead of at 0. This removes the waste on the left. Optionally, use variable sized rows. In many languages a 2D array is an array of arrays; there's no reason the arrays have to be the same length. This removes the waste on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a closer look at how to use an array of arrays. There's an array for each row, but we need to know the first column of that row. Map hex &lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is stored at &lt;code&gt;array[&lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; - first_row][&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; - first_column(r)]&lt;/code&gt;. Encapsulate this into the getter/setter in a map class so that the rest of the game doesn't need to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the rectangle shaped map shown here, &lt;code&gt;first_column(r) == -floor(r/2)&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;Hex(q, r)&lt;/code&gt; is stored at &lt;code&gt;array[r][q + floor(r/2)]&lt;/code&gt;. This turns out to be equivalent to converting the coordinates into odd-r offset grid coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the triangle shaped map shown here, &lt;code&gt;first_column(r) == 0&lt;/code&gt;, so you'd access &lt;code&gt;array[r][q]&lt;/code&gt; — how convenient! For triangle shaped maps that are oriented the other way (not shown in the diagram), it's &lt;code&gt;array[r][q+r]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For hexagon shaped maps of radius &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; centered at Hex(N, N, -2*N), &lt;code&gt;first_column(r) == max(0, N-r)&lt;/code&gt;, so you'd access &lt;code&gt;array[r][q - max(0, N-r)]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the rhombus shaped map here, everything matches nicely, so you can use &lt;code&gt;array[r][q]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your maps won't look exactly like the ones here so you'll need to adapt &lt;code&gt;first_row&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;first_column(r)&lt;/code&gt; to your own maps. If you are using flat-topped hexes, it will be easier to swap the roles of the rows and columns, and use &lt;code&gt;array[&lt;span class=&quot;q&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; - first_column][&lt;span class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; - first_row(q)]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
