<title>MITM on HTTPS traffic in Kazakhstan</title>
<link>https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567114</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567114</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It would be ineffective. It worth nothing to government agencies to implement a spyware, having the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;retrieving a new root certificate from govenment servers and installing it into all browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doing other espionage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a root CA is rotated every 5 minutes, so users would heve to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;either download and install it manually every 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or install the spyware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or install a bit milder open-source version of spyware developed by enthusiasts in order to provide alternative to installing a full version. The milder version only rotates the sertificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a regular user would do? He would just install the spyware. In fact every user would do that because the alternative is not to use internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more effect this spyware may be Windows-only and Chrome-only in irder to discourage usage of the software respecting users privacy. This will cause further drop of Firefox market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other countermeasures are also ineffective. For example mozilla can create 2 different digitally signed builds of firefox, one is without possibility to insert root CAs and implement a feature: when browser detects that a user was blackmailed into installed a root CA the browser patches itself into the build disallowing installing root CAs. But again, it can be undone by blackmailing users into installing malware undoing the changes. Also I think that limiting freedom of users to change browser settings is inacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what you can really do is to preinstall a WebExtension having HTML files with information about Kazakh political parties and organizations opposing this and showing them on every startup and a zip of Tor + curl + minisign + bat file using other files to download Tor Browser Bundle and check its integrity. A user is instructed to save this file to desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also should coordinate this move with Google: Chrome should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I Could Have Hacked Any Instagram Account</title>
<link>https://thezerohack.com/hack-any-instagram</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thezerohack.com/hack-any-instagram</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is about how I found a vulnerability on Instagram that allowed me to hack any Instagram account without consent permission. Facebook and Instagram security team fixed the issue and rewarded me $30000 as a part of their bounty program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is working constantly to improve its security controls on all of their platforms. As a part of it, they recently increased reward payouts for all critical vulnerabilities including account takeovers. So I decided to try my luck on Facebook and Instagram. Fortunately, I was able to find one on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram forgot password endpoint is the first thing that came to my mind while looking for an account takeover vulnerability. I tried to reset my password on the Instagram web interface. They have a link based password reset mechanism which is pretty strong and I couldn’t find any bugs after a few minutes of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then switched to their mobile recovery flow, where I was able to find a susceptible behavior. When a user enters his/her mobile number, they will be sent a six-digit passcode to their mobile number. They have to enter it to change their password. Therefore if we are able to try all the one million codes on the verify-code endpoint, we would be able to change the password of any account. But I was pretty sure that there must be some rate limiting against such brute-force attacks. I decided to test it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tests did show the presence of rate limiting. I sent around 1000 requests, 250 of them went through and the rest 750 requests were rate limited. Tried another 1000, now many of them got rate limited. So their systems are validating and rate limiting the requests properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things that struck mind was the number of requests and the absence of blacklisting. I was able to send requests continuously without getting blocked even though the number of requests I can send in a fraction of time is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days of continuous testing, I found two things that allowed me to bypass their rate limiting mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Race Hazard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are unaware of race condition, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition&quot;&gt;read it here&lt;/a&gt;. Sending concurrent requests using multiple IPs allowed me to send a large number of requests without getting limited. The number of requests we can send is dependent on concurrency of reqs and the number of IPs we use. Also, I realized that the code expires in 10 minutes, it makes the attack even harder, therefore we need 1000s of IPs to perform the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported the vulnerability to the Facebook security team and they were unable to reproduce it initially due to lack of information in my report. After a few emails and solid proof of concept video, I was able to convince them that the attack is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of concept:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requesting passcode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;POST /api/v1/users/lookup/ HTTP/1.1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;User-Agent: Instagram 92.0.0.11.114 Android (27/8.1.0; 440dpi; 1080×2150; Xiaomi/xiaomi; Redmi Note 6 Pro; tulip; qcom; en_IN; 152830654)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accept-Language: en-IN, en-US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-&lt;wbr/&gt;urlencoded; charset=UTF-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.instagram.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://i.instagram.com&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1563213773245000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG9ZN4TA8Lt_oZKajdfvHWyeuoIZg&quot;&gt;i.instagram.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connection: keep-alive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;q=mobile_number&amp;amp;device_id=&lt;wbr/&gt;android-device-id-here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim will receive a passcode and it will expire in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify passcode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /api/v1/accounts/account_&lt;wbr/&gt;recovery_code_verify/ HTTP/1.1&lt;br/&gt;User-Agent: Instagram 92.0.0.11.114 Android (27/8.1.0; 440dpi; 1080×2150; Xiaomi/xiaomi; Redmi Note 6 Pro; tulip; qcom; en_IN; 152830654)&lt;br/&gt;Accept-Language: en-IN, en-US&lt;br/&gt;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-&lt;wbr/&gt;urlencoded; charset=UTF-8&lt;br/&gt;Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate&lt;br/&gt;Host: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.instagram.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://i.instagram.com&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1563213773245000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG9ZN4TA8Lt_oZKajdfvHWyeuoIZg&quot;&gt;i.instagram.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Connection: keep-alive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recover_code=123456&amp;amp;device_id=&lt;em&gt;android-device-id-here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to brute-force this endpoint using multiple IPs. Roughly, I was able to send 200 requests from a single IP without hitting rate limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used 1000 different machines (to achieve concurrency easily) and IPs to send 200k requests (that’s 20 percent of total one million probability) in my tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending 200k requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4O9FjTMlHUM&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a real attack scenario, the attacker needs 5000 IPs to hack an account. It sounds big but that’s actually easy if you use a cloud service provider like Amazon or Google. It would cost around 150 dollars to perform the complete attack of one million codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook security team was convinced after providing the above video of sending 200k valid requests. They were also quick in addressing and fixing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the patch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2600 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://thezerohack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bounty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bounty&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;https://thezerohack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bounty.jpg 625w, https://thezerohack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bounty-300x192.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px&quot;/&gt;$30000 USD Reward
&lt;p&gt;I thank Facebook security team for rewarding me through their bug bounty program. Let me know your thoughts in comments 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At what time of day do famous programmers work?</title>
<link>https://ivan.bessarabov.com/blog/famous-programmers-work-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ivan.bessarabov.com/blog/famous-programmers-work-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was curious when does the famous programmers do their work. And it is quite easy to find. The result of programmers work is a code. Code is stored in version control systems (VCS). When you put code in VCS the time is record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most popular version control system is git. When you put code in it you create the thing called &quot;commit&quot;. Here is an example of raw information about some git commit:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git cat-file commit 82be015
tree 496d6428b9cf92981dc9495211e6e1120fb6f2ba
author Ivan Bessarabov &amp;lt;ivan@bessarabov.ru&amp;gt; 1563188141 +0300
committer Ivan Bessarabov &amp;lt;ivan@bessarabov.ru&amp;gt; 1563188141 +0300

Initial commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here you can see commit message (&quot;Initial commit&quot;), info about ID that stores file structure (&quot;tree 496d...&quot;), name and email of commit author and the most interesting thing — the timestamp (1563188141) and timezone information (+0300) (every git commit has &quot;author&quot; and &quot;commiter&quot;, usually they are the same).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The timestamp is the number of seconds since 1st January 1970. If we convert 1563188141 to more human date we'll get &quot;2019-07-15 10:55:41&quot; — that is the time in UTC timezone. Then we add &quot;03&quot; hours and &quot;00&quot; minutes to that time and get &quot;2019-07-15 13:55:41&quot; — that is the time the commit author can see on his wall clock when he did commit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some serious code that is stored in VCS has lots and lots of commits and a lot of commit authors. So we can write a simple program that will check all the commits to filter only the commits by one person get the local time of that commit and aggregate it by hour when the commit was make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linus is the author of the Linux operating system, the author of the git VCS and the author of the less known program Subsurface (scuba diver tracking system).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is the graph with his commits hours to the repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux&quot;&gt;https://github.com/torvalds/linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linus makes an impression of totally normal person. Most of the commits are made at 10. There are practically no commits at night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to check when does some other programmer work (or if you want to find such information about yourself) here is a script that I used to get that info. This is a one-liner that you need to execute in the working copy of the repository. You need to specify --author option to git command. In most simple case you specify the name ('--author=&quot;Sebastian Riedel&quot;'). But is is also possible to use email ('--author=&quot;torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org&quot;') and specify more than one '--author'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bessarabov/674ea13c77fc8128f24b5e3f53b7f094&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/bessarabov/674ea13c77fc8128f24b5e3f53b7f094&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Errata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some previous versions of this this text has different numbers for Linus Torvalds' repos linux and git. I've used '--author=&quot;torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org&quot; --author=&quot;torvalds@linux-foundation.org&quot;' to get all the Linus commits. But there are some commits made by Linus &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bessarabov/34b240951c5b7813e0d20542b5f00e45&quot;&gt;with other emails&lt;/a&gt;. The current version of text uses data for commits filterd with '--author=&quot;Linus Torvalds&quot;'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in case of linux repo there was a bug. I've used 2 steps to generate graph: first save commit info to the file 'git log --author=&quot;torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org&quot; --author=&quot;torvalds@linux-foundation.org&quot; --date=iso &amp;gt; commits', and then feed that file to one-liner: 'cat all | | perl -nalE 'if (/^Date:\s+[\d-]{10}\s(\d{2})/) { say $1+0 }' | ...'. The first step does not finished correctly and the 'all' file had only partial data (the earlies commit saved in that file was f39e8409955fad210a9a7169cc53c4c18daaef3a )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are the previous versions of graphs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a continuation of this post:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>HTTP Security Headers – A Complete Guide</title>
<link>https://nullsweep.com/http-security-headers-a-complete-guide/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nullsweep.com/http-security-headers-a-complete-guide/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Companies selling &quot;security scorecards&quot; are on the rise, and have started to become a factor in enterprise sales. I have heard from customers who were concerned about purchasing from suppliers who had been given poor ratings, and in at least one case changed a purchasing decision based initially on the rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I investigated how these ratings companies calculate company security scores, and it turns out they use a combination of HTTP security header usage and IP reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP reputation is based on blacklists and spam lists combined with public IP ownership data. These should generally be clean as long as your company doesn't spam and can quickly detect and stop malware infections. HTTP security header usage is calculated similar to how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://observatory.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Observatory&lt;/a&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, for most companies, their score is largely determined by the security headers being set on public facing websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the right headers can be done quickly (usually without significant testing), can improve website security, and can now help you win deals with security conscious customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am dubious about the value of this test methodology and exorbitant pricing schemes these companies ask. I don't believe it correlates to real product security all that well. However it certainly increases the importance of spending time setting headers and getting them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will walk through the commonly evaluated headers, recommend security values for each, and give a sample header setting. At the end of the article, I will include sample setups for common applications and web servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-security-policy&quot;&gt;Content-Security-Policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CSP is used to prevent cross site scripting by specifying which resources are allowed to load. Of all the items in this list, this is perhaps the most time consuming to create and maintain properly and the most prone to risks. During development of your CSP, be careful to test it thoroughly – blocking a content source that your site uses in a valid way will break site functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great tool for creating a first draft is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/laboratory-by-mozilla/&quot;&gt;Mozilla laboratory CSP browser extension&lt;/a&gt;. Install this in your browser, thoroughly browse the site you want to create a CSP for, and then use the generated CSP on your site.  Ideally, also work to refactor the JavaScript so no inline scripts remain, so you can remove the 'unsafe inline' directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSP's can be complex and confusing, so if you want a deeper dive, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://content-security-policy.com/&quot;&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good starting CSP might be the following (this likely requires a lot of modifications on a real site). Add domains in each section that your site includes somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;# Default to only allow content from the current site
# Allow images from current site and imgur.com
# Don't allow objects such as Flash and Java
# Only allow scripts from the current site
# Only allow styles from the current site
# Only allow frames from the current site
# Restrict URL's in the &amp;lt;base&amp;gt; tag to current site
# Allow forms to submit only to the current site
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strict-transport-security&quot;&gt;Strict-Transport-Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This header tells the browser that the site should only be accessed via HTTPS – always enable when your site has HTTPS enabled. If you use subdomains, I also recommend enforcing this on any used sub domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=3600; includeSubDomains
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;x-content-type-options&quot;&gt;X-Content-Type-Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This header ensures that the MIME types set by the application are respected by browsers. This can help prevent certain types of cross site scripting bypasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also reduces unexpected application behavior where a browser may “guess” some kind of content incorrectly, such as when a developer labels a page “HTML” but the browser thinks it looks like JavaScript and tries to render it as JavaScript. This header will ensure the browser always respects the MIME type set by the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cache-control&quot;&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit trickier than the others because you likely want different caching policies for different content types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any page with sensitive data, such as a user page or a customer checkout page, should be set to no-cache. One reason for this is preventing someone on a shared computer from pressing the back button or going through history and being able to view personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, pages that change rarely, such as static assets (images, CSS files, and JS files), are good to cache. This could be done on a page by page basis, or using regex on the server configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;# Don’t cache by default
Header set Cache-Control no-cache

# Cache static assets for 1 day
&amp;lt;filesMatch &quot;.(css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|js|ico)$&quot;&amp;gt;
    Header set Cache-Control &quot;max-age=86400, public&quot;
&amp;lt;/filesMatch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;expires&quot;&gt;Expires&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets the time the cache should expire the current request. It is ignored if the Cache-Control max-age header is set, so we only set it in case a naive scanner is testing for it without considering cache-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For security purposes, we will assume that the browser should not cache anything, so we’ll set this to a date that always evaluates to the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;Expires: 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;x-frame-options&quot;&gt;X-Frame-Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This header indicates whether the site should be allowed to be displayed within an iFrame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a malicious site puts your website within an iFrame, the malicious site is able to perform a click jacking attack by running some JavaScript that will capture mouse clicks on the iFrame and then interact with the site on the users behalf (not necessarily clicking where they think they clicked!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should always be set to deny unless you are specifically using frames, in which case it should be set to same-origin. If you are using Frames with another site by design, you can white list the other domain here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that this header is superseded by the CSP frame-ancestors directive. I still recommend setting this for now to appease tools, but in the future it will likely be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;X-Frame-Options: deny
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;access-control-allow-origin&quot;&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell the browser which other sites' front end JavaScript code may make requests of the page in question. Unless you need to set this, the default is usually the right setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if SiteA serves up some JavaScript which wants to make a request to siteB, then siteB must serve the response with the header specifying that SiteA is allowed to make this request. If you need to set multiple origins, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;&gt;details page on MDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a little confusing, so I drew up a diagram to illustrate how this header functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://nullsweep.com/content/images/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-17-at-4.38.37-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Data flow with Access-Control-Allow-Origin
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.one.site.com
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-cookie&quot;&gt;Set-Cookie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that your cookies are sent via HTTPS (encrypted) only, and that they are not accessible via JavaScript. You can only send HTTPS cookies if your site also supports HTTPS, which it should. You should always set the following flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HttpOnly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sample Cookie definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;Set-Cookie: &amp;lt;cookie-name&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;cookie-value&amp;gt;; Domain=&amp;lt;domain-value&amp;gt;; Secure; HttpOnly
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie&quot;&gt;Mozilla documentation&lt;/a&gt; on cookies for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;x-xss-protection&quot;&gt;X-XSS-Protection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This header instructs browsers to halt execution of detected cross site scripting attacks. It is generally low risk to set, but should still be tested before putting in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-server-example-configurations&quot;&gt;Web Server Example Configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it's best to add headers site-wide in your server configuration. Cookies are the exception here, as they are often defined in the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before adding any headers to your site, I recommend first checking the observatory or manually looking at headers to see which are set already. Some frameworks and servers will automatically set some of these for you, so only implement the ones you need or want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;apache-configuration&quot;&gt;Apache Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample Apache setting in .htaccess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&amp;gt;
    ## CSP
    Header set Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';

        Header set Cache-Control &quot;max-age=86400, public&quot;
    &amp;lt;/filesMatch&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nginx-configuration&quot;&gt;Nginx Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;## CSP
add_header Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';

## General Security Headers
add_header X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.one.site.com;
add_header X-Frame-Options: deny;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=3600; includeSubDomains;

## Caching rules
# Don’t cache by default
add_header Cache-Control no-cache;
add_header Expires: 0;

# Cache static assets for 1 day
location ~* \.(?:ico|css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|svg|woff|ttf|eot)$ {
    try_files $uri @rewriteapp;
    add_header Cache-Control &quot;max-age=86400, public&quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have access to the web server, or have complex header setting needs, you may want to set these in the application itself. This can usually be done with framework middleware for an entire site, and on a per-response basis for one-off header setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only included one header for brevity in the examples. Add all that are needed via this method in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-and-express-&quot;&gt;Node and express:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a global mount path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-JavaScript&quot;&gt;app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    res.header('X-XSS-Protection', 1; mode=block);    
    next();
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;java-and-spring-&quot;&gt;Java and Spring:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of experience with Spring, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baeldung.com/spring-response-header&quot;&gt;Baeldung&lt;/a&gt; has a great guide to header setting in Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;php-&quot;&gt;PHP:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with the various PHP frameworks. Look for middleware that can handle requests. For a single response, it is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;header(&quot;X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;python-django&quot;&gt;Python / Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django includes configurable &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/middleware/&quot;&gt;security middleware&lt;/a&gt; that can handle all these settings for you. Enable those first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For specific pages, you can treat the response like a dictionary. Django has a special way to handle caching that should be investigated if trying to set cache headers this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;response = HttpResponse()
response[&quot;X-XSS-Protection&quot;] = &quot;1; mode=block&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting headers is relatively quick and easy. You will have a fairly significant increase in your site security for data protection, cross site scripting, and click jacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also ensure you don't lose future business deals as a result of company security ratings that rely on this information. This practice seems to be increasing, and I expect it to continue to play a role in enterprise sales in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many great things about being a human, but one of the most underappreciated is our need to bond with other humans. The urge to be sociable was hardwired into us long ago, say the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427593/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evolutionary psychologists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and it’s led to many of our favorite pastimes:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/421480/the-evolutionary-origin-of-laughter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;laughing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at things,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1037/1089-2680.8.2.100&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;gossip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the ability to have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/breasts_b_1910401&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;face-to-face sex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But it also has a nasty side effect: When the bonding instinct is left hanging — when we’re not getting our regular fix of friendly kudos as a valued fellow member of the species — we run the risk of feeling lonely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until recently, loneliness has also been largely underappreciated. It’s an emotional state we’ve all dwelt in at some point of our lives, and it’s so familiar that it’s tempting to overlook it as mundane amid all the other mental health worries currently being given airtime, such as depression and anxiety. Nevertheless, the world is starting to wake up to the serious damage too much alone-time can do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have shown that when they get too deeply entrenched and gnaw on our psyche for too long, feelings of loneliness are high&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahsw.org.uk/userfiles/Research/Perspectives%20on%20Psychological%20Science-2015-Holt-Lunstad-227-37.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for early death that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;among things like high blood pressure, obesity, alcoholism and smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Similarly, loneliness has been closely linked to a range of conditions, including heart disease, strokes and Alzheimer’s (a grim reality we’ve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/if-youre-crushingly-lonely-youre-not-alone&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;looked at before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, along with why, in younger age categories, these risks are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/men-hit-peak-loneliness-at-age-35&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;exacerbated for men&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it gets worse. As if this debilitating flaw in our emotional scaffolding wasn’t unwelcome enough, some of the humans most at risk have had to grow up in England. And take it from one of those, while there are many benefits to being an English-type human (the ingratiating Harry Potter accent, the pastry-based diet, the no-questions-asked, free-to-access healthcare for all), in the specific context of loneliness, it has its own unfortunate downside: Our inability to cope with almost all social situations, which tends to turn everything from accidentally making eye-contact on a bus to asking for no tomatoes in your salad an epic psychodrama of self-doubt and agonizing micro-regrets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This customary handwringing is normally interpreted as English ‘reserve’ or ‘coldness,’ but it’s far better explained by the social anthropologist Kate Fox in her 2004 book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Watching-English-Hidden-Rules-Behavior/dp/185788616X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=watching+the+english&amp;amp;qid=1563216982&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watching the English&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which spends much of its 400-plus finely crafted pages honing in on “one particular defining characteristic of Englishness — the one I have taken to calling our ‘social dis-ease,’ our inhibited insularity, our chronic social awkwardness, bordering on a sort of sub-clinical combination of autism and agoraphobia.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see the problem here: A national culture that promotes polite restraint, and which actively fends off and forestalls the forming of relationships between strangers, is one that might as well be inviting loneliness on its population. And at a time when emotional seclusion is increasingly being seen as a crisis in countries around the Western world, perhaps this is what has made English people uniquely sensitive to loneliness as a major health concern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, Look at All the Lonely People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, loneliness is being recognized by national decision-makers in other parts of the world, too: Some 70 local municipalities, schools and businesses across Denmark have signed up to the country’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://modensomhed.dk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Movement Against Loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an organization that’s been getting isolated Danes together for communal meals since 2016; and in May,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;New Zealand’s progressive Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;unveiled a bold “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/new-zealand-is-publishing-its-first-well-being-budget/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;well-being budget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” for her country, which places Kiwis’ mental health among its top five spending priorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it was the British Prime Minister Theresa May who appointed the world’s first Minister for Loneliness in January 2018, making the fight against isolation officially the business of the central government, to “address the sad reality of modern life.” And it’s the U.K. that’s tasked its public health-care system with a major initiative to tackle the problem. When the new ministerial post was announced — which no one in government thought to call “The Lone Ranger,” which is a great, great shame — it made&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/europe/uk-britain-loneliness.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;headlines across the globe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, striking a chord with those already grappling with the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The U.K. very much leads the way,” says Michelle H. Lim, who is scientific chair of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endloneliness.com.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Australian Coalition to End Loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a group of universities and non-profit organizations that have joined forces to coordinate research and to influence public policy in Australia. In Britain, she says, the government, charities and institutions that focus on loneliness have already begun to turn debate into serious, concerted action: “They have significant investments in this space, and ‘loneliness’ is a term that’s a little bit more socialized at the moment with the U.K. public. Whereas in Australia, because we haven’t had this level of investment, when we say the word ‘loneliness,’ people go, ‘Oh, that’s not me!’ — even though they might be feeling lonely. They under-report, they don’t identify or they misunderstand.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Lim, a big source of that misunderstanding is people’s tendency to confuse subjective feelings of loneliness with the physical state of social isolation. “You might meet people and be embedded within families, be married, but you might still feel a sense of disconnection from other people,” says Lim, who sees loneliness as more to do with the quality of the relationships people hold than the quantity of people they’re encountering day to day. Not only that, she says, but statistically the two are “only modestly correlated. You can have social isolation but not feel lonely, or you can feel lonely and not be socially isolated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of which might partially account for the staggering statistics around self-reported loneliness that have been surfacing in recent years. The U.K. government’s intervention was prompted by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42354807&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a report published in 2017 by the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;— a body that was originally set up by the Member of Parliament who was tragically murdered by a far-right terrorist in the run-up to 2016’s Brexit vote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the course of its research, the commission found that more than 9 million people, which is around 14 percent of the U.K. population, said they felt lonely either “often” or “always.” In the U.S., meanwhile, a 2018&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/docs/IndexReport_1524069371598-173525450.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of more than 20,000 Americans found that 46 percent reported “sometimes or always feeling alone,” and that “Generation Z (adults ages 18 to 22) and millennials (adults ages 23 to 37) are lonelier and claim to be in worse health than older generations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s been little so far in the formulation of a coordinated policy at the federal level in the U.S.,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Murthy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;has long been vocal about the challenge this poses to public health in the U.S., asserting in an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “During my years caring for patients, the most common pathology I saw was not heart disease or diabetes. It was loneliness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does It Worry You to Be Alone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although the current focus on isolation is often described in the media as “the loneliness epidemic,” Robin Hewings, Director of Campaigns, Policy and Research for the U.K.’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campaign to End Loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, warns that for a subjective, self-reported experience like loneliness, “it’s not very easy to make comparisons across time, and it’s not obvious that it’s getting worse.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While he acknowledges that aging populations mean that there are likely to be a greater number of elderly people around who are suffering from isolation than in previous decades, he also points out that when you look at the percentages of those affected, the trends are harder to discern. “There was some work done in the late 1940s, which would seem to suggest a not dissimilar level to today. This is right at the speculative end,” he cautions, “but imagine the world in the late 1940s: On the one hand, you can picture greater levels of neighborliness. But if someone were to move for work, or your son emigrated to Australia, you would never see them again. We have worries that some of the recent developments on the internet and in social media might have pushed us apart,” but modern means of communication, he says, “can help bring people together,” too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People also use technology to maintain friendships,” agrees Lim, who likewise points out that it’s difficult to get a reliable measure on whether societies’ loneliness problems, in their nature or in their magnitude, have actually changed in recent decades. “Loneliness is an age-old condition; it’s not something that’s new.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turns out there’s also not much evidence to support a popular theory that the increasing secularization of Western societies — where religion is seen as a traditional route for people to regularly come together — is a major factor driving modern loneliness. Counterintuitively, says Hewings, “It would seem on a number of different surveys that levels of loneliness are lower in Northern and Western Europe than they are in Southern and Eastern Europe, which are generally a bit more religious.” Turning up at your local synagogue, church, mosque or temple of choice might well help by offering a ready-made network of social connections, if worship is where you find meaning — as highlighted in a recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faithaction.net/working-with-you/tackling-loneliness/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;from the U.K.’s Parliamentary Group on Faith and Society — but at the level of society, religion itself, it seems, is no panacea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What has changed in the past few years, says Lim, is that research has uncovered the true implications of both loneliness and social isolation, “and we’re much more aware of the negative consequences of loneliness on health, and on social [aspects] like our communities.” As new knowledge about how devastating it’s been emerges, she says, “people have started to try to understand the impact of subjective indicators,” of being disconnected, and not just the physical signs like a lack of social involvement. “Previously you might see a lot of focus on just getting people out of the house, or just getting people more friends,” says Lim, “whereas now we know what’s needed is not just that, but also a focus on: How do you make sure that when people do have these networks, the networks are actually meaningful to them?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No More Lonely Nights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time it was created, some critics saw the U.K.’s Minister of Loneliness job as political virtue-signaling, jumping on the bandwagon of society’s increasing concern for mental well-being. Nine months later, though, it produced something that’s broadly been welcomed by social-welfare campaigners as a sizeable step forward: An 84-page “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-connected-society-a-strategy-for-tackling-loneliness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strategy for Tackling Loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” which came with a pledge to pursue the scientific evidence for the causes and impacts of loneliness, a timeline for delivering commitments across a number of government departments, from education to housing, and crucially, around $28 million in initial funding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 60 or so action points contained in the report, says Hewings, “To pick out the one that’s the most important and the most immediately tangible — the one where you could actually see an impact on people’s lives happening quite soon — is that the government is going to roll out social prescribing across England.” Remember that uncomplicated free-to-access healthcare that was one of the upsides to living in the U.K.? The idea behind “social prescribing” is to make severe loneliness part of the National Health Service’s frontline duty of care for anyone who needs it — which, given the scale of the problem, is a fairly astounding thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the government seems serious about funding it, and has proposed it would work like this: You might visit your doctor with a physical complaint, but if feelings of isolation are suspected as an underlying cause of your maladies, rather than just offer you medication, they will instead refer you to a “link worker,” whose job it is to treat you for loneliness. The link worker would, as outlined by the government strategy, “work with people to produce a tailored plan to meet the person’s well-being needs. They help people to overcome feelings of loneliness by connecting them to activities and support within their local area. This can include a range of activities from arts participation, befriending and sport or exercise, as well as debt, housing or employment advice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s basically freely prescribed therapy-lite, and according to Hewings, it’s envisioned as “quite an in-depth piece of work.” And he confirms, “the experience of people who have been providing those kinds of services already has been positive” for those receiving care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it’s not a completely altruistic move on the authorities’ part. Hewings points out that, despite the hefty upfront cost of providing this case-by-case counseling, the program has also been designed as a pressure valve for Britain’s beleaguered National Health Service, which has been buckling under the combined strain of a decade of austerity cuts and a steadily aging population. In the long term, he says, reducing loneliness is expected to actually save the Health Service money, partly by preventing many life-threatening illnesses across U.K. society, “but it also helps the Health Service get the most value for money by focusing doctors on their areas of expertise, while people who have more social needs can be better connected to the things that they need.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another big part of the strategy is a public information campaign, which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLuYesILJpM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;launched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in June and is aimed at reducing the stigma attached to the idea of loneliness, as well as to help people see it as an issue that doesn’t just affect the elderly. “Loneliness is particularly associated with transitions,” says Hewings, and “in younger people, there’s a whole set of transitions: Changing jobs, friendship groups changing, etc.” In fact, “the riskiest time, certainly for some episode of loneliness, is that early 18-to-24 phase — the transitions people are going through make it a challenging time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLuYesILJpM?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hewings points to the personal experiences of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Cox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jo Cox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the M.P. responsible for the U.K. government’s original exploration of the issue: “She was one of the early pioneers in this area, and what made her focused on it was her experiences at university feeling lonely. It grew out of her personal experience, and then, before she was murdered, she set up the Loneliness Commission, which was then taken forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lonely Hearts Club: Banned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Young or old, though, for anyone who’s feeling isolated, “By talking about it, you’re de-stigmatizing it,” says Lim. “It’s the way we were with depression, for example, 20 years ago.” For those like Lim, who are trying to address the problem through hard data and evidence-based research, the difficulty people have in admitting they feel lonely, both to themselves and to others, poses “probably one of the biggest barriers. People who are rolling out community programs or solutions never use the word loneliness, because you want to promote the program, or improve engagement with programs.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lim hopes that a public debate that demystifies and normalizes loneliness, so people will openly acknowledge it as one aspect of mental well-being among all the others we’re discussing right now, will “give people permission to connect with someone on that day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiding our loneliness from each other seems a deeply ingrained instinct, though. It’s another quirk of human nature that was in the foreground of Kate Fox’s anthropological investigations of 15 years ago. She was talking about the social habits of the English specifically, but she could have been talking about millions of people in other cultures all over the world when she observed, “We have a desperate need for social contact and emotional bonding, but we cannot simply acknowledge this need, and get on with the pursuit of human warmth and intimacy in a natural, straightforward fashion.” Instead, she went on, we have to “disguise our craving for social contact as a burning desire to throw balls at each other, or to perfect our flower-arranging or motorcycle-maintenance skills, or to save the whales, or the world, or something — and then go to the pub, where we can pretend that we are only there for the beer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wherever you come from, and whatever cultural norms govern your interactions with others, I’m betting you can relate to this on some level. If not, you’ll at least have a sense of what it’s like to feel cut off from human contact, and appreciate why, for those living with that experience 24/7, it’s such an important thing to confront, at every level: individuals, friends and families, communities, populations. Lim is optimistic that as long as we’re talking about it, precisely because we’re socially motivated creatures, it’s a thing that can ultimately be dealt with: “Humans are designed to be kind to each other, and we’re designed to rely on each other and to thrive.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you can’t relate to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;— well, you’re pretty much on your own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;img aspect-set&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2019/07/17/c310d1e6-2aab-4191-a52d-d3d18eb33e0f/9b756ad2e73a3ec45b68cb964ae9f3d3/rust.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Rust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;relatedContent alignRight&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;int&quot;&gt;techrepublic cheat sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to explore using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Rust programming language&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to C, C++, and others, as a way to improve the security posture of its and everyone else's apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made yesterday by Gavin Thomas, Principal Security Engineering Manager for the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're probably used to thinking about the Microsoft Security Response Center as a group that responds to incidents and vulnerabilities,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thomas said&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We are a response organization, but we also have a proactive role, and in a new blog series we will highlight Microsoft's exploration of safer system programming languages, starting with Rust.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end game is to find a way to move developers from the aging C and C++ programming language to so-called &quot;memory-safe languages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory-safe languages, such as Rust, are designed from the ground up with protections against memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, memory leaks, use-after free and memory pointer-related bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C#, a programming language developed by Microsoft, also features some memory access improvements but is not as advanced as Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;70% of all Microsoft patches are for memory-related bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/MSRC-Security-Research/blob/master/presentations/2019_02_BlueHatIL/2019_01%20-%20BlueHatIL%20-%20Trends%2C%20challenge%2C%20and%20shifts%20in%20software%20vulnerability%20mitigation.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;In research presented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at the BlueHat Israel security conference, Microsoft security engineer Matt Miller said that over the last 12 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around 70% of all Microsoft's yearly patches were fixes for memory safety bugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;img aspect-set&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-explore-using-rust/&quot; class=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft memory safety trends&quot; data-original=&quot; https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2019/02/11/0aafd5ae-20fa-48a3-bbe6-a2251a53e664/a447043a76b0d0cbd11a2f6d9c15df63/microsoft-memory-safety-trends.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img aspect-set&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2019/02/11/0aafd5ae-20fa-48a3-bbe6-a2251a53e664/a447043a76b0d0cbd11a2f6d9c15df63/microsoft-memory-safety-trends.png&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft memory safety trends&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Image: Matt Miller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this high percentage is because Windows and most other Microsoft products have been written mostly in C and C++, two &quot;memory-unsafe&quot; programming languages that allow developers fine-grained control of the memory addresses and where code can be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One slip-up in the developers' code that manages memory execution can lead to a slew of memory safety errors that attackers can exploit with dangerous and intrusive consequences -- such as remote code execution or elevation of privilege flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the use of a memory-safe language such as Rust would provide an alternative to creating safer Microsoft apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas also argues that third-party developers should also be looking into memory-safe languages as well. He cites reasons such as the time and effort developers put into learning how to debug the memory-related security flaws that crop up in their C++ apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A developer's core job is not to worry about security but to do feature work,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Rather than investing in more and more tools and training and vulnerability fixes, what about a development language where they can't introduce memory safety issues into their feature work in the first place? That would help both the feature developers and the security engineers-and the customers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft explored memory-safe programming before&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft looking into Rust, as a safer alternative to C++ isn't actually such a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OS maker has been looking for safer C and C++ alternatives for years. In June 2016, Microsoft open-sourced &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/checked-c/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Checked C&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; an extension to the C programming language that brought new features to address a series of security-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft looking into Rust before any other memory-safe language is also not a bad decision. Besides being superior to C# in regards to better memory protections, Rust is also more popular with developers these days and might be easier to recruit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rust -- a hit with the developer community already&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-developers-reveal-most-loved-most-loathed-what-pays-best/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;today's &quot;most loved&quot; programming language&lt;/a&gt;, according to the 2019 StackOverflow survey, the biggest developer survey on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers love it because of its simpler syntax and the fact that apps coded in Rust don't yield the same amount of bugs, allowing developers to focus on expanding their apps, instead of doing constant maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, StackOverflow survey respondents ranked C as the fourth most hated programming language, with C++ ranking ninth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust, which started as a research project at Mozilla for developing a safer and faster programming language to rewrite the Firefox browser, is also gaining in popularity after organizations started deploying it in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While initially, most developers dismissed it as a theoretical project, nowadays Rust is proving its mettle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-begins-process-of-letting-firefox-rust/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It's been deployed in Firefox since July 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the Brave browser also replaced its ad-blocking component -- originally coded in C++ -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/brave-defies-googles-moves-to-cripple-ad-blocking-with-new-69x-faster-rust-engine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;with a Rust version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; are also two other major tech players who are now running Rust in production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FaceApp Now Owns Access to More Than 150M People&amp;#039;s Faces and Names</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/07/17/viral-app-faceapp-now-owns-access-to-more-than-150-million-peoples-faces-and-names/#25ca052b62f1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/07/17/viral-app-faceapp-now-owns-access-to-more-than-150-million-peoples-faces-and-names/#25ca052b62f1</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;Everyone's seen them: friends posting pictures of themselves now, and years in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral app FaceApp has been giving people the power to change their facial expressions, looks, and now age for several years. But at the same time, people have been giving FaceApp the power to use their pictures — and names — for any purpose it wishes, for as long as it desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/539983598/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Diversity and difference&quot; data-height=&quot;4994&quot; data-width=&quot;5000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Composite image of a diverse group of people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Getty&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we thought we learned a lesson from Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people have downloaded the app from &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;. And FaceApp is now the top-ranked app on the iOS App Store in 121 countries, according to App Annie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/07/18/controversy-good-for-business-faceapp-downloads-jumped-561/#22eeef16577c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;NEW: Apptopia now earning $90,000/day&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While according to FaceApp's &lt;a href=&quot;https://faceapp.com/terms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; people still own their own &quot;user content&quot; (read: face), the company owns a never-ending and irrevocable royalty-free license to do anything they want with it ... in front of whoever they wish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote-embed embed-1 bg-accent color-base font-accent&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed, without compensation to you. When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Services, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your [username], location or profile photo) will be visible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;FaceApp terms of use&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may not be dangerous and your likeness may stay on Amazon servers in America, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/07/17/faceapp-is-the-russian-face-aging-app-a-danger-to-your-privacy/#4781e35e2755&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Forbes has determined&lt;/a&gt;, but they still own a license to do whatever they want with it. That doesn't mean the app's Russian parent company, Wireless Labs, will offer your face to the FSB, but it does have consequences, as PhoneArena's Peter Kostadinov &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phonearena.com/news/FaceApp-gender-age-filter-app-privacy-concerns-issue-Russia-elections_id117529&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote-embed embed-2 bg-accent color-base font-accent&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might end up on a billboard somewhere in Moscow, but your face will most likely end up training some AI facial-recognition algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Peter Kostadinov &lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that matters to you or not is your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what we have learned in the past few years about viral Facebook apps is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/03/22/1-5b-accounts-facebooks-epic-free-data-giveaway-could-be-the-largest-privacy-breach-ever/#44c429c7bc40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;the data they collect&lt;/a&gt; is not always used for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2017/11/09/trumps-election-data-firm-has-100-track-record-in-winning-elections/#119414bc5c91&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;purposes that we might assume&lt;/a&gt;. And, that the data collected is not always stored securely, safely, privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once something is uploaded to the cloud, you've lost control whether or not you've given away legal license to your content. That's one reason why privacy-sensitive Apple is doing most of its AI work &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/apple-debuts-core-ml-3-with-on-device-machine-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;on-device&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's a good reason to be wary when any app wants access and a license to your digital content and/or identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As former Rackspace manager Rob La Gesse mentioned today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote-embed embed-3 bg-accent color-base font-accent&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make FaceApp actually work, you have to give it permissions to access your photos - ALL of them. But it also gains access to Siri and Search .... Oh, and it has access to refreshing in the background - so even when you are not using it, it is using you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Rob La Gesse&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app doesn't have to be doing anything nefarious today to make you cautious about giving it that much access to your most personal computing device.&lt;/p&gt;

The website of Kyoto Animation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;KYOTO -- An arson attack at a Kyoto Animation studio on the morning of July 18 has left 33 people dead, police and firefighters said, making it the worst such attack in Japan in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;A man allegedly entered the No. 1 studio of the Kyoto Animation building in Fushimi Ward in the western Japan city of Kyoto at around 10:30 a.m., poured what appeared to be gasoline around while screaming, &quot;Go die,&quot; and set fire to it. The man was injured and admitted to a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;A plastic container and a knife were found left at the scene. The 41-year-old suspect told prefectural police that he set fire to the three-story building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;At least 36 people were injured, 10 of them seriously. Police said the man who started the fire tried to leave the scene, but a worker followed him. Police officers who arrived at the site found him sitting down several dozen meters away from the building and apprehended him after questioning him. He was believed to have second-degree burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;About 30 fire engines were mobilized to extinguish the fire. About 70 people including employees were in the No. 1 studio at the time of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;The No. 1 studio, with a total floor space of about 700 square meters, was burned down in the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Firefighters quoted a local resident as reporting that there had been an explosion on the first floor of the building. Another person who called police said there was smoke rising from the building, and a person could be heard crying for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;According to the National Police Agency, the arson attack is the worst in Japan in terms of the number of victims since the beginning of the previous Heisei era in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Think in Math, Write in Code</title>
<link>https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=704&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Think in Math. Write in Code.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;287.92700677845&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Think in Math. Write in Code.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/8/19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers love to discuss programming languages. Besides debating their own merits, we integrate them into our identities and even infer things about others who use them. Some even defend a form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_determinism&quot;&gt;Linguistic Determinism&lt;/a&gt; that thinking is limited to what is typable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we spend so much time using languages, an interest in making them better is justified. However, the character of these debates suggests that we think of them as something more. Perhaps we have forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are &lt;em&gt;implementation tools&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;thinking tools&lt;/em&gt;. They are strict formal languages invented to instruct machines in a human-friendly way. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thinking in Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural language which has been effectively used for thinking about computation, for thousands of years, is mathematics. Most people don’t think of math as free or flexible. Their experience of seeing scary symbols and memorizing steps in school is quite the opposite. I hope readers of this article have had a better experience with math, such as in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486678709&quot;&gt;discrete math&lt;/a&gt; or linear algebra course; the kind that involves constructing clear definitions and deductions, and is written in prose with a mix of symbols (most symbols weren’t even invented until the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematical_notation#Symbolic_stage&quot;&gt;16th century&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math allows you to reason about logical structures, free from other constraints. This is also what programming requires: creating logical systems to solve problems. Take a look at the basic pattern for programming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design algorithms and data structures to solve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement and test them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, work is not so well organized as there is interplay between steps. You may write code to inform the design. Even so, the basic pattern is followed over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that steps 1 and 2 are the ones that take most of our time, ability, and effort. At the same time, these steps don’t lend themselves to programming languages. That doesn’t stop programmers from attempting to solve them in their editor, but they end up with code that is muddled, slow, or that solves the wrong problem. It’s not that programming languages aren’t good enough yet. It’s that &lt;em&gt;no formal language&lt;/em&gt; could be good at it. Our brains just don’t think that way. When problems get hard, we draw diagrams and discuss them with collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, steps 1 and 2 are solved first, and only then will a programming language be used to solve step 3. This has an added benefit of transforming the implementation process. With a mathematical solution in hand, you can then focus on choosing the best representation and implementation, and writing better code, knowing what the end goal will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are programming languages burdensome thinking tools? One reason is that writing code is inseparably connected with implementation. Implementation concerns are necessary for instructing computers and are worth doing well, but they also distract from the problem to be solved. Think about all the considerations for writing a simple function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What inputs should I provide?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should they be named?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types should they be? (Even dynamically typed languages must consider types, it’s just implicit.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I pass them by value or by reference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What file should I put the function in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should the result be reused, or is it fast enough to recalculate it every time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list can go on. The point is that these considerations have nothing to do with what the function does. They distract from the problem the function is trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many languages aim to hide details such as these, which is helpful, especially for mundane tasks. However, they cannot transcend their role as an implementation tool. SQL is easily one of the most successful examples of this, but it is ultimately concerned with implementation concerns such as tables, rows, indices, and types. Because of this, programmers still design complicated queries in informal terms, like what they want to “get,” before writing a bunch of &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflexible Abstractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation of programming languages is that they are poor abstraction tools. Typically, when we discuss abstraction in engineering, we mean hiding implementation details. A complex operation or process is packaged into a “black box” with its contents hidden and well-defined inputs and outputs exposed. Accompanying the box is a fictional story about what it does, that is easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/black-box.gif&quot; alt=&quot;black box picture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black boxes are essential for engineering large systems since the details are too overwhelming to hold in your head. They also have many well-known limitations. A black box &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/&quot;&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; because its brief description cannot completely determine its behavior. The opaque interfaces introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHLpKzUxjGk&quot;&gt;inefficiencies&lt;/a&gt;, like duplication and fragmented design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly for problem-solving, black boxes are rigid. They present a fixed level of abstraction which may be too high-level or too low-level for the problem. In theory, you can always look inside the box, but in code, the abstraction level at any one time is fixed. They also offer only one perspective of abstraction. A high-level web server may provide a terrific interface for serving JSON, but be useless if one wants an interface for serving incomplete data streams, such as output from a program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the word abstraction in math is nothing like hiding information. Here, abstraction means extracting the essential features or characteristics of something, in relation to a particular context. Unlike black boxes, no information is hidden. They don’t leak in the same way. You are encouraged to adjust to the right level of abstraction and quickly jump between perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this problem best represented as a table? Or, a function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I look at the whole system as a function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I treat this collection of things as a single unit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I look at the whole system or a single part?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What assumptions should I make? Should I make them stronger or weaker?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just look at the many ways of looking at a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZDnF8-9Ks&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/functions.gif&quot; alt=&quot;function representations&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major branches of math represent commonly useful abstractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geometry abstracts fundamental shapes from objects in the world (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein#Erlangen_program&quot;&gt;transformation invariants&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how cosmic you want to get).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topology abstracts surface features from their shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group theory abstracts binary operations to properties about how they are composed and inverted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these fields aren’t the limit. You can pick the properties that are important to the problem and ignore everything else. The example project at the end shows how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming languages are great for building black boxes; they provide functions, classes, and modules, all of which help wrap up code into nice interfaces. However, when trying to solve problems and design solutions, what you actually want is the math kind of abstraction. If you try to think at the keyboard, the black boxes available to you will warp your view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem Representation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as programming languages are limited in their ability to abstract, they also are limited in how they represent data. The very act of implementing an algorithm or data structure is picking &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; of the many possible ways to represent it. Typically, this is not a decision you want to make until you understand what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, graphs (sets of vertices and edges) appear in many programming problems such as internet networks, pathfinding, and social networks. Despite their simple definition, choosing how to represent them is hard and depends on their use case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/graph.gif&quot; alt=&quot;math graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.3468335787923&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one which most closely matches the definition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;vertices: vector&amp;lt;NodeData&amp;gt; edges: vector&amp;lt;pair&amp;lt;Int, Int&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; The vertices can be removed if you only care about connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to traverse a node’s neighbors quickly, then you probably want a node structure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Node { id: Int, neighbors: vector&amp;lt;Node*&amp;gt; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix&quot;&gt;adjacency matrix&lt;/a&gt;. Where each row stores the neighbors of a particular node:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;connectivity: vector&amp;lt;vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathfinding algorithms often work on graphs implicitly from a board of cells:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;walls: vector&amp;lt;vector&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-to-peer network, each computer is a vertex and each socket is an edge. The entire graph isn’t even accessible from one machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math allows you to reason about the graph itself, solve the problem, and then choose an appropriate representation. If you think in a programming language, you cannot delay this decision as your first line of code commits to a particular representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the graph representations are too diverse to conform to a single interface, typeclass, or even program. So creating a completely reusable library is impractical. It can only work on a few types, or force all graphs into an inappropriate representation. That doesn’t mean libraries aren’t useful. Similar representations are needed again and again (like &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;), but you cannot write a library which solves a graph problem once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some modern programming languages attempt to provide more mathematical abstraction tools. For example, Haskell has &lt;code&gt;Ring&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; typeclasses. However, the representation issues show that these features must be less useful than their theoretical inspirations. It is smart to write an algorithm which relies only on the associative property and document it is as such. This is thinking in the language of math. But, in practice, it can only reasonably work on a small family of similar types. A simple generic with a few types in mind is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a corollary, programming languages should focus primarily on being useful implementation tools, rather than thinking tools. C got this right in a big way. Modern language features such as C#’s async and await provide great improvements for implementing concurrent programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does thinking in math look like? Recently, I worked on an API at work for pricing cryptocurrency for merchants. It takes into account recent price changes and recommends that merchants charge a higher price during volatile times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we did some homework on the theory, we wanted to empirically test it to see how it performed during various market conditions. To do so, I designed a bot to simulate a merchant doing business with our API, to see how it performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTC/USD (1 day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/btc-usd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;btc usd&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;exchange rate&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;r(t)&lt;/code&gt; is the market rate of &lt;code&gt;fiat/crypto&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;merchant rate&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;r'(t)&lt;/code&gt; is the modified exchange rate which the merchant is advised to charge customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; When a customer buys an item, we call that event a &lt;strong&gt;purchase&lt;/strong&gt;. A purchase consists of the price in fiat and a time. &lt;code&gt;p = (f, t)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of crypto for a purchase is found by applying the modified exchange rate &lt;code&gt;t(p) = p(1) / r'(p(2))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;p(1) / r'(p(2)) = fiat / (fiat/crypto) = fiat * crypto/fiat = crypto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; When the merchant sells their crypto holdings, we call that event a &lt;strong&gt;sale&lt;/strong&gt;. A sale consists of an amount in crypto and a timestamp. &lt;code&gt;s = (c, t)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of fiat the merchant obtained from a sale is found by applying the exchange rate to the sale &lt;code&gt;g(s) = s(1) * r(s(2))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;s(1) * r(s(2)) = crypto * (fiat/crypto) = fiat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;balance&lt;/strong&gt; of a set of purchases and sales is the difference between all purchase crypto amounts and all sale crypto amounts. &lt;code&gt;b(P, S) = sum from i to N of t(p_i) - sum from j to M of s_j(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;b(P, S) &amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; must always hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;earnings&lt;/strong&gt; of a set of purchases and sales is the difference between sale fiat amounts and purchase fiat amounts. &lt;code&gt;e(P, S) = sum from j to M of g(s_j(1)) - sum from i to N of p_i(1) &amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; We say that the merchant rate is &lt;strong&gt;favorable&lt;/strong&gt; iff the earnings are non-negative for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; sets of &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; purchases and sales. &lt;code&gt;r'(t) is favorable iff e(P, S) &amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a favorable case, the merchant didn’t lose any fiat by accepting crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; will not be rigorously defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt;, we can assume that merchants will sell their crypto in a timely manner. So assume &lt;code&gt;s_i(2) - s_j(2) &amp;lt; W&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;i,j in {1.. M}&lt;/code&gt; for some bound &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;. Purchase amounts should be randomly distributed within a reasonable range that commerce is done. Perhaps $10-100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of the bot is to verify that &lt;code&gt;r'(t)&lt;/code&gt; is favorable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this definition is only one measure of quality. Perhaps protecting against the worst case is more important than being favorable. In that case, we would be concerned about the ability to construct a set of purchases with very negative earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat many times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Randomly choose a time range &lt;code&gt;[t0, t1]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a set of &lt;strong&gt;purchases&lt;/strong&gt; at random times within &lt;code&gt;[t0, t1]&lt;/code&gt;. The price should fall within a range &lt;code&gt;[p0, p1&lt;/code&gt;] of &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a set of &lt;strong&gt;sales&lt;/strong&gt; at evenly spaced times (perhaps with slight random noise) within &lt;code&gt;[t0, t1]&lt;/code&gt;. Each sale should be for the full &lt;strong&gt;balance&lt;/strong&gt; at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the &lt;strong&gt;earnings&lt;/strong&gt; for these sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record the earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report how many earnings were negative and non-negative. Show a percentage for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the minimum and maximum earnings and report them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this example, I think your tendency may be to think that its statements are obvious. Certainly, none of these steps are hard. However, it was surprising to me how many of my assumptions were corrected and how difficult it was to choose an objective definition of a &lt;strong&gt;favorable&lt;/strong&gt; outcome. This process helped me become aware of assumptions I would not have even considered if I had started by simply writing code. Perhaps the greatest benefit was that after writing it, I was able to quickly review it with a co-worker and make corrections which were easy on paper, but would have been difficult to change in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that thinking in the language of math will bring similar benefits to your projects! Note that this example is only one style of utilizing mathematical thinking. I recommend reading others by &lt;a href=&quot;https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/pubs.html#eatcs&quot;&gt;Leslie Lamport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Creative-Udi-Manber/dp/0201120372&quot;&gt;Udi Manber&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stepanovpapers.com/PAM.pdf&quot;&gt;Alex Stepanov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ex-Microsoft dev used test account to swipe $10M in store credits</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/17/exmicrosoft_engineer_arrested_fraud/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/17/exmicrosoft_engineer_arrested_fraud/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft software engineer was arrested on Tuesday and charged with mail fraud for allegedly attempting to steal $10m in digital currency from his former employer, US prosecutors said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volodymyr Kvashuk, 25, a citizen of Ukraine residing in Renton, Washington, initially worked for Microsoft as a contractor and was hired as an employee in August 2016, where he remained employed until he was dismissed in June 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvashuk, according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/07/17/us_v_kvashuk.pdf&quot;&gt;the prosecution's complaint&lt;/a&gt; [PDF], filed in a US federal district court in Seattle, was a member of Microsoft's Universal Store Team (UST), tasked with handling the company's e-commerce operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UST &quot;is the main commercial engine of Microsoft with the mission to bring One Universal Store for all commerce at Microsoft,&quot; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/universal-store-journey-continuous-delivery-devops&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Sam Guckenheimer, product owner for Azure DevOps at Microsoft, back in 2017. &quot;The UST encompasses everything Microsoft sells and everything others sell through the company, consumer and commercial, digital and physical, subscription and transaction, via all channels and storefronts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the complaint, UST members set up dummy customer accounts with the Microsoft online store linked to specially created email addresses and test-in-production credit cards for making store purchases without generating an actual charge. Team members then whitelist their test accounts to bypass Microsoft's security and risk mitigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;'No safeguards'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in designing its testing system, Microsoft overlooked a significant attack vector. &quot;The testing program was designed to block the delivery of physical goods,&quot; the complaint explains. &quot;Microsoft did not anticipate testers would make test purchases of digital currency (&quot;Currency Stored Value&quot; or &quot;CSV&quot;) and thus no safeguards were put in place to prevent the delivery of CSV.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a tester could make test purchases of Microsoft digital gift cards, obtaining a valid product key that could be redeemed to add value to a digital wallet associated with the purchaser's account. The electronic funds credited could then be used to buy digital or physical Microsoft products from its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvashuk, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-microsoft-software-engineer-charged-mail-fraud-scheme-steal-digital-value-such&quot;&gt;it's alleged&lt;/a&gt;, bought some Microsoft goods himself and also sold much of the currency – $10m worth, it's claimed – to third-parties, at a discount to its face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/01/16/fraudd_3456787.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;cards&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Software nasty can burn through 1.7 million account numbers per hour&quot;&gt;GiftGhostBot scares up victims' gift-card cash with brute-force attacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme supposedly began in 2017 and escalated to the point that Kvashuk, on a base salary of $116,000 per year, bought himself a $162,000 Tesla and $1.6m home in Renton, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvashuk, the complaint suggests, was undone by Microsoft's UST Fraud Investigation Strike Team (FIST), which noticed a suspicious increase in the use of CSV to buy subscriptions to Microsoft's Xbox gaming system in February 2018. The investigators traced the digital funds, which had been resold on two different websites, to two whitelisted test accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, FIST proceeded to trace the accounts and transactions involved. With the assistance of the US Secret Service and the Internal Revenue Service, investigators concluded that Kvashuk had defrauded Microsoft, despite efforts to conceal his identity with fake accounts and to hide public blockchain transactions using a Bitcoin mixing service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to service provider records that point to Kvashuk, the complaint notes that Microsoft's online store uses a form of device fingerprinting called a Fuzzy Device ID. Investigators, it's claimed, linked a specific device identifier to accounts associated with Kvashuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities have asked that Kvashuk be detained, claiming that he may attempt to flee the country or obstruct justice. If convicted of mail fraud, the former Microsoft software engineer could face as much as 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. ®&lt;/p&gt;
