<title>Remembering my father</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;My dad passed away peacefully at home yesterday, surrounded by his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will miss him more than we can express right now. We are feeling grief but also gratitude. My dad’s passing was not unexpected—he was 94 years old and his health had been declining—so we have all had a long time to reflect on just how lucky we are to have had this amazing man in our lives for so many years. And we are not alone in these feelings. My dad’s wisdom, generosity, empathy, and humility had a huge influence on people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gnYoutube_VR_Outer&quot; data-vr=&quot;False&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&quot;whateverIDGEl09lNGJNQ&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEl09lNGJNQ?rel=0&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;playsinline=1&amp;amp;color=white&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; data-yt=&quot;GEl09lNGJNQ&quot; data-vr=&quot;False&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sisters, Kristi and Libby, and I are very lucky to have been raised by our mom and dad. They gave us constant encouragement and were always patient with us. I knew their love and support were unconditional, even when we clashed in my teenage years. I am sure that’s one of the reasons why I felt comfortable taking some big risks when I was young, like leaving college to start Microsoft with Paul Allen. I knew they would be in my corner even if I failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I came to appreciate my dad’s quiet influence on almost everything I have done in life. In Microsoft’s early years, I turned to him at key moments to seek his legal counsel. (Incidentally, my dad played a similar role for Howard Schultz of Starbucks, helping him out at a key juncture in his business life. I suspect there are many others who have similar stories.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad also had a profound influence on my drive. When I was a kid, he wasn’t prescriptive or domineering, and yet he never let me coast along at things I was good at, and he always pushed me to try things I hated or didn’t think I could do (swimming and soccer, for example). And he modeled an amazing work ethic. He was one of the hardest-working and most respected lawyers in Seattle, as well as a major civic leader in our region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad’s influence on our philanthropy was just as big. Throughout my childhood, he and my mom taught me by example what generosity looked like in how they used their time and resources. One night in the 1990s, before we started our foundation, Melinda, Dad, and I were standing in line at the movies. Melinda and I were talking about how we had been getting more requests for donations in the mail. Dad simply said, “Maybe I can help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation would not be what it is today without my dad. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the foundation. He was collaborative, judicious, and serious about learning. He was dignified but hated anything that seemed pretentious. (Dad’s given name was William H. Gates II, but he never used the “II”—he thought it sounded stuffy.) He was great at stepping back and seeing the big picture. He was quick to tear up when he saw people suffering in the world. And he would not let any of us forget the people behind the strategies we were discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who came through the doors of the Gates Foundation felt honored to work with my dad. He saw the best in everyone and made everyone feel special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked together at the foundation not so much as father and son but as friends and colleagues. He and I had always wanted to do something concrete together. When we started doing so in a big way at the foundation, we had no idea how much fun we would have. We only grew closer during more than two decades of working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my dad had a profoundly positive influence on my most important roles—husband and father. When I am at my best, I know it is because of what I learned from my dad about respecting women, honoring individuality, and guiding children’s choices with love and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad wrote me a letter on my 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. It is one of my most prized possessions. In it, he encouraged me to stay curious. He said some very touching things about how much he loved being a father to my sisters and me. “Over time,” he wrote, “I have cautioned you and others about the overuse of the adjective ‘incredible’ to apply to facts that were short of meeting its high standard. This is a word with huge meaning to be used only in extraordinary settings. What I want to say, here, is simply that the experience of being your father has been… incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know he would not want me to overuse the word, but there is no danger of doing that now. The experience of being the son of Bill Gates was incredible. People used to ask my dad if he was the real Bill Gates. The truth is, he was everything I try to be. I will miss him every day.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chuck Feeney Is Now Officially Broke</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/09/15/exclusive-the-billionaire-who-wanted-to-die-brokeis-now-officially-broke/#2d2d3103a2aa</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/09/15/exclusive-the-billionaire-who-wanted-to-die-brokeis-now-officially-broke/#2d2d3103a2aa</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size&quot;&gt;It took decades, but Chuck Feeney, the former billionaire cofounder of retail giant Duty Free Shoppers has finally given all his money away to charity. He has nothing left now—and he couldn’t be happier.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; harles “Chuck” Feeney, 89, who cofounded airport retailer Duty Free Shoppers with Robert Miller in 1960, amassed billions while living a life of monklike frugality. As a philanthropist, he pioneered the idea of Giving While Living—spending most of your fortune on big, hands-on charity bets instead of funding a foundation upon death. Since you can't take it with you—why not give it all away, have control of where it goes and see the results with your own eyes? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We learned a lot. We would do some things differently, but I am very satisfied. I feel very good about completing this on my watch,” Feeney tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. “My thanks to all who joined us on this journey. And to those wondering about Giving While Living: Try it, you'll like it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last four decades, Feeney has donated more than $8 billion to charities, universities and foundations worldwide through his foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies. When I first met him in 2012, he estimated he had set aside about $2 million for his and his wife's retirement. In other words, he's given away 375,000% more money than his current net worth. And he gave it away anonymously. While many wealthy philanthropists enlist an army of publicists to trumpet their donations, Feeney went to great lengths to keep his gifts secret. Because of his clandestine, globe-trotting philanthropy campaign, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; called him the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/09/18/chuck-feeney-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-go-broke/#3c651db291c7&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/09/18/chuck-feeney-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-go-broke/#3c651db291c7&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/09/18/chuck-feeney-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-go-broke/#3c651db291c7&quot; aria-label=&quot;James Bond of Philanthropy&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/09/18/chuck-feeney-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-go-broke/#3c651db291c7&quot;&gt;James Bond of Philanthropy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Feeney has come in from the cold. The man who amassed a fortune selling luxury goods to tourists, and later launched private equity powerhouse General Atlantic, lives in an apartment in San Francisco that has the austerity of a freshman dorm room. When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2018/01/01/looking-for-new-year-inspiration-meet-chuck-feeney-the-james-bond-of-philanthropy/#25f73885651f&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2018/01/01/looking-for-new-year-inspiration-meet-chuck-feeney-the-james-bond-of-philanthropy/#25f73885651f&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2018/01/01/looking-for-new-year-inspiration-meet-chuck-feeney-the-james-bond-of-philanthropy/#25f73885651f&quot; aria-label=&quot;visited&quot;&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, inkjet-printed photos of friends and family hung from the walls over a plain, wooden table. On the table sat a small Lucite plaque&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that read: &lt;em&gt;“Congratulations to Chuck Feeney for $8 billion of philanthropic giving&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's Feeney—understated profile, oversize impact. No longer a secret, his extreme charity and big-bet grants have won over the most influential entrepreneurs and philanthropists. His stark generosity and gutsy investments influenced Bill Gates and Warren Buffett when they launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://givingpledge.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://givingpledge.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://givingpledge.org/&quot; aria-label=&quot;Giving Pledge&quot;&gt;Giving Pledge&lt;/a&gt; in 2010—an aggressive campaign to convince the world’s wealthiest to give away at least half their fortunes before their deaths. “Chuck was a cornerstone in terms of inspiration for the Giving Pledge,” says Warren Buffett. “He’s a model for us all. It’s going to take me 12 years after my death to get done what he’s doing within his lifetime.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeney gave big money to big problems—whether bringing peace to Northern Ireland, modernizing Vietnam’s health care system, or spending $350 million to turn New York’s long-neglected Roosevelt Island into a technology hub. He didn’t wait to grant gifts after death or set up a legacy fund that annually tosses pennies at a $10 problem. He hunted for causes where he can have a dramatic impact and went all-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I worked with the Atlantic Philanthropies on a report titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ZeroIsTheHero.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ZeroIsTheHero.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ZeroIsTheHero.pdf&quot; aria-label=&quot;Zero Is the Hero&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ZeroIsTheHero.pdf&quot;&gt;Zero Is the Hero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which summarized Feeney’s decades of go-for-broke giving. While it contains hundreds of numbers, stats and data points, Feeney summarized his mission a few sentences. “I see little reason to delay giving when so much good can be achieved through supporting worthwhile causes. Besides, it’s a lot more fun to give while you live than give while you're dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f609049f226f950cb2dff5d/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Chuck Feeney signing documents&quot; data-height=&quot;3780&quot; data-width=&quot;5681&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;On September 14, 2020, Chuck Feeney—with wife Helga Feeney—signed documents in San Francisco marking the close of the Atlantic Philanthropies after four decades of global giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;The Atlantic Philanthropies&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 14, 2020, Feeney completed his four-decade mission and signed the documents to shutter the Atlantic Philanthropies. The ceremony, which happened over Zoom with the Atlantic Philanthropies’ board, included video messages from Bill Gates and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent an official letter from the U.S. Congress thanking Feeney for his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its height, the Atlantic Philanthropies had 300-plus employees and ten global offices across seven time zones. The specific closure date was set years ago as part of his long-term plan to make high-risk, high-impact donations by setting a hard deadline to give away all his money and close shop. The 2020 expiration date added urgency and discipline. It gave the Atlantic Philanthropies the time to document its history, reflect on wins and losses and create a strategy for other institutions to follow. As Feeney told me in 2019: “Our giving is based on the opportunities, not a plan to stay in business for a long time.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his philanthropy is out of business, its influence reverberates worldwide thanks to its big bets on health, science, education and social action. Where did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/insights/insights-books/zero-is-the-hero&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/insights/insights-books/zero-is-the-hero&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/insights/insights-books/zero-is-the-hero&quot; aria-label=&quot;$8 billion go&quot;&gt;$8 billion go&lt;/a&gt;? Feeney gave $3.7 billion to education, including nearly $1 billion to his alma mater, Cornell, which he attended on the G.I. Bill.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;More than $870 million went to human rights and social change, like $62 million in grants to abolish the death penalty in the U.S. and $76 million for grassroots campaigns supporting the passage of Obamacare. He gave more than $700 million in gifts to health ranging from a $270 million grant to improve public healthcare in Vietnam to a $176 million gift to the Global Brain Health Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Feeney’s final gifts, $350 million for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell to build a technology campus on New York City’s Roosevelt Island, is a classic example of his giving philosophy. While notoriously frugal in his own life, Feeney was ready to spend big and go for broke when the value and potential impact outweighed the risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chuck Feeney is a true pioneer. Spending down his resources during his lifetime has inspired a generation of philanthropists, including me.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-base quote-embed embed-27 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size bleed&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chuck created a path for other philanthropists to follow. I remember meeting him before starting the Giving Pledge. He told me we should encourage people not to give just 50%, but as much as possible during their lifetime. No one is a better example of that than Chuck. Many people talk to me about how he inspired them. It is truly amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nvidia’s Integration Dreams</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2020/nvidias-integration-dreams/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2020/nvidias-integration-dreams/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2010, Kyle Conroy wrote a blogpost entitled, &lt;a href=&quot;https://conroy.org/apple-stock&quot;&gt;What if I had bought Apple stock instead?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Apple’s stock is at an all time high. A share today is worth over 40 times its value seven years ago. So, how much would you have today if you purchased stock instead of an Apple product? See for yourself in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conroy kept the post up-to-date until April 1, 2012; at that point, my first Apple computer, a 2003 12″ iBook, which cost $1,099 on October 22, 2003, would have been worth $57,900. Today it would be worth $311,973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of this meme, which pops up every time Apple’s stock hits a new all-time high, while considering the price Apple paid for P.A. Semi &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/04/apple-disses-intels-atom-buys-powerpc-designer-pa-semi/&quot;&gt;back in 2008&lt;/a&gt;; for a mere $278 million the company acquired the talent and IP foundation that would undergird its A-series of chips, which have powered every iPad and every iPhone since 2010, and, before the end of the year, at least one Mac (the rest of the line will follow within two years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was curious: what would $278 million in 2008 Apple stock look like today? The answer is $5.5 billion, which, honestly, is still an absolute bargain, and a reminder that the size of an acquisition is not necessarily correlated with its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nvidia Acquires ARM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend Nvidia consummated the biggest chip deal in history when it acquired Arm&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/nvidias-integration-dreams/#footnote_0_5269&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_5269&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;Throughout this article I will write “Arm” when I am referring to the company, and “ARM” when I am referring to said company’s IP&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; from Softbank for around $40 billion in stock and cash. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/13/jensen-employee-letter-arm/&quot;&gt;wrote in a letter to Nvidia employees&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are joining arms with Arm to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Learning from data, AI supercomputers can write software no human can. Amazingly, AI software can perceive its environment, infer the best plan, and act intelligently. This new form of software will expand computing to every corner of the globe. Someday, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet — the internet-of-things — thousands of times bigger than today’s internet-of-people. Uniting NVIDIA’s AI computing with the vast reach of Arm’s CPU, we will engage the giant AI opportunity ahead and advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars, robotics, 5G, and IoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are big ambitions for a big purchase, and Wall Street apparently agrees; yesterday Nvidia’s market cap increased by $17.5 billion, nearly covering the $21.5 billion in shares Nvidia will give Softbank in the deal. Indeed, it is Nvidia’s stock that is probably the single most important factor in this deal. Back in 2016, when Softbank acquired Arm, Nvidia was worth about $34 billion; after yesterday’s run-up, the company’s marketcap was $318 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first takeaway is that selling Arm for $32 billion means that the company was yet another terrible investment by Softbank; simply buying Nvidia shares — or, for that matter, an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund, which is up 55% since then — would have provided a much better return than the ~5% Softbank earned from Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second takeaway is the inverse: Nvidia is acquiring a company that was its marketcap peer four years ago for a relative pittance. Granted, Nvidia’s stock may not stay at its current lofty height — the company has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 67, well above the industry average of 27 — but that is precisely why a majority-stock acquisition makes sense; Nvidia’s stock may retreat, but Arm will still be theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nvidia’s Integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning my analysis with stock prices is not normally what I do; I’m generally more concerned with the strategies and business models of which stock price is a result, not a driver. The truth, though, is that once you start digging into the details of Nvidia and ARM, it is rather difficult to see what strategy might be driving this acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with Nvidia: the company is perhaps the shining example of the industry transformation &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/chips-and-geopolitics/&quot;&gt;wrought by TSMC&lt;/a&gt;; freed of the need to manufacture its own chips, Nvidia was focused from the beginning on graphics. Its TNT cards, released in the late 1990s, provided 3D graphics for games while also powering Windows (previously hardware 3D graphics were only available via add-on cards); its GeForce line, released in 1999, put Nvidia firmly at the forefront of the industry, a position it retains today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in 2001 that Nvidia released the GeForce 3, which had the first pixel shader; instead of a hard-coded GPU that could only execute a pre-defined list of commands, a shader was software, which meant it could be programmed on the fly. This increased level of abstraction meant the underlying graphics processing unit could be much simpler, which meant that a graphics chip could have many more of them. The most advanced versions of Nvidia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-delivers-greatest-ever-generational-leap-in-performance-with-geforce-rtx-30-series-gpus&quot;&gt;just-announced GeForce RTX 30 Series&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has an incredible 10,496 cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of scalability makes sense for video cards because graphics processing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel&quot;&gt;embarrassingly parallel&lt;/a&gt;: a screen can be divided up into an arbitrary number of sections, and each section computed individually, all at the same time. This means that performance scales horizontally, which is to say that every additional core increases performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, though, that graphics are not the only embarrassingly parallel problem in computing. Another obvious example is encryption: brute forcing a key entails running the exact same calculation over-and-over again; the chips doing the calculation don’t need to be complex, they simply need as many cores as possible (this is why graphics cards are very popular for blockchain applications; miners are basically endlessly brute-forcing encryption keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most enticing for Nvidia, though, is machine learning. Training on large datasets is an embarrassingly parallel problem, which means it is well-suited for graphics cards. The trick, though, is in decomposing a machine learning algorithm into pieces that can be run in parallel; graphics cards were designed for, well, graphics, which meant that programmers had to work in graphics programming languages like OpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Nvidia transformed itself from a modular component maker to an integrated maker of hardware and software; the former were its video cards, and the latter was a platform called CUDA. The CUDA platform allows programmers to access the parallel processing power of Nvidia’s video cards via a wide number of languages, without needing to understand how to program graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the kicker: CUDA is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2134/~/how-much-does-cuda-cost%3F&quot;&gt;free&lt;/a&gt;, but that is because the integration is so tight. CUDA only works with Nvidia video cards, in large part because many of the routines are hand-tuned and optimized. It is a tremendous investment that has paid off in a major way: CUDA is dominant in machine learning, and Nvidia graphics cards cost hundreds of dollars ($1500 in the case of the aforementioned RTX 3090). Apple isn’t the only company that understands the power of differentiating premium hardware with software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Arm’s Neutrality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm’s business model could not be more different. The company, founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology, doesn’t sell any chips of its own; rather, it licenses chip designs to companies which actually manufacture ARM chips. Except even that isn’t quite right: most ARM licensees actually contract with manufacturers like TSMC to make physical chips, which are then sold to OEMs. The entire ecosystem is extremely modular; consider an Oppo smartphone, with a MediaTek chip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1-1024x306.png&quot; alt=&quot;The modular smartphone ecosystem&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5270&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1-1024x306.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1-300x90.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1-768x229.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1-1200x358.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-1.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm chips appear in many more devices than smartphones — most micro-controllers in embedded systems are Arm designs — and Arm designs more than CPUs; the company’s catalog includes everything from GPUs to AI accelerator chips. It also licenses less than full designs: Apple, for example, designs its own chips, but uses the ARM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to communicate with them. The ARM ISA is the platform that ties this entire ecosystem together; programs written for one ARM chip will run on all ARM chips, and each of those chips results in a licensing fee for Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Arm’s privileged position viable is the same one that undergirds TSMC’s: neutrality. I wrote about the latter in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/&quot;&gt;Intel and the Danger of Integration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1987, Morris Chang founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) promising “Integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust”. Integrity and customer trust referred to Chang’s commitment that TSMC would never compete with its customers with its own designs: the company would focus on nothing but manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a completely novel idea: at that time all chip manufacturing was integrated a la Intel; the few firms that were only focused on chip design had to scrap for excess capacity at Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) who were liable to steal designs and cut off production in favor of their own chips if demand rose. Now TSMC offered a much more attractive alternative, even if their manufacturing capabilities were behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, though, TSMC got better, in large part because it had no choice: soon its manufacturing capabilities were only one step behind industry standards, and within a decade had caught-up (although Intel remained ahead of everyone). Meanwhile, the fact that TSMC existed created the conditions for an explosion in “fabless” chip companies that focused on nothing but design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-1024x679.png&quot; alt=&quot;Integrated intel was competing with a competitive modular ecosystem&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3572&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-1024x679.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-300x199.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-768x509.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-950x630.png 950w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2.png 1300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the late 1990s there was an explosion in companies focused on dedicated graphics chips: nearly all of them were manufactured by TSMC. And, all along, the increased business let TSMC invest even more in its manufacturing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article was about TSMC overtaking Intel in fabrication, but a similar story can be told about Arm overtaking Intel in mobile. Intel was relentlessly focused on performance, but smartphones needed to balance performance with battery concerns. Arm, which had been spending years designing highly efficient processors for embedded applications, had both the experience and the business model flexibility to make mobile a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result made everyone a winner (except Intel): nearly every smartphone in the world runs on an ARM-derived chip (either directly or, in the case of companies like Apple, the ARM ISA), which is to say that Arm makes money when everyone else in the mobile ecosystem makes money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Nvidia-ARM Mismatch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that an ARM license, unlike the CUDA platform, is not free. That makes sense, though: CUDA is a complement to Nvidia’s proprietary graphics cards, which command huge margins. ARM license fees, on the other hand, can and are paid by everyone in the ecosystem, and in return everyone in the ecosystem gets equal access to Arm’s designs and ISA. It’s not free, but it is neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That neutrality is gone under Nvidia ownership, at least in theory: now Nvidia has early access to ARM designs, and the ability to push changes in the ARM ISA; to put it another way, Nvidia is now a supplier for many of the companies it competes with, which is a particular problem given Nvidia’s reputation for both pushing up prices and being difficult to partner with. Here again Apple works as an analogy: the iPhone maker is notorious for holding the line on margins, prioritizing its own interests, and being litigious about intellectual property; Nvidia has the same sort of reputation. So does Intel, for that matter; the common characteristic is being vertically integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Nvidia is insistent that ARM licensees have nothing to worry about. Huang noted in that letter to Nvidia employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm’s business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm’s IP licensing portfolio with NVIDIA’s world-leading GPU and AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that last bit: Huang is not only arguing that Nvidia will serve Arm customers neutrally, but that Nvidia itself will adopt Arm’s business model, licensing its IP to competitive chip-makers. It’s as if this is an acquisition in reverse: the $318 billion acquirer is fitting itself into a world defined by its $40 billion acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color me skeptical; not only is Nvidia’s entire business predicated on selling high margin chips differentiated by highly integrated software, but Nvidia’s entire approach to the market is about doing what is best for Nvidia, without much concern for partners or, frankly customers. It is a luxury afforded those that are clearly best in class, which by extension means that sharing is anathema; why trade high margins at the top of the market for low margins and the headache of serving everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this deal feels like the inverse of the P.A. Semi deal not simply in terms of the price tag, but in its overall impact on the acquirer. I have a hard time believing that Nvidia is going to change its approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that’s the entire point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Huang’s Dream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the best articulation of the upside of this deal came, unsurprisingly, from Huang. What was notable about said articulation, though, was that it came 46 minutes into &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/NVIDIA-to-acquire-Arm/default.aspx&quot;&gt;the investor call&lt;/a&gt; about the acquisition, and only then in response to a fairly obvious question: why does Nvidia need to own ARM, instead of simply license it (like Apple, which has a perpetual license to the ARM ISA, and is not affected by this acquisition)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was so striking about Huang’s answer was not simply its expansiveness — I’ve transcribed the entire answer below — but also the way in which he delivered it; unlike the rest of the call, Huang’s voice was halting and uncertain, as if he were scared of his own ambition. I know this excerpt is long, but it’s essential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were delightful licensees of ARM. As you know we used ARM in one of our most important new initiatives, the Bluefield GPU. We used it for the Nintendo Switch — it’s going to be the most popular and success game console in the history of game consoles. So we are enthusiastic ARM licensees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why we should buy this company, and we should buy it as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one is this: as you know, we would love to take Nvidia’s IP through ARM’s network. Unless we were one company, I think the ability for us to do that and to do that with all of our might, is very challenging. I don’t take other people’s products through my channel! I don’t expose my ecosystem to to other company’s products. The ecosystem is hard-earned — it took 30 years for Arm to get here — and so we have an opportunity to offer that whole network, that vast ecosystem of partners and customers Nvidia’s IP. You can do some simple math and the economics there should be very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two, we would like to lean in very hard into the ARM CPU datacenter platform. There’s a fundamental difference between a datacenter CPU core and a datacenter CPU chip and a datacenter CPU platform. We last year decided we would adopt and support the ARM architecture for the full Nvidia stack, and that was a giant commitment. The day we decided to do that we realized this was for as long as we shall live. The reason for that is that once you start supporting the ecosystem you can’t back out. For all the same reasons, when you’re a computing platform company, people depend on you, you have to support them for as long as you shall live, and we do, and we take that promise very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we are about to put the entire might of our company behind this architecture, from the CPU core, to the CPU chips from all of these different customers, all of these different partners, from Ampere or Marvell or Amazon or Fujitsu, the number of companies out there that are considering building ARM CPUs out of their ARM CPU cores is really exciting. The investments that Simon and the team have made in the last four years, while they were out of the public market, has proven to be incredibly valuable, and now we want to lean hard into that, and make ARM a first-class data center platform, from the chips to the GPUs to the DPUs to the software stack, system stack, to all the application stack on top, we want to make it a full out first-class data center platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, before we do that, it would be great to own it. We’re going to accrue so much value to this architecture in the world of data centers, before we make that gigantic investment and gigantic focus, why don’t we own it. That’s the second reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third reason, we want to go invent the future of cloud to edge. The future of computing where all of these autonomous systems are powered by AI and powered by accelerated computing, all of the things we have been talking about, that future is being invented as we speak, and there are so many great opportunities there. Edge data centers — 5G edge data centers — autonomous machines of all sizes and shapes, autonomous factories, Nvidia has built a lot of software as you guys have seen — Metropolis, Clara, Isaac, Drive, Jarvis, Aerial — all of these platforms are built on top of ARM, and before we go and see the inflection point, wouldn’t it be great if we were one company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the timing is really quite important. We’ve invested so much across all of these different areas, that we felt that we really had to take the opportunity to own the company and collaborate deeply as we invent the future. That’s the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out this is very much an Nvidia vision after all. Nvidia is not setting out to be a partner, someone that gets along with everyone in exchange for a couple of pennies in licensing fees. Quite the opposite: Huang wants to own it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vision Nvidia’s IP is the CUDA to its graphics chips — the complement to its grander ambitions. Huang has his sights set firmly on Intel, but while Intel has leveraged its integration of design and manufacturing, Nvidia is going to leverage its integration of chip design and software. Huang’s argument is that it is the lack of software — a platform, as opposed to simply a chip or a core — that is limiting ARM in the data center, and that Nvidia intends to build that software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this is exciting for ARM licensees, particularly companies like Amazon that have invested in ARM chips for the data center; note, though, that Nvidia isn’t doing this out of charity. Huang twice mentioned the importance of capturing the upside he believes Nvidia will generate, which ultimately means increased license fees. Sure, Nvidia will be able to make more changes to ARM to suit the data center than they could have as licensor, but the real goal is to tie ARM into an Nvidia software platform until licensees have no choice but to pay what will undoubtedly be ever-increasing licensing fees (which, it should be noted, will still result in chips that less expensive than Intel’s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it will work; data centers are about the density of processing power, which is related to but still different than performance-per-watt, ARM’s traditional advantage relative to Intel, and there are a huge amount of 3rd-parties involved in such a transition. There is a lot about this vision that is out of Nvidia’s control — it’s more of a dream. What is comforting in a way, though, is just how true this dream is to what makes Nvidia unique: this isn’t about adopting ARM’s approach, it’s about co-opting it for a vision of integration that makes Nvidia an object of inevitability, not affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to return to the beginning, it is a bet that is a relatively free one. If Nvidia’s stock is over-priced, then it is buying Arm for an even bigger discount than it seems; the vision Huang laid out, though, is a reason to believe Nvidia’s stock price is actually correct. Might as well roll the dice on a P.A. Semi-type outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three additional notes about this transaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As I noted above, Apple has a perpetual license to ARM. The specific details of this license are unknown — we now know that Apple can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14892/the-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-max-review/2&quot;&gt;extend the ISA&lt;/a&gt; for its own uses — but my understanding is that the terms are locked in. That is why Apple didn’t feel any motivation to acquire ARM itself, even if Nvidia, a company that Apple does not get along with, was the alternative suitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This vision of Arm’s future is in many ways incompatible with ARM’s neutral past, but the truth is Arm is already facing disruption of its own. &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/&quot;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source ISA that is increasingly popular for embedded controllers in particular, in large part because it not only gets rid of Arm control, but also Arm license fees. I would expect investment in RISC-V to accelerate on this news, but it’s worth noting that it is just that — an acceleration of what was inevitable in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest regulatory questions around this acquisition is China. On one hand, China has reason to fear an American company — which is subject to U.S. export controls — acquiring more processor technology. On the other hand, Arm China is actually a joint venture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/dc55d4c9-1065-4db0-98a4-f7f0c1de563b&quot;&gt;the CEO of which has gone rogue&lt;/a&gt;; it’s not clear if Arm is actually in control. It’s possible that this acquisition happens without China’s approval and without ARM China, which is 20% of Arm’s sales. Huang’s dream, though, is perhaps enough to justify this nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_5269&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Throughout this article I will write “Arm” when I am referring to the company, and “ARM” when I am referring to said company’s IP [&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/nvidias-integration-dreams/#identifier_0_5269&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Red flags I saw while doing technical interviews</title>
<link>http://blog.interviewing.io/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.interviewing.io/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, Aline (founder of interviewing.io) here. We’re trying something new. Up till now, all posts on this blog have been written by interviewing.io employees or contractors. Why? Frankly, it’s hard to find great content in the recruiting space. There’s so much fluff and bad advice out there, and we didn’t want any part of that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other day though, I was reading Hacker News and saw&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@meekg33k/14-lessons-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-7732e4f7608d?source=---------4------------------&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;an article by Uduak Obong-Eren about how he did over 60 technical interviews in 30 days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and what he learned from that gauntlet of an experience. I thought it was honest, vulnerable, well-written, and brimming with actionable advice. So, I reached out to him to see if he’d want to write something else. Fortunately, he did, and the article below is the inaugural post in what I hope will become our Guest Author series. You can read more about Uduak in the bio below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick note because this is the first time we’re doing this. One of the things I’m most excited about with this new Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it will bring to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that’s what’s great about. After over a decade in this business, I *still* don’t think there’s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it’s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don’t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, off we go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2683 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uduak-Obong-Eren-Photo-e1600132427566.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uduak Obong-Eren is a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area who is passionate about architecting and building scalable software systems. He has about five years of industry experience and holds a Masters in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He is also an open source enthusiast and writes technical articles – you can view some of his writings at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://meekg33k.dev&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://meekg33k.dev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. He especially enjoys conducting free mock technical interviews to help folks get better at technical interviewing. You can follow him on Twitter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/meekg33k&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@meekg33k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/&quot;&gt;60+ technical interviews in 30 days&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will be sharing some of the red flags I observed while I was on this marathon of technical interviews. I will not be mentioning names of any companies because that’s not the intent behind this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is also not to make you paranoid and be on the hunt for red flags in your next interview, far from it. Rather the goal is to equip you with knowledge to help you immediately identify exactly the same or similar red flags in your next interview&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and hopefully identifying them will set you up to better handle them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the stories I’ll be sharing come from my marathon of &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; interviews, these red flags do not apply only to technical interviews. They apply to all kinds of interviews and so there’s a lot to learn here for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;The Red Flags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Your interviewer is only open to solving the problem ONE way&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computing and in life generally, for any given problem, there is typically more than one way to solve that problem. For example, given a sorting problem, you could solve it using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort&quot;&gt;merge-sort&lt;/a&gt; algorithm or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort&quot;&gt;heap sort&lt;/a&gt; algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having this rich number of techniques to solve a problem makes it even more interesting and the general expectation in technical interviews is that you should have the flexibility to solve a problem using your preferred technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an interview where the interviewer asked me to solve an algorithmic problem. I had started solving the problem using a specific technique when the interviewer stopped me in my tracks and asked that I use another technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I probed a bit further to know why, it appeared that the reason he asked that I used the second wasn’t to test my knowledge of that second technique; it was because he was more ‘comfortable’ with that approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is different if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge of something very specific. For example, given a problem that can be solved using iteration and recursion, the interviewer may want to test your knowledge of recursion and can ask you to solve the problem recursively. That wasn’t the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using both techniques and discussed the trade-offs but frankly that experience left a bad taste in my mouth especially because that interview was with the hiring manager — my would-be manager, who is someone that can significantly influence your career growth and trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Undue pressure to accept an offer letter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very exciting and fulfilling when you go through all preliminary stages of a technical interview, through to the onsite interview (remote or in-person) and then you receive that “&lt;em&gt;Congratulations &amp;lt;insert name here&amp;gt;, we are pleased to offer you…&lt;/em&gt;” email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that excitement often becomes short-lived when there is some form of pressure from your soon-to-be employer to accept the offer. It’s a bit more manageable when the pressure comes from someone in HR or the recruiter, but when it’s from the hiring manager, that can be harder to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the case for me when I interviewed with a startup based in Palo Alto. They were a small company in terms of staff strength. My onsite interview with them had gone quite well. I had a good conversation with the hiring manager and an even better conversation with the VP of Engineering, so much so that I could tell that I was going to be extended an offer. I asked to know how long I had to accept the offer letter and I was told seventy-two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer letter arrived later that evening, and it looked great — a six-figure offer definitely didn’t seem like a bad start. I was also at the final stage of the interview process with other companies too and thankfully, I had enough time to negotiate and accept the offer, or so I thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the pressure started, incessant calls from the hiring manager and the VP of Engineering, back-to-back emails, all within the allotted time. So much was the pressure that it got to a point where I wasn’t sure I wanted to negotiate the offer anymore. I turned down the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned down the offer because the experience got me thinking about the company’s work culture. Were the methods employed by the company to get me to accept the offer indicative of their work culture? If they needed to get something done, how far would they go? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong, yes the company wants to employ you, yes the recruiting team wants to ‘close the deal’ however, it’s very important to pay attention to how the company does this. Do they remain professional about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company’s values go beyond what they say, it shows in what they do and how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Not enough clarity about your role&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many reasons why you would join a company is your desire to be involved in valuable work. I had the opportunity to join a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. They had contracted a recruiting agency to help them find someone to fill a Software Engineer position in their firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiring process started with an exploratory interview with the recruiting agency closely followed by a second interview with a recruiter from the company. In both interviews, I couldn’t get a clear sense of the details of my specific role was — what team I would be on, what kinds of projects I’d be working on, what the career growth pathway was, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that sometimes companies can be going through restructuring, but that didn’t seem to be the case here. It seemed more like the company was focused on completing their headcount. Even though there’s nothing wrong with completing a headcount, I think there is everything wrong with not having a clear purpose for a role for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It means the role may not be critical to the company’s core business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the role isn’t that important, it may mean when a layoff comes, your position may be impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I don’t want to be just a number. I want to work at a place where I have the opportunity to contribute in an impactful way, and I like to believe you would too. So it’s important to get clarity about your role, for where you are today and for future career growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Consistent lack of interest or low morale from interviewers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking to join a company, one of the things you simply must care about is the team you will end up working on. At least 25% of your waking hours will be spent interacting with that team whether in-person or virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews offer you an opportunity to experience firsthand what it will look like to work with your prospective teammates, especially since, unless you’re interviewing at a huge company, your interviewers are likely to become your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If through all the different stages of the interview process, you experience a &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt; lack of interest or low morale from your interviewers, you might want to pay attention . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I experienced that during one of my interviews, I couldn’t exactly tell what the cause was, but I knew something just wasn’t right. After some internal tussle, I decided to trust my gut feelings and ended the interview process with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two months after, two of my interviewers (would-be teammates) had left the company and joined another company (no I wasn’t stalking, I just checked on LinkedIn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not saying that during the interview process, there won’t be one or two people, who because of their busy schedules, would have preferred to be doing something else rather than interviewing. Yet, when all of the interviewers don’t want to be there, you certainly want to pay attention to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of interest or low morale could be pointers to a combination of any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your prospective team-mates may be experiencing burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some internal dissatisfaction with company — culture, policies, something, anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team isn’t that interested in you (hard pill to swallow?), maybe they don’t see you as a long-term hire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or it could be for reasons that I have not included here, but I implore you to not ignore this red flag if you see it in your next interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Your interviewers aren’t prepared for the interview&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been in an interview before where the interviewer doesn’t seem to have any questions to ask you? Trust me it can get really awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my experience during a technical phone-screen interview with an educational technology company based in California. The interviewer wasn’t prepared for our interview and didn’t have any questions at hand. He wasn’t even sure of who he was interviewing and what role I was interviewing for. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are a myriad of reasons why interviewers may not be prepared for an interview. Some of which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of proper planning by the HR/recruiting team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last-minute changes on the interviewee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busy schedules for the interviewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interviewer just wasn’t prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I typically won’t act on this red flag in isolation. I will be looking for other red flags in a bid to form a cluster of patterns before making any decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Lack of a clear direction on where the company is headed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fulfilling to be a part of a company that is involved in meaningful work that creates value for its users. Joining such a company would mean you have the desire to contribute  in helping the organization meet its goals. This invariably means the organization must have some goals right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by a startup based in San Francisco via &lt;a href=&quot;https://angel.co/&quot;&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt;. I had a first introductory call with a recruiter from the company, closely followed by a phone screen technical interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both interviews, even though the interviewers shared some details about the company, there was a lot of vagueness and about the company’s direction and where the company was headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly remember that one question I asked at the time, was about how the company would deal with its growing competition. Sadly, the answers I got didn’t seem convincing and the company later got acquired by the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are interviewing to join a company, you are selling more than just your skills, but also yourself — your unique experience. While it’s important to do that, I think it’s equally important that the company should be able to sell you on its vision and what it hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of joining a company, I picture myself in that company for the next 2–5 years. If my vision for where I want to be in my career doesn’t align with the company’s vision, that is a mismatch that shouldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes focus more on securing the job and even though that is very important, even more important than getting the job is staying fulfilled on the job. &lt;strong&gt;For me, fulfillment meant joining a company that had a clear vision of where they were headed, working in a role that was critical to the company’s business while being equipped with a lot of growth opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these red flags I have shared will equip you to make better decisions on what companies you choose to grow your career with. I would generally not advise making a decision based on one or two red flags, but if you see a cluster of red flags, you shouldn’t ignore them. I wish you the best in your career journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;対して&lt;a href=&quot;https://zen-lang.org&quot;&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt;はコネクトフリー社によって保守されているZigのクローズドソースフォークです。コネクトフリー社は最近Zenコンパイラのためのライセンスモデルを&lt;a href=&quot;https://zen-lang.org/ja-JP/blog/2020-08-20/&quot;&gt;発表&lt;/a&gt;し、ソフトウェア開発者は自分で作成したコードのコンパイル済みリリースを配布する上で年間サブスクリプションの購読が必要になりました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zigプロジェクトとコネクトフリー社の関係性についてコネクトフリー社は完全には明確にしていません。そこで、本声明ではこの関係性について明確にしたいと考えています。日本の皆様がZenコンパイラへの年間ライセンス料を支払う前に、ZigとZenが分岐した背景を知っていただきたいと考えています。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;「&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zen-lang.org/ja-JP/docs/appendix-zig/&quot;&gt;Zigからの発展&lt;/a&gt;」ページにおいて、コネクトフリー社はZenはZigバージョン0.3.0から独立して進化してきたとしており、またZigの貢献者である「No.5」と「No.2」はコネクトフリー社の従業員であり、「No.5」はコネクトフリー社創設者のクリストファー・テイト氏であると述べています。この他に、このページではZenがZigと比較してどのような点で優れているかというバリュー・プロポジションと、開発チームのある種の正統性——彼らが信頼に値する存在だということを示そうとしているようです。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenが独立的に進化してきたという主張については、私どもはクローズドソースであるコンパイラの内部実装についてはコメントできないものの、Zen標準ライブラリのソースコードはZenリリースの度にまだ入手可能です。このソースコードを読むと、コネクトフリー社がZigプロジェクトからいまだに多くのコードを借用していることが簡単に分かります。ほとんどの場合、彼らの命名規則に合わせるために非常に小さな変化を適用しているに過ぎません。この一例として「async/await」機能があります。この機能はZigバージョン0.6.0 (バージョン0.3.0の約1年半後) で導入されましたが、コネクトフリー社によってZenに実質的に全く変更なくコピーされました。もう一つの例として、&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kristoff-it/zenlang-ziglang-eventloop/commit/f67aa04ef081187eb8857e7b5c18c9ed787e0079&quot;&gt;こちらのリンクから二つのイベントループ実装の比較をご覧いただけます&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;開発チームについてのお話をしましょう。「No.5」(すなわちクリストファー・テイト氏) はZigプロジェクトの公共の場であるGitHubとIRCで繰り返し問題のある行動を行ったため、プロジェクトから追放されなければならなくなりました。こうした経緯があることをコネクトフリー社は明らかにしていません。その後、テイト氏は「No.2」をZenコンパイラに取り組ませるために雇いましたが、この契約にあたってプライベートな時間で作られたものも含め「No.2」が書いた全てのコードの所有権がコネクトフリー社にも帰属するという契約内容について&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/2701&quot;&gt;適切に明確化することを怠りました&lt;/a&gt;。その時以来「No.2」はコネクトフリー社の職を辞めましたが、契約の中に示されている「競業避止義務」条項のために、Zigプロジェクトにしばらくのあいだ貢献することもできません。さらに、テイト氏はいくつかのZigコミュニティで宣伝活動を行い、複数のZigコントリビュータをメール経由でスカウトしようとしていたことが知られています。おそらく「No.2」と同じ契約条件で雇おうとしていたものと考えられます。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以下内容は私どもの公式ウェブサイトからの引用で、Zigソフトウェア財団の使命です。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zigソフトウェア財団の使命は、Zigプログラミング言語を促進・保護・発展させること、Zigプログラマーの多様で国際的なコミュニティの成長を支えること、また学生に教育と指導を提供し、次世代のプログラマーを有能かつ倫理的に高い水準を持つ人材へと育成することです。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;コネクトフリー社の創設者であるテイト氏は、&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1530&quot;&gt;不完全な技術論&lt;/a&gt;により彼自身の行動を正当化しようとすると同時に、契約条項を利用してZigの貢献者がこのオープンソースプロジェクトに更に貢献する事を阻止しています。また、コネクトフリー社のZenはZigを表面的にリブランディングしたものに過ぎません。このようなテイト氏の過去と現在の振舞いから、日本の専門家や会社がこうしたクローズドソース製品に頼り生計をたてようとするのは、私どもの良識としてはお勧めできません。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zigのオープンな設計プロセスは協調の精神に基づいており、オープンソース開発を通じてのみ達成可能なレベルの技術的な卓越性と&lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.4.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;圧倒的&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.5.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;な改善&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.6.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;スピード&lt;/a&gt;の実現を目指しています。Zigをユニークで革新的な言語たらしめる多くの特徴 (comptime, async/await, sentinel終端ポインタ型, エラー型等々) は、こうした設計プロセスを進めた結果生まれたものです。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以上より、堅固かつ最適で再利用可能なコードの作成に興味のある日本の開発者の皆様を&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community&quot;&gt;世界的なZigコミュニティ&lt;/a&gt;にお招きしご参加頂く事で、限られた人たちの特権に1円も払う事なく、本物のコードに触れて楽しんで頂きたいと考えております。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;この度は本声明をお読み頂き、誠に有難うございました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindest regards,&lt;br/&gt;Loris Cro - VP of Community&lt;br/&gt;Zig Software Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;【追伸】&lt;br/&gt;私どもは、教材や説明書を日本語含む様々な言語で伝える事にご協力いただける方を探しています。もしご興味がおありでしたら、こちらまでご連絡ください！&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nippon@ziglang.org&quot;&gt;nippon@ziglang.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original English version follows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;100.49988960035&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewkelley.me/&quot;&gt;Andrew Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of Zig, with the goal of supporting the development of the Zig programming language, as well as fostering an equally excellent global community around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zen-lang.org&quot;&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; is a closed-source fork of Zig maintained by connectFree, a company that has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://zen-lang.org/ja-JP/blog/2020-08-20/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a licensing model for the Zen compiler that requires software developers to buy a yearly subscription to distribute compiled releases of their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this statement, we want to clarify to the Japanese public the relationship between the Zig project and connectFree, as the latter hasn’t been entirely forthcoming on the subject matter, and we feel potential customers should know the full picture before spending their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zen-lang.org/ja-JP/docs/appendix-zig/&quot;&gt;Evolution from Zig&lt;/a&gt;” page, connectFree states that Zen has evolved independently from Zig since version 0.3.0 and that Zig contributors “No. 2” and “No. 5” are connectFree employees, with “No. 5” being Kristopher Tate, the founder of connectFree. The page is supposed to provide a value proposition for Zen over Zig, as well as to give some sort of “pedigree” to the development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to the independence argument, while we can’t comment on the closed-source compiler itself, source files for the Zen standard library can still be obtained with every release of Zen. By reading those source files, it’s easy to see that connectFree is still borrowing heavily from the Zig project, often only applying very minor changes to fit their naming conventions. One example of this is the entirety of the new “async/await” functionality, first introduced in Zig version 0.6.0 (roughly 1.5 years after version 0.3.0) and copied with virtually no change by connectFree. As another example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kristoff-it/zenlang-ziglang-eventloop/commit/f67aa04ef081187eb8857e7b5c18c9ed787e0079&quot;&gt;here you can see a comparison between the two event loop implementations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the development team, connectFree omits how “No. 5” (i.e. Kristopher Tate) had to be banned from the Zig project after repeatedly misbehaving in public, both on GitHub and IRC. After that event, Mr. Tate hired “No. 2” to work on the Zen compiler and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/2701&quot;&gt;failed to make it adequately clear&lt;/a&gt; that the contract also granted connectFree ownership of all code written by “No. 2”, even during private hours. Since then, “No. 2” has resigned from their position at connectFree, but won’t be able to contribute to the Zig project for some time because of a “non-compete” clause present in the contract. Mr. Tate has also tried to advertise in some Zig communities and cold emailed multiple Zig contributors about working for connectFree, presumably under the same contractual obligations that “No. 2” was subjected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from our official website, this is the mission of the Zig Software Foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mission of the Zig Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Zig programming language, to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Zig programmers, and to provide education and guidance to students, teaching the next generation of programmers to be competent, ethical, and to hold each other to high standards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given past and present behavior by Mr. Tate, we can’t in good conscience recommend to Japanese professionals and businesses to make their livelihood depend on a closed-source, superficial rebranding of Zig, sold by a company whose founder uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1530&quot;&gt;flawed technical arguments&lt;/a&gt; to justify his actions while leveraging contractual clauses to prevent Zig contributors from further contributing to the open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many features that make Zig a unique and innovative language (comptime, async/await, sentinel-terminated pointer types, error unions, …) are the result of conducting the design process openly, with a collaborative spirit, and with the ultimate goal of reaching a level of technical excellence and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.4.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.5.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/0.6.0/release-notes.html&quot;&gt;improvement&lt;/a&gt; that is only truly achievable in open-source software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of the above, we invite all Japanese developers interested in writing robust, optimal, and reusable code to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community&quot;&gt;the global Zig community&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the real deal, without having to pay a single Yen for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kindest regards,&lt;br/&gt;Loris Cro - VP of Community&lt;br/&gt;Zig Software Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S.&lt;br/&gt;We are looking for contributors to help write learning materials and documentation in other languages, including Japanese. If you are interested, please get in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nippon@ziglang.org&quot;&gt;nippon@ziglang.org&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Schools Should Exclusively Use Free Software (2014)</title>
<link>https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-schools.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-schools.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;Educational activities, including schools of all levels from kindergarten to university, have a moral duty to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/education/education.html&quot;&gt;teach only free software.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;All computer users ought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html&quot;&gt;insist on free software&lt;/a&gt;: it gives users the freedom to control their own computers—with proprietary software, the program does what its owner or developer wants it to do, not what the user wants it to do. Free software also gives users the freedom to cooperate with each other, to lead an upright life. These reasons apply to schools as they do to everyone. However, the purpose of this article is to present the additional reasons that apply specifically to education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free software can save schools money, but this is a secondary benefit. Savings are possible because free software gives schools, like other users, the freedom to copy and redistribute the software; the school system can give a copy to every school, and each school can install the program in all its computers, with no obligation to pay for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This benefit is useful, but we firmly refuse to give it first place, because it is shallow compared to the important ethical issues at stake. Moving schools to free software is more than a way to make education a little “better”: it is a matter of doing good education instead of bad education. So let's consider the deeper issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools have a social mission: to teach students to be citizens of a strong, capable, independent, cooperating and free society. They should promote the use of free software just as they promote conservation and voting. By teaching students free software, they can graduate citizens ready to live in a free digital society. This will help society as a whole escape from being dominated by megacorporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, to teach a nonfree program is implanting dependence, which goes counter to the schools' social mission. Schools should never do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, after all, do some proprietary software developers offer gratis copies&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-schools.html#note1&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt; of their nonfree programs to schools? Because they want to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the schools to implant dependence on their products, like tobacco companies distributing gratis cigarettes to school children&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-schools.html#note2&quot;&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;. They will not give gratis copies to these students once they've graduated, nor to the companies that they go to work for. Once you're dependent, you're expected to pay, and future upgrades may be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software permits students to learn how software works. Some students, natural-born programmers, on reaching their teens yearn to learn everything there is to know about their computer and its software. They are intensely curious to read the source code of the programs that they use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary software rejects their thirst for knowledge: it says, “The knowledge you want is a secret—learning is forbidden!” Proprietary software is the enemy of the spirit of education, so it should not be tolerated in a school, except as an object for reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software encourages everyone to learn. The free software community rejects the “priesthood of technology”, which keeps the general public in ignorance of how technology works; we encourage students of any age and situation to read the source code and learn as much as they want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that use free software will enable gifted programming students to advance. How do natural-born programmers learn to be good programmers? They need to read and understand real programs that people really use. You learn to write good, clear code by reading lots of code and writing lots of code. Only free software permits this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you learn to write code for large programs? You do that by writing lots of changes in existing large programs. Free Software lets you do this; proprietary software forbids this. Any school can offer its students the chance to master the craft of programming, but only if it is a free software school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deepest reason for using free software in schools is for moral education. We expect schools to teach students basic facts and useful skills, but that is only part of their job. The most fundamental task of schools is to teach good citizenship, including the habit of helping others. In the area of computing, this means teaching people to share software. Schools, starting from nursery school, should tell their students, “If you bring software to school, you must share it with the other students. You must show the source code to the class, in case someone wants to learn. Therefore bringing nonfree software to class is not permitted, unless it is for reverse-engineering work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the school must practice what it preaches: it should bring only free software to class (except objects for reverse-engineering), and share copies including source code with the students so they can copy it, take it home, and redistribute it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching the students to use free software, and to participate in the free software community, is a hands-on civics lesson. It also teaches students the role model of public service rather than that of tycoons. All levels of school should use free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a relationship with a school —if you are a student, a teacher, an employee, an administrator, a donor, or a parent— it's your responsibility to campaign for the school to migrate to free software. If a private request doesn't achieve the goal, raise the issue publicly in those communities; that is the way to make more people aware of the issue and find allies for the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;note1&quot;&gt;Warning: a school that accepts such an offer may find subsequent upgrades rather expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note2&quot;&gt;RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company was fined $15m in 2002 for handing out free samples of cigarettes at events attended by children. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/tobaccotrial/usa.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/tobaccotrial/usa.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
