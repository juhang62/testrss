&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn violates their own users' privacy in an effort to detect the usage of browser extensions. At the time of writing this, LinkedIn is scanning visitors for 38 different browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will dive into how LinkedIn detects extensions and what extension developers can do to prevent detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have built an open source browser extension that lists which extensions LinkedIn is currently scanning your browser for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/blob/master/images/demo.gif?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/raw/master/images/demo.gif?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Demo&quot; title=&quot;Nefarious LinkedIn Extension Demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nefarious-linkedin/mpkhbmjfapljfhjopagghpfgbmghjpah&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to install the extension via the Google web store, or you can download any &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prophittcorey/nefarious-linkedin/releases&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from this repository and load it via Chrome's &lt;code&gt;chrome://extensions&lt;/code&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure how to load an unpacked extension, you can see how &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does LinkedIn detect extensions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common ways to detect the usage of a browser extension. The first method is by scanning public resources available in the extension, the other is by analyzing the target web page for abnormal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is currently using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Public Resources&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public resource detection is by far the simplest method to detect the usage of an extension. It is also the easiest to detect as an end user. In fact, it is what turned me on to LinkedIn's nefarious activities to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you browser LinkedIn with your developer console open you may occasionally notice a series of network request errors. If you look at the requests you will notice they are not external requests, rather they are requests to local files. These local files begin with &lt;code&gt;chrome-extension://&lt;/code&gt; which indicates the web page is making requests to files located in your browser itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached a little animated gif showing what these requests look like on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/blob/master/images/spying.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/raw/master/images/spying.gif&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn Spying&quot; title=&quot;LinkedIn Spying&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the presence of an error message indicates the resource was not available and therefore the extension they were looking for is not installed on your browser. If the request succeeded LinkedIn would then know you do have the extension installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Behavioral Patterns&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second method to detect the usage of an extension is by examining the web page itself and identifying any side effects of an extension. LinkedIn is actively using CSS selectors to locate identifying elements on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, they may look for an ID or class used by the extension, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn uses your browser's local storage to store a JSON file that contains a list of extensions to detect. Each extension contains one or more public resources to look for as well as one or more CSS selectors to use to try an detect the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn tries to obfuscate the JSON document but doesn't do a very good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file itself is located in the local storage of your browser under the key &lt;code&gt;C_C_M&lt;/code&gt;. If you look at the contents of the key, you'll see gibberish. The contents are base64 encoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once decoded the contents are further obfuscated. It's clearly a JSON document but the characters are all converted to their unicode byte patterns which makes reading it as a human difficult. If you parse the JSON you can retrieve a human friendly object to examine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself, visit a LinkedIn page, open the inspector and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;atob&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;C_C_M&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the output here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/blob/master/images/localstorage.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/dandrews/nefarious-linkedin/raw/master/images/localstorage.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Local Storage Contents&quot; title=&quot;Local Storage Contents&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the JSON? It's clear they are searching for an element with the id &lt;code&gt;#daxtra-info-div&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you examine the path list in the JSON you can see which public resources they are looking for. In this case: &lt;code&gt;ombdgbngokkngdbcahjbeimfcfimdole/magnet/ChromePlugin/inject/daxtra_info.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, they are trying to identify users with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daxtra-magnet/ombdgbngokkngdbcahjbeimfcfimdole?hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daxtra&lt;/a&gt; extension installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough they try to obfuscate the name of each extension. If you look at the name in the screenshot you can see, &lt;code&gt;wOmysO&lt;/code&gt; which maps to &lt;code&gt;Daxtra&lt;/code&gt;. It is fairly clear the encoded name has gone through a substitution cipher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is enough information in the file to reverse engineer the substitution cipher (which is what I have done in the extension above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other information in the JSON is not so interesting. There's mainly book keeping information such as how often to scan your browser, the current version of the JSON document, which URLs to scan for each extension, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have kept an eye on the document over the last few weeks and I have noticed within the last two weeks the number of extensions LinkedIn is looking for has gone up from 28 to 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips for Extension Developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't use web accessible resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the 38 extensions LinkedIn is currently looking for, 28 are using web accessible resources. This is by far the easiest thing to avoid which greatly helps your users' privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there's no good reason to use web accessible resources in an extension! You can always find a solution to your problem that does not require them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit content script activity to simple reads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is harder to do because it reduces the usefullness of many extensions, but if you want to isolate your extension from the web page you must do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't display your extension using a content script, try a browser action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider using a browser action instead of modifying the page via content scripts. Browser actions run in an isolated environment and makes detecting them much harder if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squirrel icon used by the extension was found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flaticon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt; and is credited to Freepik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Introduction
============

The first public release of bash-5.0 is now available with the URLs

&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/bash-5.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/bash-5.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/bash-5.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/bash-5.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;

and from the master branch of the bash git repository
(&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/log/&quot;&gt;http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/log/&lt;/a&gt;)
and the usual GNU mirror sites.

Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, a complete
implementation of the POSIX shell spec, but also with interactive
command line editing, job control on architectures that support it,
csh-like features such as history substitution and brace expansion,
and a slew of other features.  For more information on the features
of Bash that are new to this type of shell, see the file
`doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a large Unix-style man page.  The
man page is the definitive description of the shell's features. 

This tar file includes the formatted documentation (pdf, postscript,
dvi, info, and html, plus nroffed versions of the manual pages). 

Please use `bashbug' to report bugs with this version.  It is built
and installed at the same time as bash.

Installation
============

Please read the README file first.

Installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.

New Features
============

This is the fifth major release of bash.

Read the file NEWS in the bash-5.0 distribution for a complete description
of the new features.  A copy of the relevant portions is included below. 

This release fixes several outstanding bugs in bash-4.4 and introduces several
new features.  The most significant bug fixes are an overhaul of how
nameref variables resolve and a number of potential out-of-bounds memory
errors discovered via fuzzing. There are a number of changes to the
expansion of $@ and $* in various contexts where word splitting is not
performed to conform to a Posix standard interpretation, and additional
changes to resolve corner cases for Posix conformance.

The most notable new features are several new shell variables: BASH_ARGV0,
EPOCHSECONDS, and EPOCHREALTIME. The `history' builtin can remove ranges of
history entries and understands negative arguments as offsets from the end
of the history list. There is an option to allow local variables to inherit
the value of a variable with the same name at a preceding scope. There is
a new shell option that, when enabled, causes the shell to attempt to
expand associative array subscripts only once (this is an issue when they
are used in arithmetic expressions).  The `globasciiranges' shell option
is now enabled by default; it can be set to off by default at configuration
time.

There are a few incompatible changes between bash-4.4 and bash-5.0. The
changes to how nameref variables are resolved means that some uses of
namerefs will behave differently, though I have tried to minimize the
compatibility issues. By default, the shell only sets BASH_ARGC and
BASH_ARGV at startup if extended debugging mode is enabled; it was an
oversight that it was set unconditionally and caused performance issues
when scripts were passed large numbers of arguments.

Bash can be linked against an already-installed Readline library rather
than the private version in lib/readline if desired.  Only readline-8.0 and
later versions are able to provide all of the symbols that bash-5.0 requires;
earlier versions of the Readline library will not work correctly. 

A complete list of changes between bash-4.4 and bash-5.0 is available in
the file CHANGES; the complete list is too large to include in this
message. 

Readline
========

Also available is a new release of the standalone Readline library,
version 8.0, with its own configuration scripts and Makefiles. 
It can be retrieved with the URLs

&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-8.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-8.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-8.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-8.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;

and from the master branch of the GNU readline git repository
(&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/log/&quot;&gt;http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/log/&lt;/a&gt;)
and the usual GNU mirror sites.

The formatted Readline documentation is included in the readline
distribution tar file.

A separate announcement listing the changes in Readline is being
distributed.

As always, thanks for your help.

+========== NEWS ==========+
This is a terse description of the new features added to bash-5.0 since
the release of bash-4.4.  As always, the manual page (doc/bash.1) is
the place to look for complete descriptions.

1.  New Features in Bash

a. The `wait' builtin can now wait for the last process substitution created.

b. There is an EPOCHSECONDS variable, which expands to the time in seconds
   since the Unix epoch.

c. There is an EPOCHREALTIME variable, which expands to the time in seconds
   since the Unix epoch with microsecond granularity.

d. New loadable builtins: rm, stat, fdflags.

e. BASH_ARGV0: a new variable that expands to $0 and sets $0 on assignment.

f. When supplied a numeric argument, the shell-expand-line bindable readline
   command does not perform quote removal and suppresses command and process
   substitution.

g. `history -d' understands negative arguments: negative arguments offset from
   the end of the history list.

h. The `name' argument to the `coproc' reserved word now undergoes word
   expansion, so unique coprocs can be created in loops.

i. A nameref name resolution loop in a function now resolves to a variable by
   that name in the global scope.

j. The `wait' builtin now has a `-f' option, which signfies to wait until the
   specified job or process terminates, instead of waiting until it changes
   state.

k. There is a define in config-top.h that allows the shell to use a static
   value for $PATH, overriding whatever is in the environment at startup, for
   use by the restricted shell.

l. Process substitution does not inherit the `v' option, like command
   substitution.

m. If a non-interactive shell with job control enabled detects that a foreground
   job died due to SIGINT, it acts as if it received the SIGINT.

n. The SIGCHLD trap is run once for each exiting child process even if job
   control is not enabled when the shell is in Posix mode.

o. A new shopt option: localvar_inherit; if set, a local variable inherits the
   value of a variable with the same name at the nearest preceding scope.

p. `bind -r' now checks whether a key sequence is bound before binding it to
   NULL, to avoid creating keymaps for a multi-key sequence.

q. A numeric argument to the line editing `operate-and-get-next' command
   specifies which history entry to use.

r. The positional parameters are now assigned before running the shell startup
   files, so startup files can use address@hidden

s. There is a compile-time option that forces the shell to disable the check
   for an inherited OLDPWD being a directory.

t. The `history' builtin can now delete ranges of history entries using
   `-d start-end'.

u. The `vi-edit-and-execute-command' bindable readline command now puts readline
   back in vi insertion mode after executing commands from the edited file.

v. The command completion code now matches aliases and shell function names
   case-insensitively if the readline completion-ignore-case variable is set.

w. There is a new `assoc_expand_once' shell option that attempts to expand
   associative array subscripts only once.

x. The shell only sets up BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC at startup if extended
   debugging mode is active. The old behavior of unconditionally setting them
   is available as part of the shell compatibility options.

y. The `umask' builtin now allows modes and masks greater than octal 777.

z. The `times' builtin now honors the current locale when printing a decimal
   point.

aa. There is a new (disabled by default, undocumented) shell option to enable
    and disable sending history to syslog at runtime.

bb. Bash no longer allows variable assignments preceding a special builtin that
    changes variable attributes to propagate back to the calling environment
    unless the compatibility level is 44 or lower.

cc. You can set the default value for $HISTSIZE at build time in config-top.h.

dd. The `complete' builtin now accepts a -I option that applies the completion
    to the initial word on the line.

ee.  The internal bash malloc now uses mmap (if available) to satisfy requests
    greater than 128K bytes, so free can use mfree to return the pages to the
    kernel.

ff. The shell doesn't automatically set BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV at startup
    unless it's in debugging mode, as the documentation has always said, but
    will dynamically create them if a script references them at the top level
    without having enabled debugging mode.

gg. The localvar_inherit option will not attempt to inherit a value from a
    variable of an incompatible type (indexed vs. associative arrays, for
    example).

hh. The `globasciiranges' option is now enabled by default; it can be set to
    off by default at configuration time.

ii. Associative and indexed arrays now allow subscripts consisting solely of
    whitespace.

jj. `checkwinsize' is now enabled by default.

kk. The `localvar_unset' shopt option is now visible and documented.

ll. The `progcomp_alias' shopt option is now visible and documented.

mm. The signal name processing code now understands `SIGRTMIN+n' all the way
    up to SIGRTMAX.

nn. There is a new `seq' loadable builtin.

oo. Trap execution now honors the (internal) max invocations of `eval', since
    traps are supposed to be executed as if using `eval'.

pp. The $_ variable doesn't change when the shell executes a command that forks.

qq. The `kill' builtin now supports -sSIGNAME and -nSIGNUM, even though
    conforming applications aren't supposed to use them.

rr. POSIX mode now enables the `shift_verbose' option.

2.  New Features in Readline

a. Non-incremental vi-mode search (`N', `n') can search for a shell pattern, as
   Posix specifies (uses fnmatch(3) if available).

b. There are new `next-screen-line' and `previous-screen-line' bindable
   commands, which move the cursor to the same column in the next, or previous,
   physical line, respectively.

c. There are default key bindings for control-arrow-key key combinations.

d. A negative argument (-N) to `quoted-insert' means to insert the next N
   characters using quoted-insert.

e. New public function: rl_check_signals(), which allows applications to
   respond to signals that readline catches while waiting for input using
   a custom read function.

f. There is new support for conditionally testing the readline version in an
   inputrc file, with a full set of arithmetic comparison operators available.

g. There is a simple variable comparison facility available for use within an
   inputrc file. Allowable operators are equality and inequality; string
   variables may be compared to a value; boolean variables must be compared to
   either `on' or `off'; variable names are separated from the operator by
   whitespace.

h. The history expansion library now understands command and process
   substitution and extended globbing and allows them to appear anywhere in a
   word.

i. The history library has a new variable that allows applications to set the
   initial quoting state, so quoting state can be inherited from a previous
   line.

j. Readline now allows application-defined keymap names; there is a new public
   function, rl_set_keymap_name(), to do that.

k. The &quot;Insert&quot; keypad key, if available, now puts readline into overwrite
   mode.

<title>The US spends more on healthcare for no gain says new report from Johns Hopkins</title>
<link>https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2018/us-health-care-spending-highest-among-developed-countries.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2018/us-health-care-spending-highest-among-developed-countries.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;January 7, 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Americans on average continue to spend much more for health care—while getting less care—than people in other developed countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States, on a per capita basis, spends much more on health care than other developed countries; the chief reason is not greater health care utilization, but higher prices, according to a study from a team led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper appears in the January issue of &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that the higher overall health care spending in the U.S. was due mainly to higher prices—including higher drug prices, higher salaries for doctors and nurses, higher hospital administration costs and higher prices for many medical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper finds that the U.S. remains an outlier in terms of per capita health care spending, which was $9,892 in 2016. That amount was about 25 percent higher than second-place Switzerland’s $7,919. It was also 108 percent higher than Canada’s $4,753, and 145 percent higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median of $4,033. And it was more than double the $4,559 the U.S. spent per capita on health care in 2000—the year whose data the researchers analyzed for a 2003 study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, along with the late Princeton health care economist Uwe Reinhardt, who died in 2017, came to the same conclusion in their well-known 2003 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12757275&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, “It's the prices, stupid: why the United States is so different from other countries.” The new analysis is in part a tribute to the late Reinhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In spite of all the efforts in the U.S. to control health spending over the past 25 years, the story remains the same—the U.S. remains the most expensive because of the prices the U.S pays for health services,” says lead author Gerard F. Anderson, PhD, a professor in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Health Policy and Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both studies were based on an analysis of health care use and spending in the U.S. and the other industrialized countries that are members of the OECD. The updated study was co-authored by Peter Hussey, PhD, vice president of the RAND Corporation and Dean Varduhi Petrosyan, PhD, of the American University of Armenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson and his colleagues noticed one big difference between 2003 and 2016: a widening of the gap between what public insurers and private insurers pay for the same health care services. In order to lower per capita health care spending, the authors recommend that the U.S. should focus on what private insurers and self-insured corporations pay, since they pay significantly more than public insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that health spending in the U.S. has been growing faster than the other OECD countries in spite of efforts to control spending in the U.S. Overall U.S. health spending increased at an average rate of 2.8 percent annually between 2000 and 2016, which is greater than the OECD median annual increase of 2.6 percent. Per capita, inflation-adjusted spending on pharmaceuticals also increased much more quickly in the U.S.—at a rate of 3.8 percent per year, compared to just 1.1 percent for the OECD median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by only 0.9 percent annually, which means that health care continues to represent a larger share of GDP. U.S. health care spending in 2016 totaled 17.2 percent of GDP, compared to just 8.9 percent for the OECD median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the U.S outspend other OECD countries, on the whole it has less access to many health care resources. The researchers found that in 2015, the most recent year for which data were available in the U.S., there were only 7.9 practicing nurses and 2.6 practicing physicians per 1,000 population, compared to the OECD medians of 9.9 nurses and 3.2 physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the U.S. in 2015 had only 7.5 new medical school graduates per 100,000 population, compared to the OECD median of 12.1, and just 2.5 acute care hospital beds per 1,000 population compared to the OECD median of 3.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the U.S. ranked second in the numbers of MRI machines per capita and third in the numbers of CT scanners per capita—implying a relatively high use of these expensive resources—Japan ranked first in both categories, yet was among the lowest overall health care spenders in the OECD in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that we’re getting more; it’s that we’re paying much more,” Anderson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s Still The Prices, Stupid: Why The US Spends So Much On Health Care, And A Tribute To Uwe Reinhardt,” was written by Gerard Anderson, Peter Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is Your Cat 6 Cable a Dog? (2013)</title>
<link>http://www.bluejeanscable.com/articles/is-your-cat6-a-dog.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bluejeanscable.com/articles/is-your-cat6-a-dog.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Why Your &quot;Cat6&quot; Cable Might be Cat5e -- Or Not Even That&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Category 6 cables -- and to a lesser extent, Category 6a cables -- are widely available from a variety of vendors, including variety stores, office supply stores, consumer electronics stores, and online shops. While a great many people are content to run wireless networks in their homes, the fact is that if you need truly high data speeds and a secure network, nothing beats a wired connection. But is that cable in the store, or in the online shop, really Cat 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a vexing problem, if you've got a cable in a bag and you'd like to know how well it conforms to Category 6 specifications. None of the tools you're likely to own, such as a volt-ohmmeter, will shed any light on the subject. Indeed, if you haven't spent a lot of time digesting cable specifications (we do that here, but it's definitely an acquired taste), you may have no idea at all what makes a cable &quot;Cat 5e&quot; or &quot;Cat 6&quot; or &quot;Cat 6a.&quot; You can pick bulk cable up at the hardware store, and physical examination is rather unrevealing; in fact, the similarities are much greater than the differences, and you may well wonder what makes one bundle of eight little wires better at running high-bitrate data than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, What's the Difference Between Categories?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network cabling, in whatever &quot;Category,&quot; is at root a simple paired-conductor cable design. Signals are sent down each data pair, and the two wires in the pair are twisted together to improve noise rejection and to ensure that they have very similar length; these are important aspects of the cable because signals are sent in a &quot;differential mode&quot; where neither wire is grounded and the receiving circuit has to measure the difference in voltage between the two wires in the pair. Good control over twisting results in excellent &quot;common mode&quot; noise rejection, where noise which affects each conductor equally effectively disappears from the signal, and control over lengths is important both to common mode noise rejection and to keeping the signal from falling apart due to intrapair skew (this is not the &quot;skew&quot; you are likeliest to be familiar with--it's the difference in timing between the two wires in the pair). Because the frequencies involved here are high, the dimensions of the pairs, and their spacing and relationship to other pairs in the bundle, are all important. These attributes of the cable affect its characteristic impedance, which must be kept as stable as possible to prevent signal degradation, because impedance variations cause portions of the signal to reflect within the cable or connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simple features--the physical layout of the cable, the consistency of its dimensions, the rate and consistency of twist--cause a variety of effects upon high frequency signals run through the cable. To perform reliably and up-to-spec, network cabling needs to be able to meet some rather exacting specifications, which relate directly to just that: what happens to high-frequency signals run through it. High-speed data signals are not at all easy to convey reliably from point to point. If you've heard people say that it's very easy to do because, after all, it's digital, and &quot;just ones and zeros,&quot; -- well -- that's one of those ideas which is intuitively very appealing and which turns out to be terribly wrong. To put it simply, the difficulty of actually getting those ones and zeros, at very high bitrates, through a cable and out the other end is surprisingly great, and sometimes for reasons which are far from obvious. In fact, contrary to common belief, it's not even really just ones and zeros--the different encoding schemes involve as many as sixteen distinct signal levels. There are, in fact, very good engineering reasons why data centers are generally not built using the cheapest available imported data cabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Okay--So, How Do We Measure Compliance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Category 5e, 6 and 6a patch cords are governed by specification; the usual spec cited is the TIA spec, TIA-568.C.2, part 6.9, though there is also an ISO spec which is somewhat more stringent. By contrast to the standards that apply to such things as &quot;horizontal&quot; installed cabling and the like, the specification for patch cords is fairly simple. First, it requires that patch cords be built out of cable and connectors which comply with the relevant cable and connector specifications. Second, it requires that the cable meet or exceed performance standards for two things: Near-End Crosstalk, or NEXT, and Return Loss. Both of these attributes measure how much signal degradation a cable causes, and both are highly dependent upon the dimensional characteristics of the cable, which in turn depend upon good manufacturing practices. Consistent drawing and extrusion of the cable, consistent twist rates, and consistent dimensions and materials make for good cable. Additionally, the connectorization of the cable is a major issue: if there is too much untwisting, or other rearranging of the conductors in order to get into the connector, both crosstalk and return loss will suffer; likewise, if the connectors that are used are not up to snuff, they can cause all manner of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with these attributes, some short definitions are in order. Crosstalk is the tendency of the signal in one pair to induce a signal in one of the neighboring pairs, and the specification requires that crosstalk be measured from each pair to each other pair, as crosstalk frequently is much worse between some pairs than others. In particular, due to the unfortunate decision made long ago to make network cable pinouts compatible with telephone wiring pinouts, the pair which is split between pins 3 and 6 (green, in T568B) tends to have higher crosstalk with the pair it passes around, which is on pins 4 and 5 (blue, in T568B). Return loss is the loss caused by signal reflecting when it hits impedance discontinuities in the cable. Both crosstalk and return loss are heavily affected by cable manufacturing quality, and in particular by the internal layout of the cable, the consistency of the dimensions of the pairs, and the consistency of twist rates and spacing. Both crosstalk and return loss are also affected by termination; the worst impedance bump in any cable, well-made or not, is encountered at the connector, and the worst crosstalk performance occurs at the connectors as well because conductors need to be straightened out and, in the case of the 3-6 pair, split up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the difference between Cat 5e, Cat 6, and Cat 6a cable is not so much in the basic design as it is in the tolerances. As the bitrate, and correspondingly the frequency, of the signal increases, smaller and smaller discontinuities and inconsistencies in the cable become relevant. Cat 5e is required to meet certain specs for signals up to 100 MHz (one &quot;Hertz&quot; is one complete wave, e.g., a sine wave, per second, and a &quot;Megahertz&quot; is one million of those per second). Cat 6 is required to meet tighter specifications, and to meet those specs to 250 MHz. Cat 6a must meet the same specifications as Cat 6, but must also meet similar specification limits all the way out to 500 MHz. So, while the basic cable architecture doesn't change between Categories, the demand for consistency and quality in manufacturing does; for example, a sloppy connectorization that's &quot;just good enough&quot; for a Cat 5e cable will almost certainly cause the cable to fail at Cat 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Slippery Side of the Cable Business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that it's hard to tell the difference between Cat 5e, Cat 6 and Cat 6a by looking at them opens the door, unfortunately, to some deceptive practices in the industry. The door is further opened by the fact that, unlike some specifications which have a licensing agency and an enforcement squad (e.g., HDMI Licensing, which licenses the use of the HDMI trademarks and enforces the specification), these Ethernet specs are operated purely on the honor system. If a manufacturer wants to sell &quot;Cat 6&quot; cable, all he has to do is change the jacket lettering on his Cat 5e cable to read &quot;Cat 6.&quot; Beyond that, it's pure &lt;em&gt;caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt; -- it's the buyer's job to figure out whether he's being scammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that somebody would just change the jacket lettering on his Cat 5e cable and call it &quot;Cat 6&quot; might seem just a bit too brazen, even for a sharp operator. If you have just a bit of faith in humanity, you'd think that nobody would label a cable &quot;Category 6&quot; on the jacket and sell it in a major national store chain without ascertaining that the cable actually met Category 6 specifications--but if you thought that, you'd be wrong. A few years ago, Fluke corporation, who make various Ethernet test devices, announced that in its survey of the market approximately 80% of the patch cords sold as &quot;Cat 6&quot; did not meet the specification (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flukenetworks.com/knowledge-base?nid=132399&amp;amp;tid=257&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluke article&lt;/a&gt;). This can be a severe problem in data networks, even when the permanent link cabling is of high quality -- for more detail on this point see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flukenetworks.com/content/truths-about-twisted-pair-patch-cables&quot;&gt;this excellent Fluke online presentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ugly Truth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we began work to develop our own Cat 6 and Cat 6a cables, we knew we would need to test every assembly; while Cat 5e cables are easy to assemble without a lot of cause for worry over compliance, Cat 6 and Cat 6a are another matter. Defects in assembly that one barely notices when putting the connector on -- things like just a bit too much split of the members of a pair, or too-abrupt bends in conductors as they route into the connectors -- can cause failure. Near-End Crosstalk and Return Loss are both sensitive to termination quality, and a failure of either means failure to meet spec. Accordingly, we invested in a Fluke &quot;certification tester,&quot; model DTX-1800. The DTX is basically a purpose-built network analyzer programmed to evaluate network cables; instead of needing to do four passes through a network analyzer to evaluate return loss on the pairs, and then six more passes to evaluate crosstalk between all pair combinations, the operator can just press a button and the DTX runs all of those tests, sweeping through the whole range of frequencies and measuring the cable's compliance with relation to the specification. You can see a sample report, and explanation of what it means, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluejeanscable.com/networkcablereports.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this page.&lt;/a&gt; The Fluke is a lovely piece of gear. We'd tell you that everyone who ever uses network cable should have one, if the unit with its various patch cord adapters didn't cost over $12,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluke's claim that 80% of so-called Cat 6 patch cords were noncompliant seemed surprising, and we wondered whether things had gotten any better -- surely they had? -- since then. With the DTX on the desktop, this became a fairly easy question to answer, and we decided to go shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's have a look at some Ethernet cables in common circulation. We've gone around and purchased a variety of patch cords that were labelled &quot;Cat 6&quot; and &quot;Cat 6a&quot; from four brick-and-mortar and four online vendors, and we've tested these on the DTX against the actual spec. We don't want to get a sheaf of letters from lawyers threatening litigation over our publication of these results, and so have made the decision to keep the vendors, and the brand names, anonymous (and please don't ask us about it over the phone; the individual who performed the testing has intentionally not informed the others at our office as to who these vendors are, or which results correspond to which vendor). What we will say, however, is that this is very, very far from being a list of no-name fly-by-night offshore vendors. These are serious, large companies with well known names and with reputations to lose, and if you are a US resident familiar with places to buy cable on the street and online, you know and probably have purchased something (even if not a cable) from most if not all of them. We did not cherry-pick these results; every cable we tested is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of quick testing notes: we used the TIA specification (easier than ISO) for all of the Cat 6 and 5e testing below. For 6a, our tester supports only ISO, so we used ISO there. Also, we have in a couple of cases noted &quot;marginal pass&quot; results; what this means is that while the cable passed testing, it did so by a margin narrower than the tester's margin of error. All of the test reports, in .pdf form, are linked to the result column and, where applicable, the &quot;Additional Tests, Notes&quot; column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Well, That Wasn't Very Good, Was It?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn't. A few observations are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, of course, the near-unanimity of the results is pretty surprising. Out of twenty cables tested, four met spec, and of those, two did it by a hair. This 80% failure rate is, as it happens, exactly what Fluke reported a few years back, and our sample certainly shows no improvement over that time. Plainly enough, most of these cables aren't designed to meet Cat 6 or 6a specifications, and they're certainly not tested for compliance before leaving the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the results is that, out of the sixteen cables which failed their stated spec, all but five also failed Cat 5e testing. Cat 5e is not a difficult standard to pass; using conventional, non-bonded, twisted-pair Cat 5e of good quality (e.g., Belden 1583A) and ordinary RJ-45 connectors, not only is it easy to build compliant Cat 5e assemblies, but it's common to see them pass the specification by several dB both on NEXT and RL. Contrast that with some of the shockingly bad test results--e.g., the 50-foot major-brand cable from the hardware store, which failed the 5e spec's return loss requirements by a whopping 8 dB. Plainly, many of these vendors are using very, very poor cable stock. Anybody with an extruder and a wire-twisting machine can make paired data cables; making them meet spec, however, is another matter entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that of all of the brick-and-mortar store cable purchases we made, the grand total score is zero passes, eight fails with only two of the purportedly &quot;Cat 6&quot; cables even passing Cat 5e. That's shameful, and what it means is that there is a good chance that, in your community, there is not a single place you can go and buy an honest-to-gosh Cat 6 patch cable; the closest you can come is to buy a cable that says &quot;Cat 6&quot; on the package and which may, if you're lucky, be Cat 5e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online vendors didn't do all that much better, though there are some passes amid the fails. We found no vendors who consistently passed, but some who consistently failed. What this suggests is that even those who do a better job than the others fail to consistently test their assemblies against the specification, and whether any particular assembly passes the spec is purely a guess unless you've got the gear to check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had a few calls and contacts from people who really just do not believe the testing results above. Surely, they think, it can't be that bad, because data professionals who build server farms have got to rely upon quality patch cords. But it really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that bad, and when we talk to people who build data centers, one of the things we hear often is that the quality of commonly-available patch cords is very poor. There are other companies, like us, who build individually-certified patch cords for data networks, but we don't know of &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; else who does that for the consumer market. If you're buying a thousand patch cords through a professional electronic, broadcast or data supply house, yes, you can get quality patch cords; but unless that's the business you're in, chances are that you wouldn't recognize the names of the vendors or the manufacturers of those cords, and you won't find them at the typical consumer-market price-driven cable vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sales pitch at this point seems a bit obvious, if not redundant, so we'll keep it short. With every Cat 5e, Cat 6, or Cat 6a cable we sell, you will receive the test report for your cable, run on the same test apparatus on which these cables were tested, and confirming that your cable meets the specification. If we build a cable that doesn't pass, it doesn't ship.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Supporting open source with 3% of our revenue</title>
<link>https://blog.geteventbot.com/2019/01/06/how-we-support-open-source-software.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.geteventbot.com/2019/01/06/how-we-support-open-source-software.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: We’re donating 3% of our revenue to fund important open source projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1266306/50743445-e08f5080-11cc-11e9-893b-09160b0cef31.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;redwood open source&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source software is critical to our lives, as the internet relies heavily on projects built by legions of good-willed developers. In business, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/open-source-software-enterprise&quot;&gt;78% of companies&lt;/a&gt; utilize open source in their organization. However, most companies see open source software as a simple cost reduction - get software functionality without spending money on development. Sadly this ignores the countless humans who dedicate their time and energy to maintain and grow these projects. Not only is this unsustainable in the long run, but it diminishes the great work of these open source developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team at Eventbot think it’s critically important to support open source and more specifically, the people who make it all possible. &lt;strong&gt;So we’ve decided to dedicate 3% of our revenue into the open source projects we rely on.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a bit of an experiment, as we are a small startup but we feel it’s important to set an example and help the teams that are contributing to our own success. Among the open source projects we’re donating to, we’re big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://node-postgres.com/&quot;&gt;Node-Postgres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;GulpJS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nearley.js.org/&quot;&gt;Nearley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullcalendar.io/&quot;&gt;Full Calendar.&lt;/a&gt; These projects provide a significant value to us, enabling us to deliver Eventbot to our users around the world. Plus, we just felt like these projects were could really use more financial support. Our plan is re-evaluate our contributions every 6 months to increase the dollars we contribute and review new projects we might be using internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who use Eventbot will never know about what open source projects are used to deliver their service, and that’s fine. But we can do our part to ensure these project maintainers get some financial assistance and recognition for their efforts. In the long run, we hope the software industry find a more long term approach to open source funding, because donations can only go so far. But until then - we stand on the shoulders of giants who’ve come before us so we gladly contribute to a more sustainable open source future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a favorite open source project that needs additional support? &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.geteventbot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new&quot;&gt;Let us know!&lt;/a&gt; We’d love to hear from you! 💌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether your interest is in winning arguments online or considerably deepening your knowledge of world cultural and intellectual history, you will be very well-served by at least one government agency from now into the foreseeable future. Thanks to the expiration of the so-called &quot;Micky Mouse Protection Act,&quot; the U.S. Copyright Office will release a year’s worth of art, literature, scholarship, photography, film, etc. into the public domain, starting with 1923 this year then moving through the 20th century each subsequent year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to the venerable online institution the Internet Archive, we already have almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=date%3A1923+AND+mediatype%3Atexts+AND+NOT+collection%3Aopensource+AND+scanningcenter%3A%2A&amp;amp;sort=-downloads&quot;&gt;11,000 texts from 1923 in multiple digital formats&lt;/a&gt;, just a click or two away.&lt;/p&gt;

(It does include William Butler Yeats.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1059786&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;783&quot; height=&quot;628&quot; srcset=&quot;http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks.png 783w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks-240x192.png 240w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks-360x289.png 360w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks-768x616.png 768w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225210/Leonardos-Notebooks-300x241.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1923 turns out to have been a particularly rich literary year itself, with many of the 20th century’s finest writers publishing major and lesser-known works (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_in_literature#New_books&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/popular_by_date/1923&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example). Browsing and focused searching &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=date%3A1923+AND+mediatype%3Atexts+AND+NOT+collection%3Aopensource+AND+scanningcenter%3A%2A&amp;amp;sort=-downloads&quot;&gt;through the archive&lt;/a&gt;—by topic, collection, creator, and language—will net many a literary classic or overlooked gem by some famous author. But you’ll also find much in this enormous collection of digitized books that you would never think to look for, like browsing the shelves of a Borgesian university library with an entire wing devoted to the year 1923.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1059787&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225224/thomsirishwhoswh00dubl_0142.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;544&quot; height=&quot;889&quot; srcset=&quot;http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225224/thomsirishwhoswh00dubl_0142.jpg 544w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225224/thomsirishwhoswh00dubl_0142-147x240.jpg 147w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225224/thomsirishwhoswh00dubl_0142-220x360.jpg 220w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/01/03225224/thomsirishwhoswh00dubl_0142-300x490.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/index.php&quot;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; looks as modest as it does dedicated, listing all of its top collections rather than foregrounding &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=date%3A1923+AND+mediatype%3Atexts+AND+NOT+collection%3Aopensource+AND+scanningcenter%3A%2A&amp;amp;sort=-downloads&quot;&gt;the huge tranche of newly-available material (and counting) on the 1923 shelves&lt;/a&gt;. But founder Brewster Kahle does not mince words in describing its incredible importance. “We have shortchanged a generation,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;, “The 20th century is largely missing from the internet” (in legally available form, that is). Now and in the coming years, thousands of its stories can be told by teachers, scholars, artists, and filmmakers with ever-broadening access to documentary history.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Choose a Startup to Work for by Thinking Like an Investor</title>
<link>https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-startup-to-work-for</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-startup-to-work-for</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that most advice on choosing a startup to work for is wrong. Early employees at wildly successful startups suggest you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rabois/status/679722946919677952&quot;&gt;assume the value of your equity is zero&lt;/a&gt; and instead optimize for &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-with-gmail-creator-and-y-combinator-partner-paul-buchheit&quot;&gt;how much you can learn&lt;/a&gt;. In this post I'll argue that evaluating how likely a startup is to succeed should actually be the most important factor in your decision to join one. As a former partner at Y Combinator, I know a lot about how investors do this. Now, as a founder and CEO of Triplebyte, I see how much less rigor the average job seeker applies to their decision and what they miss that investors would notice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you should be sure you really want to work at a startup. This is not the right choice for everyone. Paul Buchheit, an early engineer at Google, says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you're happy working where you are, and you don't have any ambition to do anything else, you're probably going to get paid less and work more if you leave [for a startup]. If getting paid less and working more is unappealing to you, then I would recommend staying where you are!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining a startup means giving up greater liquid compensation today for the chance of gaining other things that accumulate value over time. Things like personal networks, learning opportunities and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can learn new things and meet people working at any startup. However you will learn significantly more, build a stronger network, and accelerate your career trajectory much faster by joining a successful startup than an average one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful startups attract the best resources in every category as they grow. They'll get the best investors, press coverage, and hire the best talent. The latter is especially important for your career. Initially, founders can only recruit talent from the limited pool of people who have the risk tolerance to join something early. As the startup succeeds, this pool grows and it becomes a magnet for the best talent. By joining early, you get to work alongside the smartest people and solve problems together without several layers of management between you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also only by joining a successful startup early that you can get remarkably steep career trajectories, like Jeff Dean, Marissa Mayer or Chris Cox. Successful startups grow faster than they can hire experienced and qualified people to keep up with growth. This creates vacuums of responsibility, vacuums that existing employees who might be “under qualified” on paper can step in and fill. If you fill the vacuum well, you can keep repeating until you rise up into the highest levels of leadership of what will eventually become a public company. Even if you leave before reaching those levels, there's a halo effect around you now. Companies will roll out the red carpet to hire you, and investors will be keen to fund your startup ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Choose a Startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've decided to join a startup, the first obvious thing to look for is any evidence that it is already succeeding. This is what investors do. Unfortunately, at the early stages there's usually not much data like this. When there is, one thing we learned at YC was not to be fooled by large absolute numbers. What matters most is the growth rate. A startup with $1 million in monthly revenue which has been flat for the past year is less exciting than one with $100,000 in monthly revenue that was at $0 six months ago. You care about the trajectory a startup is on, not just where it is at this moment in time. Joining Facebook in 2006 would have been a better choice than Myspace even though the latter had more users at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to evaluate the strength of the team and market. At the earliest stage, the team is just the founders. It's difficult to evaluate startup founders using traditional signals like college or work history. In fact, the kind of experience that looks good on a resume can be a negative signal for being suited to founding a company. Rising up the ranks at Google might mean you can only thrive in a well-structured environment working on a product with millions of users. Neither of those conditions apply to startups. However, it may also signal an outlying level of competence and competitiveness. Those are both good traits for a startup founder. That's what makes this so hard. There's not a single clearly defined shape of person you're trying to identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to focus on how impressive the accomplishments of the founders are relative to their peer group and environment. Starting a company and convincing investors to invest is an accomplishment that contains signal. It contains more signal if achieved by a 19 year old college dropout from Milwaukee than a Stanford computer science graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to evaluate how well a founder understands the problem they're working on. Being an expert in the domain yourself makes this easy. You know exactly which questions to ask someone to call bullshit. If you're not, then take the approach of asking the founders to teach you about the problem they're working on. Be intellectually curious and see how well they can explain product choices they've made, how the market works, and who their competitors are. I particularly like asking what has surprised them since starting the company and which early assumptions turned out to be wrong. I would be suspicious if they claim every assumption turned out to be completely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the relationship between founders is as important as evaluating the founders themselves. The top cause of startup death during a Y Combinator batch was cofounder disputes. We evaluated this very closely during interviews. We were looking for red flags such as talking over each other and disagreeing on important issues. It was a particularly bad sign if it wasn't clear who the CEO was. Likewise it was a bad sign if, when asked, one person meekly answered they were the CEO while the other glared at them. I'd recommend you request to meet the cofounders together to answer your questions so you can feel out this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also get valuable data about the startup from the team that has been hired. They may know about any red flags or major issues the company is facing which the founders haven't told you about. This data is especially valuable because it is the hardest to get. Once you receive an offer, ask anyone you met during the interview to meet you for coffee. Then ask them hard questions such as, what are the biggest weaknesses of the founders? How have conflicts been handled? What major problems has the company faced thus far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an engineer, I'd also ask specific questions around how product ideas are generated and work is assigned. Do not look for a perfectly smooth and egalitarian process here. I believe early stage startups work better as benevolent dictatorships. You want at least one of the founders to have strong product opinions and be the final product decision maker. Early on, speed of action matters most to a startup, and decisiveness is a good trait in startup founders because it creates motion. Don't miss out on joining a great early stage startup because the founder seemed too opinionated and involved in product decisions early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also judge the quality of the product but don't always look for a perfect product. An imperfect product with bugs is fine if the team can explain why it still delivers a better experience than competitors. Moving quickly to launch software and sacrificing some amount of quality to gain users in a new or emerging market is a good strategy for a startup. This same tradeoff does not apply if the startup is in a crowded space with large incumbents who already have pretty decent products. &lt;a href=&quot;http://airtable.com/&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; is a good recent example of a product that has seen success launching in a crowded market by taking time to build and iterate on the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you need to evaluate how promising the market is. I won't cover how to do deep analysis of market size here. Estimating the true market size is an exercise composed of some parts rigorous analysis, guesswork, and persuasion. What is important is identifying the type of market the startup is in. There are two types of market for a startup. The first is a new market that is growing quickly e.g. blockchain. The second is an already known and large market with existing large incumbents e.g. real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of market a startup is in should also impact how you evaluate the strength of the team and product. Being the first mover in a new and growing market has huge advantages which can cover up a lot of deficiencies in both the team and the product. If it is early enough, investors won't have funded many competitors yet. If you believe strongly in the growth potential of a market and find a startup that is currently in the lead you can afford to be more forgiving on the quality of the team and product. If the startup grows, both will be upgraded anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating in a market which is already known to be large and valuable will be less forgiving. There will be many well-funded competitors, and you'll need an exceptional team with access to capital and a correct vision for differentiation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendoor.com/&quot;&gt;Opendoor&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was not an average founding team. Co-founder Keith Rabois was an early team member at several startups that went public, such as LinkedIn, Paypal and Square. CEO Eric Wu had deep domain expertise after founding and selling a real estate startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply joining any startup won’t provide you with great learning opportunities or a strong personal network by default. A startup on a flat growth trajectory with a weak team offers neither. A consequence of this is being willing to move startups if the one you are currently at stops growing. I think startup employees should re-evaluate the growth trajectory of their startup every year. I’m conflicted in offering this advice. As the founder of a hiring marketplace, more people looking for jobs each year increases our market size. As the founder and CEO of a startup, I want my employees to stay with us for a long time and have faith during the inevitable rough patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a balance here. Every startup faces challenges, and if you're quick to jump ship you might give up a lot of upside. As a personal anecdote, my first startup was given an acquisition offer by Facebook in 2007. We declined in favor of taking another deal because Facebook seemed like a chaotic organization at the time with a lot of executive turnover and the conventional wisdom said it was overvalued. In hindsight, it may not have been a bad decision to join and stick through a temporarily turbulent time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting startup success is hard, and even professional investors fail at it most of the time. My advice here is intended to make you think more like them, in the hope that you'll build a portfolio of experiences over time that will maximize both your learning and your earnings. Good luck!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Elad Gil, Ammon Bartram and Charlie Treichler for reading early drafts of this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How to Choose a Startup to Work For by Thinking Like An Investor</og:title>
<og:description>I believe that most advice on choosing a startup to work for is wrong. Early employees at wildly successful startups suggest you assume the value of your equity is zero (https://twitter.com/rabois/status/679722946919677952) and instead optimize for how much you can learn (https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-with-gmail-creator-and-y-combinator-partner-paul-buchheit). In this post I'll argue that evaluating how likely a startup is to succeed should actually be the most important factor in your decision to join one. As a former partner at Y Combinator, I know a lot about how investors do this. Now, as a founder and CEO of Triplebyte, I see how much less rigor the average job seeker applies to their decision and what they miss that investors would notice.</og:description>

<title>Announcing unlimited free private repos</title>
<link>https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29592817/50617647-e676f000-0eb3-11e9-992d-0eb11d29f8e0.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub announces unlimited private repos&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re announcing two major updates to make GitHub more accessible to developers: unlimited free private repositories, and a simpler, unified Enterprise offering. We’re excited about these updates to our Free and Enterprise offerings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5.9122257053292&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Free&lt;/strong&gt; now includes unlimited private repositories. For the first time, developers can use GitHub for their private projects with up to three collaborators per repository for free. Many developers want to use private repos to apply for a job, work on a side project, or try something out in private before releasing it publicly. Starting today, those scenarios, and many more, are possible on GitHub at no cost. Public repositories are still free (of course—no changes there) and include unlimited collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.8718535469108&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt; is the new unified product for Enterprise Cloud (formerly GitHub Business Cloud) and Enterprise Server (formerly GitHub Enterprise). Organizations that want the flexibility to use GitHub in a cloud or self-hosted configuration can now access both at one per-seat price. And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-16-future-of-software/#business&quot;&gt;GitHub Connect&lt;/a&gt;, these products can be securely linked, providing a hybrid option so developers can work seamlessly across both environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pricing&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pro (formerly GitHub Developer) and GitHub Team are also available for developers and teams who need professional coding and collaboration features. And of course, open source contributors will still have everything they need to collaborate on public repositories, including our free version of GitHub Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a student about to write your first line of code, an enterprise leader with teams around the world, or an open source maintainer, we want GitHub to be the best place for you to code, collaborate, and connect with the global community of developers. Today’s changes are a big investment in the future of GitHub, and we’re excited to see what you build in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tennessee doctors earn big money denying disability claims</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;lf-social-bookmark-header&quot;&gt;Share This Story&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;By the time Alan Chrisman was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer, he was too sick to work. The cancer had spread to his lungs. His doctors said he may never get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;Chrisman, 59, applied for disability, the federal safety net program he contributed to with every paycheck during his 30 years working as a stonemason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;But a doctor hired by Tennessee’s Disability Determination Services to review applications quickly concluded Chrisman wasn’t sick enough to get the $804 monthly benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;That physician, Dr. Thomas Thrush, is one of about 50 doctors contracted to review applications for Tennesseans seeking disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;module-position-ReEoFXDGA4s&quot; class=&quot;story-asset video-asset&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui-video-controls video story-video inline-story-video&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;video-desc&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;How some doctors earn big money denying disability claims &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Michael Schwab, Nashville Tennessean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The doctors are paid a flat rate for each application file they review. How much they earn depends on how fast they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thrush, like many of the doctors who contract with the state, works very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In fiscal year 2018, he reviewed — on average — one case every 12 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thrush’s productivity has paid off. He earned $420,000 for reviewing the applications of 9,088 Tennesseans applying for disability during the year ending June 30. He has made more than $2.2 million since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;On average, 80 percent of the cases he reviewed were denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 takeaways from this investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/investigations/2019/01/06/tennessee-disability-claims-denials-appeals-investigation/2473381002/&quot;&gt;Doctors speed through disability claims, make millions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Tennessee has among the highest denial rates for disability applicants in the nation, rejecting 72 percent of all claims in 2017. The national average for denials was 66 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Outside experts and former and current state employees say it’s impossible to review cases so quickly without making mistakes that lead to wrongful rejections of disability benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In Chrisman’s case, Thrush failed to obtain one critical piece of evidence: a discharge paper from a hospital that stated Chrisman’s cancer was inoperable and had metastasized. The prognosis clearly qualified him for disability, even under the complex rules set by the Social Security Administration. The mistake was discovered only after Chrisman hired a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee investigation examined 5½ years of data for physicians and psychologists who review disability applications. The investigation found that between January 2013 and July 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Some doctors raced through cases&lt;/strong&gt;. More than half of all contract physicians outpaced the federal standard of 1.5 cases per hour, and 1 out of every 5 doctors doubled that pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;A whistleblower was fired&lt;/strong&gt;. The contract of a former medical consultant was terminated in 2017 after he raised concerns about some physicians reviewing a high volume of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Speed pays&lt;/strong&gt;. Seven high-volume doctors billed for more than $1 million each between fiscal 2013 and 2018. These physicians’ annual payments range from $103,000 to $451,000. By contrast, the acting chief of the Social Security Administration, a Cabinet-level position, earned $240,000. For some physicians, this was not their sole source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Staff doctors take more time&lt;/strong&gt;. The state employed a small number of staff doctors whose compensation is not tied to the number of cases they review. These doctors reviewed cases at a rate that is in line with federal recommendations. They typically earned less than $150,000 annually, according to the state’s salary database. Beginning this year, however, the state is terminating all doctors on salary and relying only on contract physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Some doctors have a history of misconduct&lt;/strong&gt;. At least two doctors under contract with the state are felons, including Thrush. Two other physicians had their medical licenses placed on probation. Another physician had his license revoked twice in the past 20 years and now works on a restricted license that bars him from treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Five current and former contractors and state employees said they believe disability applicants are being wrongfully denied in an effort to process as many applications as possible. Most spoke to The Tennessean on the condition of anonymity, for fear of reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“It’s like a cash register,” said one contract physician. “From our perspective it’s unethical. From a consumer’s point of view it can be a tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;One doctor who raised the issue through official channels lost his contract. Dr. John Mather, the whistleblower, was the former chief medical officer for disability programs at the federal Social Security Administration, and worked as a contract doctor for the state after he retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“Who knows how many applicants for disability benefits have had their applications denied without justification,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISABILITY DATABASE:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://data.tennessean.com/tennessee-office-of-disability-determination-services-medical-consultants-2013-2018/&quot;&gt;Click here to see doctors, how many patients they've processed and how much they earn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A whistleblower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Mather said he warned James Stanfield, director for the state disability department, and Raquel Hatter, then commissioner of the Department of Human Services, in 2016 about the dangers of some doctors performing large numbers of reviews. The Human Services Department’s general counsel responded in a letter saying there was nothing illegal or fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Mather emailed the Social Security Administration, which referred the matter to the Office of Inspector General. That office determined no investigation was warranted. Mather met with auditors at the Comptroller of the Treasury, then received no further response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In 2017, Stanfield declined to renew Mather’s contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“I don’t think they care about the claimant,” Mather said of administrators. “They just want to see the cases out. I don’t think they care too much about quality. People who are high producers — they are very happy to have them around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Current and former personnel said they were speaking up now because they want an outside investigator to review all cases to ensure individuals have not been wrongly denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“These findings are troubling,” Tennessee U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper said in a statement. “Physicians, especially those dealing with state and federal funds, should be careful and thorough in their work. Social Security Disability Insurance is a vital program, and we have to keep it strong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A spokesman for the Department of Human Services, which oversees the disability program in Tennessee, disputed any connection between how fast doctors review case files and their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“We have no reason to believe that doctors that average faster reviews are more prone to have errors in their reviews,” Sky Arnold said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The Social Security Administration provided its own statistics that showed Tennessee doctors were spending on average 47 “medical minutes per case.” Patti Patterson, a spokeswoman, noted that was more than the national average of 38 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;But the federal data adds the time multiple physicians spend reviewing the same case, a common occurrence when someone is claiming both a mental and physical disability requiring two different specialists. The state data analyzed by The Tennessean details each doctor’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A letter brings crushing news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;For weeks, Chrisman did not feel well. Some days he would lose control of his bowels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;After stonemason work became scarce, he got a job as a maintenance man at a McDonald’s in Sevierville, Tennessee, two years ago. One day in November 2017, he showed up to work at the restaurant and promptly soiled himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;At the insistence of his wife, Joyce, he headed straight to a walk-in clinic. It was his first medical visit in a long time. The Chrismans cannot afford insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;He was referred to a doctor, then another. The diagnosis was swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Chrisman had late-stage cancer of the intestine. The cancer had spread. There were two spots on his lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A golf ball-sized tumor and about a foot of his intestine were removed in surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;module-position-ReEoFXC7qoo&quot; class=&quot;story-asset image-asset&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; class=&quot;wide single-photo&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;url&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/08/31/PNAS/56dad4bb-a2ac-4d6c-8a58-6202abd73b1d-NAS-DisabilityDenials_0001.JPG?width=2352&amp;amp;height=1764&amp;amp;fit=bounds&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; alt=&quot;Alan Chrisman worked as a maintenance employee at this Sevierville, Tenn., McDonald's before being diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in November 2017. He's now on his 11th dose of chemotherapy. After his 12th next month, he will return for a scan.&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; data-wide-src=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-selector&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;longform-inline-photo-caption&quot;&gt;Alan Chrisman worked as a maintenance employee at this Sevierville, Tenn., McDonald's before being diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in November 2017.

After his 12th next month, he will return for a scan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(Photo: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Weakened by chemotherapy and radiation, emaciated after shedding 40 pounds, and in extreme discomfort with tubes protruding from his backside, Chrisman occasionally can’t sit or stand. On a good day he can walk outside to pick up a single log for the fireplace in the couple’s unheated two-bedroom cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The Chrismans earned about $32,000 a year between his earnings and his wife’s $10 hourly wage cleaning laundry at a Smoky Mountain resort. The mounting medical bills and Chrisman’s lost wages devastated his wife, who tried to arrange payment plans with medical providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Chrisman applied for disability in November 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The rejection letter came six months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“Although your therapy is currently causing you discomfort, it is expected these effects will be temporary,” said the denial letter, based on the recommendation from Thrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Joyce Chrisman cried when she read the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes unlikely to be caught&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The disability process has two layers of oversight designed to catch errors, but doctors know there is little likelihood anyone would catch a mistake in denying someone's application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;First, a quality assurance department in Nashville spot-checks approvals and denials to make sure staff and doctors have followed procedures. Then, federal regional offices review a portion of disability applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Tennessee has consistently ranked high in the quality of its case reviews, averaging a 95.8 percent quality rating since 2016, said Arnold, the state spokesman. In 2017 DDS earned a Social Security Administration &quot;Phoenix Award&quot; for its performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;But the state and federal offices review a tiny percentage of denied disability claims for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;By law, half of all approvals by state DDS personnel are reviewed by Social Security Administration staff — a provision meant to safeguard public funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;module-position-ReEoFXDEXvU&quot; class=&quot;story-asset image-asset&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; class=&quot;wide single-photo&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;url&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/08/31/PNAS/a32064b4-ea17-4526-950a-aaff0a573555-NAS-DisabilityDenials_0004.JPG?width=2352&amp;amp;height=1764&amp;amp;fit=bounds&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; alt=&quot;Alan Chrisman was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer over a year ago. He applied for disability but was denied based on a recommendation by a medical contractor hired by the state to review claims. He then found a lawyer to file a request for reconsideration. Another physician&amp;#xA0;examined his file and recommended he be granted disability.&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; data-wide-src=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-selector&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;longform-inline-photo-caption&quot;&gt;Alan Chrisman was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer over a year ago.

Another physician examined his file and recommended he be granted disability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(Photo: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The law, however, doesn’t set specific requirements for denials. As a result, the Social Security Administration reviewed fewer than 2 percent of all rejections, according to an analysis by the National Association of Social Security Claims Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“If the adjudicator is making poor decisions, if they tend towards denials, they’re just not going to be reviewed,” said Jen Burdick, an attorney with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. She is is among advocates nationwide asking for Social Security to review more denials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Wrongful denials may be appealed, but &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/01/06/denied-disability-how-appeal-tennessee/2339794002/&quot;&gt;long delays for a hearing can take a devastating  toll&lt;/a&gt; in lost wages, lack of access to health care and medical bills. In fiscal year 2017, at least 9,570 people died waiting for their disability appeals to be heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed pays — sometimes millions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The Social Security Administration oversees two disability programs: Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, for low-income individuals without a work history, and Social Security Disability Insurance for workers who become disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The federal government delegates to the states the administration of the programs. Tennessee received $8.5 million last year from the Social Security Administration to hire medical consultants with a variety of specialties to review medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;These doctors never examine claimants in person, although they occasionally order a physical exam by another doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Seven days a week, setting their own schedules, the doctors swipe their badges to access secured floors of a brown and glass office building on the outskirts of downtown Nashville, logging into a computer system that generates a queue of cases to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Some applications contain just a few pages. Others include hundreds of pages of doctor’s notes, hospital reports, X-rays, lab results and employment records. Doctors must write a brief report to justify their findings, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The decision to grant or deny benefits is officially made by a state employee, but doctors who work for the state say it is their recommendation that carries the most weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;For this work, the doctors are paid a flat fee ranging from $30 to $47 per case. Doctors also bill $68 per hour in most instances for the time they spend consulting with staff or mentoring other physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the database below to search for physicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Like Thrush, some of these doctors work very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Dr. Kanika Chaudhuri, a pediatrician, evaluated 3,872 cases last fiscal year, averaging more than four cases per hour when she worked. She earned $192,000 in fiscal 2018 and $1.1 million since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Out of all the cases Chaudhuri reviewed over the five years, 78 percent were denied, according to data provided by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;State officials later noted that the denial data included cases in which multiple doctors made assessments, meaning Chaudhuri and other doctors may not have made the final assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Asked whether she felt pressured to review cases too quickly, Chaudhuri said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;No direct pressure. They recommend that we must keep up. They always recommend you do your best. There are so many applications and so few doctors. We are overwhelmed with cases.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Jenaan Khaleeli, a psychologist, has averaged 4½ cases an hour since 2013. Nearly 80 percent of those cases were denied. Over the five years, Khaleeli earned $1.2 million, including $209,000 in fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Dr. Frank Pennington, an ear, nose and throat specialist who is also a felon, earned $144,000 reviewing cases in fiscal 2018, and more than $1 million since 2013. During the five-year period he reviewed 20,835 cases, at a rate of three per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Pennington is one of five contract physicians with a history of misconduct. Pennington is confined to the administrative practice of medicine after three separate felony cocaine convictions and two stints in federal prison in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thrush had his license placed on probation for four years in 2008 after he  pleaded guilty to prescription fraud in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Arnold, the DHS spokesman, said the physicians were all doctors in good standing while employed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;It's important to remember these are not forward-facing doctors,&quot; Arnold said. &quot;Their role is to examine medical records and reports. They do not meet with patients in person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thrush, Pennington and Khaleeli did not respond to messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'A flawed system'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Tennessee’s pay-by-the-case model — and the sums paid to contract doctors — surprised even advocates and attorneys who routinely assist people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“There is an obvious financial incentive under such a payment arrangement — to process cases as quickly as possible,” said Russ Overby, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee, who represents individuals seeking disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“I am concerned that some clients who are in fact eligible for disability benefits will be denied because there has not been a sufficient review of the case.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Carrie Hobbs Guiden, executive director of The Arc of Tennessee, advocates for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities who occasionally apply for Social Security disability benefits. Doctors have to invest the time to properly review cases, she said, especially when it involves people with untreated mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“If they’re getting paid based on how many they get done, that’s a flawed system,” Guiden said. “That’s not encouraging quality. You have to question if the purpose is to deny as many people as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under pressure to meet 'workload goals'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;State disability determination departments face enormous pressures to meet &quot;workload goals&quot; set by the Social Security Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In 2018, the Social Security Administration set a goal of 103,161 disability applications to be cleared by Tennessee's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The staff and consultants needed to clear those cases in Tennessee have shrunk by 24 percent between 2010 and 2016.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Failure to meet goals can result in a financial penalty from the federal government, according to Jeffrey Price, the past legislative director for the National Association of Disability Examiners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctors elsewhere push back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;About half of all state disability offices in the United States operate on a similar model to Tennessee’s, in which physicians reviewing applications are paid by the case, according to Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The contract model, in which doctors receive a fee for each assessment, introduces some risks, Price said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“If you were paid by the case, it behooves you to sign off on as many cases as you can,” he said. “I think that model at least has the potential for increased error rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“A doctor can review cases effectively at about two cases per hour,” Price said. “You’re hoping that the doctor will actually look at the whole case, not just what the examiner wrote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Doctors like Thrush, who processed more than five cases per hour, might be valued in an office trying to shovel itself out of a large caseload, Price said, but the pace is implausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“I think that would be dangerous, actually,” Price said. “Inherently you would be missing something if you’re looking at five cases an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;At the North Carolina Disability Determination Services office, where Price has worked for nearly 40 years, managers recently asked doctors to process an average of three cases per hour instead of two. Doctors in that office are all on staff, as opposed to contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“Some of our doctors are pushing back,” Price said. “They say that’s too many.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A rule put into place by the Social Security Administration in 2017 has made the work of DDS physicians even more critical in deciding an outcome of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Previously a “treating physician rule” required DDS to give more weight to the opinions of an applicant’s personal doctor than doctors hired by DDS. That rule was eliminated, giving doctors hired by DDS more influence in deciding the outcome of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;presto-h2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Something needs to be done'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;After Chrisman was denied, he and his wife found a lawyer in Sevierville tofile a request for reconsideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In September, Joyce Chrisman came home from work and brought the mail inside their cabin. The letter from Social Security said, “We found that you became disabled under our rules on November 8, 2017.” That was the day after she urged Chrisman to visit the walk-in clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Another physician had examined Alan Chrisman's file and recommended he be granted disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“We said ‘wow,' ” Chrisman said. “We couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;George Garrison, his lawyer, said he was troubled by The Tennessean's findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“People come to me at a point they’re about to lose everything they’ve got,” he said. “They’re sick. They’re dying. They’re having to deal with a complex system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The benefit meant that Joyce Chrisman no longer had to worry about paying medical bills. The bills would be paid dating back to the time her husband applied for disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;His disability approval also automatically qualified Alan Chrisman for TennCare, which is now covering his ongoing chemotherapy, medications and hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Chrisman sits on his couch most of the time. He’s on his 11th dose of chemotherapy. After his 12th next month, he will return for a scan. “Then we’ll go from there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thinking about the months he spent rejected — when he and his wife were barely scraping by — Chrisman gets angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“Something needs to be done,” he said. “They’re either getting too much of a caseload or they’re getting greedy.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Denied: How some Tennessee doctors earn big money denying disability claims</og:title>
<og:description>Tennessee doctors are paid to review applications to the federal disability program. How much they earn depends on how fast they work. Some doctors work very fast.</og:description>
