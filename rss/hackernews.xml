In the shadow of a rising Combine fortress known as the Citadel, residents of City 17 learn to live under the rule of their invaders. But among this scattered population are two of Earth's most resourceful scientists: Dr. Eli Vance and his daughter Alyx, the founders of a fledgling resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pedestrian walks by a WeWork office on October 07, 2019 in San Francisco, California. Days after withdrawing its registration for an initial public offering, WeWork also warned employees that the company could be set to lay off nearly 2,000 people, about 16 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;56.813281586891&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WeWork is laying off 2,400 employees as it works to cut costs and right-size the business, the company confirmed to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a WeWork spokesperson said the cuts were being made as part of the company's efforts to &quot;create a more efficient organization&quot; and refocus on the core office-sharing business. The job reductions represent 19% of WeWork's total workforce, which amounted to 12,500 employees as of June 30, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519244329/d804478ds1a.htm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;an SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The process began weeks ago in regions around the world and continued this week in the U.S.,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;This workforce reduction affects approximately 2,400 employees globally, who will receive severance, continued benefits, and other forms of assistance to aid in their career transition. These are incredibly talented professionals and we are grateful for the important roles they have played in building WeWork over the last decade.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the announcement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/wework-reportedly-expected-to-lay-off-2000-workers-as-soon-as-this-week.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of forthcoming job cuts had been circulating for weeks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported on Sunday that WeWork could cut at least 4,000 jobs across its core office-sharing business and some side ventures. In October, Marcelo Claure, WeWork's new executive chairman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/weworks-new-chairman-claure-says-layoffs-are-coming-in-internal-memo.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that layoffs would be on the way but didn't say how many would be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claure said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/wework-planning-to-layoff-thousands-in-cost-cutting-efforts.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;memo to employees earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the company will hold an all-hands meeting at 10 a.m. ET on Friday to address the changes slated for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs come after several tumultuous months for WeWork. In September, the beleaguered start-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/wework-says-it-will-file-request-to-withdraw-its-ipo-prospectus-after-roadshow-management-turmoil.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;pulled its IPO filing&lt;/a&gt; after investors balked at its mounting losses and unusual corporate governance structure. The scrutiny forced WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/wework-ceo-adam-neumann-is-expected-to-step-down-amid-controversy-and-retain-chair-role-wsj-reports.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;to step down&lt;/a&gt; from his role as CEO, with Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson stepping in as co-CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WeWork was poised to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/without-deal-wework-would-have-been-out-of-money-next-friday-sources-say.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;run out of money&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of weeks, but secured an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/softbank-to-take-control-of-wework.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;11th-hour bailout deal&lt;/a&gt; from SoftBank, its biggest investor. With a new owner in place, WeWork is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/wework-says-it-will-divest-all-non-core-businesses.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;make sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to its business, including divesting noncore businesses and focusing on enterprise customers, instead of small and mid-sized clients. However, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/wework-q3-2019-earnings-lost-1point25-billion-on-934-million-in-revenue.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;continues to bleed cash&lt;/a&gt;, reporting $1.25 billion in losses for the third quarter, widening sharply from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>1000fps image projection on deforming non-rigid surface</title>
<link>http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vision/DPM/</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;feature&quot; readability=&quot;33.529392868615&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dynamic projection mapping onto deforming non-rigid surface using a high-speed projector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projection mapping attracts attentions as an emerging technology to extend the real world. However, almost realized examples have been limited to static or quasi-static environments. This research aims at overcoming this limitation and realizes dynamic projection mapping in which dynamically-changing real-world and virtual visual information are completely merged in the level of human visual perception. This high-speed dynamic projection mapping requires a high-speed projector enabling high-frame-rate and low-latency projection. In order to meet this demand, we have developed a high-speed projector &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vision/dynaflash/index-j.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;DynaFlash&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can project 8-bit images up to 1,000fps with 3ms delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, as a challenging target for the dynamic projection mapping, we focus on a non-rigid surface. Sensing of non-rigid surface deformation is difficult to be achieved at high speed because it has high degrees-of-freedom and involves self-occlusions as well as external occlusions. Our newly proposed method overcomes this limitation. Our method can obtain the deformation robustly at 1,000 fps by using an originally proposed marker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vision/DDCM/index-e.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;Deformable Dot Cluster Marker&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even when the target causes large deformation and occlusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these base technologies including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vision/dynaflash/index-e.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DynaFlash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vision/DDCM/index-e.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deformable Dot Cluster Marker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we realize a new dynamic projection mapping onto deforming non-rigid surface. In this demonstration, by drawing the marker on the target with IR ink, we allow the marker to be invisible to human and enable robust sensing independently of the projected images. In our technology, both the projection and sensing are operated at a speed of 1,000 fps. Therefore, it is possible to keep the projection consistent with the deformation and extend the real world as if the projected image is printed or existed as an original (digital) texture on the target. Especially, focusing on new paradigms in the field of user interface and fashion, we have demonstrated dynamic projection mapping onto a deformed sheet of paper and T-shirt. Also we show that projection to multiple targets can be controlled flexibly by using multiple markers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft&amp;#039;s “Love” of Linux</title>
<link>http://pedrocr.pt/text/microsofts-love-of-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://pedrocr.pt/text/microsofts-love-of-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Microsoft has been making a lot of announcements and releases of technology that fall under a supposedly &lt;em&gt;“Microsoft Loves Linux”&lt;/em&gt; type of strategy. This is particularly noteworthy given the history of Microsoft since the end of the 90s. Their internal policy was a full attack on Linux&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref1&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. and they were convicted by a US court of anti-trust violations for acting out that strategy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref2&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If they have indeed now fully turned around and now “love” Linux that would indeed be big news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two particular strategies became famous in how Microsoft treated Linux (and also other technologies and competitors):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)&lt;/strong&gt;: a marketing strategy designed to discredit the technology and it’s proponents by spreading that open-source software infringes on Microsoft patents and is costlier to operate among other claims&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref3&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish (EEE)&lt;/strong&gt;: a technical and market strategy of starting by becoming compatible with an upcoming technology only to extend its monopoly by creating incompatible extensions and using them to push out the original competitors&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref4&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news yesterday was about the release of exFAT patents so the filesystem is usable in the Linux kernel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref5&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is a case where Microsoft has been able to extract billions out of companies shipping Android by asserting exFAT patents, so it’s right in line with the FUD strategy. But for the sake of this discussion lets assume Microsoft’s strategy isn’t to talk out of both sides of its mouth and that the “Microsoft Loves Linux” slogan is genuine from a marketing standpoint. That of course means that the FUD attack is now off the Microsoft playbook. How about EEE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the announcements we’ve seen so far out of the “new” Microsoft post-Ballmer are still fully consistent with the EEE strategy as far as I can tell. I can practically see the slide out of the strategy deck that describes it. I won’t spin up PowerPoint and produce it for fear of it showing up somewhere presented as a real Microsoft slide. But I’ll give you all the data you need to visualize it (or produce it yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide Title: &lt;strong&gt;Cement Microsoft’s technological and market positions with a “Love Linux” strategy that exploits the best out of the technology without giving away strategic advantages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left side of the slide body: &lt;strong&gt;Capture technological advantages and engage with the tech community…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augment Windows&lt;/strong&gt; userland stack with &lt;strong&gt;best-of-breed technologies&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., Cygwin done right/built-in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release foundational technologies as open-source&lt;/strong&gt; in cases where the Microsoft stack is being left behind (e.g., position .NET as a neutral technology)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port server applications&lt;/strong&gt; in cases where Windows Server is not a competitive solution (e.g., release SQL Server for Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right side of the slide body: &lt;strong&gt;…while maintaining key assets in place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain &lt;strong&gt;Office as a Windows-first&lt;/strong&gt; experience (i.e., keep the Office365 use cases narrow, complementary and reactive to competitors like Google Sheets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend and &lt;strong&gt;aggressively expand APIs and technologies&lt;/strong&gt; where Microsoft leads (e.g., keep DirectX the only first-class API for games)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to &lt;strong&gt;push Windows Server&lt;/strong&gt; and supporting cloud offerings as the &lt;strong&gt;only viable technology for corporate productivity&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., reinforce the proprietary Outlook/ActiveSync/ActiveDirectory/etc stack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keen eyed will see that the recent “Love Linux” themed announcements fit this strategy (WSL, .NET Core, SQL Server on Linux) as well as the non-announcements (no Office on Linux, DirectX instead of Vulkan, etc). But the strategy doesn’t fit because I’m biased and am out to do a hit job. I think this is a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; strategy for Microsoft and exactly what it should do given the position it has in the market and technology landscape we are in. Their traditional technological moats are mostly gone and they are playing their strategic cards just right to maintain the market moats while also gaining a veneer of “we’re hip and cool and with the times on open-source”. But it’s just a veneer, don’t patronize everyone by claiming you “Love Linux” when the available evidence all points to this just being another chapter in Microsoft’s anti-Linux strategy. A strategy that they obviously should have because Linux has been an existential threat to their business for over 20 years and that threat has nothing but increased over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, this is a theory, and as any good theory needs to be falsifiable. So here are the kinds of news that would require re-evaluating it because they would definitely signal some kind of “love” for Linux:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft launches Office for desktop Linux or otherwise makes the Linux Office experience go from fourth-rate&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref6&quot;&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to first-rate (e.g., by making Office a web-only product accessible from any standards-compliant browser).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DirectX, Win32 and other Windows-only APIs are dropped. New apps opt-in to a brave new world of .NET/Vulkan/etc that can be equally run on Linux and old apps run in backwards compatibility mode like DOS apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active Directory and associated technologies are released as 1) a set of closed source containers or VMs to be launched in the Linux cloud of your choice and 2) a fully featured open-source client stack that plugs into standard Linux technologies allowing corporate admins to manage Windows and Linux clients with the same tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think all of these would be strategic blunders from the point of view of Microsoft shareholders. But they’re the kind of things you do for love. Otherwise this is just “love” if your standard is abusive one-sided relationships. My suggestion is to keep the strategy and drop the slogan. Or don’t if your marketing research says people are buying it. After all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groucho Marx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Satya Nadella Added $850B to Microsoft</title>
<link>https://www.afr.com/technology/how-satya-nadella-added-850b-to-microsoft-20191114-p53ajl</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.afr.com/technology/how-satya-nadella-added-850b-to-microsoft-20191114-p53ajl</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In many ways the JEDI contract, which runs for 10 years, is the ultimate rolled gold stamp of approval for Nadella's decision to shift Microsoft's strategic direction towards hyper-scale cloud computing, under the banner of Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that he needed confirmation of his brilliance. Since he took over as chief executive in February 2014, Microsoft's stock price has risen fourfold, adding about $US850 billion in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_310ts&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_2cV_j&quot;&gt;Nadella prioritised the Azure cloud business before he became CEO. When he took over, he set out to change the Microsoft culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Nadella's move into the cloud was a worry to a Microsoft board of directors used to thinking about the world as Bill Gates did, with a PC on every desk running proprietary software that was updated every three years. The company was used to earning profit margins of 90 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as revenues grew his vision was recognised. The growth in the volume of new business has compensated for the fall in margins to about 63 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella prioritised the Azure cloud business before he became CEO. When he took over from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, he set out to change the Microsoft culture. This multi-year task is well described in his 2017 book, &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embracing open-source code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend of software developers. Nadella pulled down the company's walled-garden approach to software development and embraced open-sourced coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;_1srKI&quot; src=&quot;https://www.afr.com/assets/b4682377.gif&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_620/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_382/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e, https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_764/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_42%2Cf_auto/7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e 2x&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 382px&quot; data-id=&quot;7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e&quot; data-pb-im-config=&quot;{&amp;quot;aspectRatio&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;raw&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:382,&amp;quot;urls&amp;quot;:[&amp;quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_382/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e&amp;quot;,&amp;quot; https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_764/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_42%2Cf_auto/7f32a73c643b9dd6afc0c3b96f047405ae691c6e 2x&amp;quot;]}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is the world's strongest supporter of the Linux open source coding system and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/technology/microsoft-sees-github-as-faster-path-into-cloud-ai-20180605-h10yo6&quot;&gt;its purchase of GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for $US7.6 billion in 2018 gave it access to 36 million open source software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella recognised early on that everything would become digital and all software applications could live either in the cloud or on servers controlled by customers on their premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three years ago Microsoft's software engineers broke everything in the company's suite of products into modular applications. Instead of offering customers monolithic systems that take years to embed and always cost more than expected, Nadella rebuilt everything on Azure so customers can pick and choose and mix and match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had the insight to recognise Microsoft's foundations as a provider of productivity tools for large enterprises through the Office product set could be the springboard for turning the company into the platform for digitisation of just about any task in any industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this digitisation of everything that makes Hamish Douglass, chairman and chief investment officer at Magellan Financial Group, believe that Microsoft is only at the very beginning of its cloud-driven expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think of the cloud as a platform,&quot; he says. &quot;When we move to the Internet of Things, businesses and government departments, are going to start digitising processes and moving those processes to the cloud and then start processing the data with machine learning and AI [artificial intelligence].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;I think they're building an entire platform for digitising the enterprise,&quot; he says. &quot;They are developing their own productivity software through Dynamics and Office, but also I think they want to be hosting other people's software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who knows what software's going to be written in the next 10 to 20 years? There's going to be the digitisation of health services, the taxation department, manufacturing processes and all the smart things through the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;I think because they're an enterprise company and they have all these components, they're so well positioned. The commercial cloud business is already growing at 30 per cent a year and they haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This business has come from nowhere 10 years ago to $US40 billion a year. We're talking about a market that's going to be in the trillions of dollars of addressable market.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magellan owns $3.1 billion in Microsoft shares as part of its global equities strategy. Douglass says he first bought the shares in 2013 when the stock was $US28 a share and the market thought &quot;Windows was dead&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella says every company is now a technology company and the next big technology breakthroughs will come &quot;not only from technology companies, but from retailers, healthcare providers and manufacturers, working in partnership with us&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s fantastic to see this in action in Australia, where we’re partnering with leaders in every industry and across the public sector to apply technology to address some of their biggest challenges – from improving healthcare outcomes and optimising employee training to empowering first line workers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon had a four year head start on Microsoft in cloud computing but Nadella came to the market with a bold growth target of creating a $US20 billion-a-year business by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stretch target was sold to Wall Street by chief financial officer Amy Hood, who has all the hallmarks of being the next CEO of Microsoft whenever Nadella chooses to depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has brought stringent discipline to Microsoft's business fundamentals and a laser-like focus on the entire expenses line. Most divisions have flat budgets and must get expansion capital from transformation benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon still dominates cloud computing with a market share of 48 per cent, according to Gartner. But Microsoft is rapidly catching up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the  year to June the Azure cloud business grew by 63 per cent and its market share rose to 15.5 per cent, while Amazon's share went backwards. Microsoft has more than doubled its market share since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;_1srKI&quot; src=&quot;https://www.afr.com/assets/b4682377.gif&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_620/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_382/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a, https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_764/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_42%2Cf_auto/913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a 2x&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 382px&quot; data-id=&quot;913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a&quot; data-pb-im-config=&quot;{&amp;quot;aspectRatio&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;raw&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:382,&amp;quot;urls&amp;quot;:[&amp;quot;https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_382/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a&amp;quot;,&amp;quot; https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_764/t_resize_width/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_42%2Cf_auto/913ccbc43430f2435df4451a3a5f4635e206586a 2x&amp;quot;]}&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's president Brad Smith, CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrowing gap in market share partly explains why Amazon is so angry about losing the JEDI contract. It has accused the US government of &quot;unmistakable bias&quot; and is readying a court challenge. It will be fascinating to see whether Bezos, the publisher of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, can prove President Donald Trump was involved in the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it no surprise cloud momentum is with the company with the JEDI contract, considering Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen built a pop culture museum in Microsoft's home town, Seattle. It is full of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; memorabilia, including Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JEDI contract is significant from multiple perspectives,  according to Microsoft president Brad Smith. During an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt; in his office at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, he hints it will have ramifications for US military allies such as Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think if this contract were awarded in 2016, or maybe even 2017, it more likely would have gone in another direction because Azure was not as full-featured as it is today,&quot; he says. &quot;And so it just reflects the incredible investment we made in innovation, especially with an eye towards meeting the needs of large customers like the Department of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it is a reflection, second, of the degree to which the world is embracing the cloud. In part, the clear philosophy of the Pentagon is they need to move faster to get to the cloud, because that's where the future is, and they can't expect to be the leading military force in the world if they're not using the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that is a lesson that speaks not only to the military forces of the world, but fundamentally to every type of institution in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And so, yes, I think that we may well see this speak to people in other industries, or areas of government, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Third, you know, every contract is important, but some contracts are more important than others, and you know this award is not just a contract, it's a responsibility, you know, and it creates for Microsoft a very important responsibility for the defence of the United States, and fundamentally the protection of the American people,&quot; Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_310ts&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_2cV_j&quot;&gt;This contract is going to have multiple ramifications over many years for the role that we need to play in many parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_81MY6&quot;&gt;— Brad Smith, Microsoft president&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And, yes, I think the single most important thing that we do, as a company, is act with the acute appreciation of the responsibility that creates for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we do that, you know, I think that it is an opportunity, almost by definition, to connect with the other governments and military forces that are close allies to the United States. I think that, again, that takes us to the other four of the Five Eyes, and to the 26 other NATO members, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And so I think this is a contract that's going to have multiple ramifications over many years, for the role that we need to play in many parts of the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to the brilliance of Nadella's strategic shift to the cloud, not the least of which was his decision to use Microsoft as a test bed for a corporate transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, how can you possibly convince your customers of the merits of tech transformation tools if you have not used them yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's chief digital officer and executive vice-president corporate strategy and operations, Kurt DelBene, says Nadella recognised early on that the old way of running IT was broken and would not enable companies to transform themselves at the pace required in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two and a half years ago, Satya was really saying, 'We're seeing all this transformation that happens in our customer base or that they want to know what transformation needs.' They have an inkling that the way they do IT today is not going to survive,&quot; DelBene says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's just the wrong way to think about it. Essentially, speccing out a system that you need, based on your people inside the organisation, saying, 'I need you to deliver these features.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And you then go to somebody like Accenture, and say, 'Deliver me these features', and then they run it, and with no real insight as to what the business processes are and how those are going to change over a period of time, or need to change over a period of time to get where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And so, I think what's put a head on that is this recognition by all industries that digitisation - or this tech intensity, as Satya talked about it - this need to have technology, software, services be a core part of your business, moving forward, is exploding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella gave DelBene the task of transforming Microsoft's approach to managing IT. He knew the job was in good hands because DelBene had just spent seven months fixing healthcare.gov for president Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were two-thirds outsourced, so we did the thing that everybody did of listening to constituents and then just parrot it back and say, 'Build us this',&quot; DelBene says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We did not have a deep technical bench, in terms of people being able to really envision what the software can do, and then actually code it. We basically ran the systems that we specced and had delivered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene says Microsoft's transformation resulted in huge costs savings from in-sourcing software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're about two-thirds in-sourced now,&quot; he says. &quot;We've massively reduced our outsourcing dependency, as a result, in hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have moved 95 per cent of our systems to the cloud. We have a vision for every single one of our product areas in concert with the stakeholders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During its transformation, Microsoft moved to what DelBene calls a &quot;DevOps&quot; model, which means the developers who wrote the code also operate the system they wrote the code for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft has married the perpetual software licensing approach in Microsoft's Office 365 products with the perpetual licensing that comes with cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene says Nadella's &quot;superpower&quot; is in &quot;envisioning where the industry's going, envisioning products, stitching together different patterns into new products&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella sees patterns in the way customers are using products and responds by directing software development resources to these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business is broken down into three segments: productivity and business processes, which includes Office 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365; intelligent cloud, which includes server products and cloud services; and more personal computing, which includes Windows, Bing, Xbox and Surface computer devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft grows more powerful and its services and products become more pervasive across business and government, it is bound to catch the attention of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already happening, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/956ccaa6-0537-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca&quot;&gt;warning of potential &quot;sovereignty&quot; issues&lt;/a&gt; from the storage of data on Microsoft servers even though they are located in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported last week that Merkel told a union conference:  “So many companies have just outsourced all their data to US companies. I’m not saying that’s bad in and of itself — I just mean that the value-added products that come out of that, with the help of artificial intelligence, will create dependencies that I’m not sure are a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that whatever concerns Merkel has will be addressed in fulsome detail by Smith, who is sometimes referred to as the US secretary of state for tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It his consummate management of regulatory issues that is largely responsible for Microsoft avoiding the intense political scrutiny and public opprobrium directed at Facebook, Google and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_310ts&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_2cV_j&quot;&gt;I think Microsoft is a company that understands responsibility because they have been a broad business enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_81MY6&quot;&gt;— Rod Sims, ACCC chairman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, says Microsoft was not like the new digital platform companies such as Facebook and Google, which he says have never taken responsibility for what happens on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook and Google say, 'we are just a platform, just like Airbnb',  whereas the larger tech companies like Microsoft have never had that approach,&quot; he says. &quot;They are a company doing business in a way companies do. They take a broader approach. They can see they have got to get ahead of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think Microsoft is a company that understands responsibility because they have been a broad business enterprise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who is also Microsoft's chief legal officer, has taken a proactive stance across all the big tech debates including privacy, the digital divide and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company once labelled &quot;the Evil Empire&quot; and at the forefront of attempts by anti-trust regulators in the US to be broken apart 20 years ago is largely missing from US congressional committee meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith made sure Microsoft leads from the front on just about every contentious regulatory issue. For example, Microsoft voluntarily adopted Europe's General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules across all its products worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Smith who made sure Microsoft sent a senior executive from head office to Australia when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a meeting of technology executives earlier this year in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Google sent local representatives who could not speak on behalf of head office and were therefore berated by Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith wrote a book with Carol Ann Browne called &lt;em&gt;Tools and Weapons&lt;/em&gt;. It is the blueprint for showing technology companies how to take responsibility for the technology they create and assist governments left behind by the pace of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will come in handy if Elizabeth Warren is elected president in next year's US election. She says technology companies have too much power, engage in anti-competitive behaviour and must be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does exercise its market power. From October 1, newly purchased Microsoft SQL Server and Windows Server licensees cannot be migrated to dedicated or single servers in the cloud offerings of Amazon and Google without paying additional fees. The licence fees are substantially less if the customer migrates to Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transformative role in Australia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, Nadella will meet selected clients in business and government, as well as be the special guest at a Chanticleer lunch in Sydney on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For nearly four decades, we’ve partnered closely with leading organisations of every size in every industry in Australia to help them innovate,&quot; he says ahead of his arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;adWrapper _3XglG _2q7By GYyNR _1wVyG&quot;&gt;



&lt;small class=&quot;_3azTn&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, more than two million Australian organisations use our platforms and tools, and we are investing significantly in our local engineering presence, as well as our data-centre footprint in the country, so customers can build the digital capability increasingly required to compete and grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Microsoft’s largest customers and partners is Telstra. It is an Azure customer, the biggest reseller of Microsoft 365, and it will be the exclusive Australian partner for the launch of the new Xbox All Access gaming package, a gaming subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telstra chief executive Andy Penn says Telstra is using a Microsoft product called Teams to collaborate and work in an agile way as part of its transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Much of what we're trying to achieve from a transformation point of view and moving to agile is what we see our customers wanting to do as well,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn says Telstra needs to be much more closely aligned with companies like Microsoft and their way of working and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need bring together the capabilities of telecommunications and software and that's why we have worked really closely with partnerships and relationships with people like Microsoft,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer says Microsoft has helped boost collaboration at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the things I find really interesting at the moment is if you combine what the tools can do for normal working people in office environments with new structures of how you manage people, it's really quite profoundly changing what goes on in a big company and the way a big company goes about doing its work,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech bubble heyday of Microsoft, the company was often accused of being arrogant. That is unlikely to happen this time judging from Smith's  comments about the possible lessons from winning the JEDI contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never assume that you're in the leadership position in technology because the leadership position can change quickly,&quot; he says. &quot;Never conclude that you're so far behind that you can't catch up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica receiving Amazon packages, Nov. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;98.007207771858&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica — not her real name&lt;/strong&gt; — has spent well over $15,000 on Amazon this year, buying everything from Halloween decorations to a queen-size inflatable mattress. She's purchased over 700 products, including three vacuum cleaners, six desk chairs, and no fewer than 26 pairs of earbuds. And even though most of the products are cheaply made, she’s given each a 5-star review. The twentysomething who lives on the East Coast isn’t a bad judge of quality — the companies that sell these products on Amazon reimburse her for the purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the loot may be free to her, Jessica’s habit does come with a cost — if you’ve considered buying an Instant Pot recently, her 5-star review, complete with photos and a video, might have nudged you toward a knockoff instead of the real thing. It’s entirely fake, but Jessica told BuzzFeed News she doesn’t think she’s gaming the system; she’s trying to help brands grow their businesses in Amazon’s massive marketplace. “I’m just a pawn in their marketing scheme,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party sellers know what it takes to make it on Amazon: Get good reviews and a high search ranking. But attracting genuine customers is tough, so some sellers use a reliable cheat — bribes. Because of Amazon’s vast scale, inscrutable algorithms, and capricious enforcement of its own rules, unscrupulous sellers and paid shills largely get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has banned giving away free products in exchange for reviews, so Jessica requested anonymity out of fear that the company would suspend her account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers reach out to Jessica through targeted Facebook ads touting free items or dedicated review groups with thousands of members, and give her a specific set of instructions to purchase their products on Amazon. After she leaves a 5-star review, the sellers reimburse her via PayPal or an Amazon gift card, and let her keep the items she reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica’s activity, as far as Amazon is concerned, looks legitimate. She makes purchases from her own Amazon account and credit card, so her reviews are labeled as a “verified purchase.” After the sellers confirm Jessica has left a 5-star review, the payment is made out of Amazon’s view. The credit card, an Amazon-branded rewards card, gives Jessica an extra bonus for the purchase. In other words, third-party sellers aren’t the only ones paying her to leave fake reviews and superficially boost sales — Amazon is too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News sent Amazon a detailed list of questions about how it polices inauthentic reviews. A company spokesperson responded with the same statement it provided for our Oct. 14 report on Amazon sellers &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-sellers-facebook-chatbots-fake-reviews&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;using Facebook chatbots to cheat&lt;/a&gt; its review system. The statement noted that the site had prevented more than 13 million attempts to post inauthentic reviews, and that it &quot;took action&quot; against more than 5 million sellers' accounts for review manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But consultants who work with Amazon’s third-party sellers say that the bad actors continue to exploit blind spots in the system, and do so without virtually any consequences. Meanwhile, Jessica, and many reviewers like her, benefit from the sellers’ willingness to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-image xs-mb4 xs-relative subbuzz-image--outset-both&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-image&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;Bryan Anselm for BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;89&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A table in&lt;/strong&gt; the back corner of the dining room of Jessica’s two-family home is buried under a mountain of clutter — a faux leather purse, a vacuum, a salad spinner, a foot spa, and kids’ toys. Bits of miscellany are haphazardly sorted in big plastic bins underneath the rummage. The items on top are Amazon products Jessica hasn’t reviewed yet. The items below the table have already been refunded and are up for grabs by family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every day, Jessica’s boyfriend of eight years begrudgingly hauls Amazon packages in from the porch. “He hates it,” she told BuzzFeed News. But Jessica proudly points to all the items she's acquired for their new house: “I got our new showerhead, shower organizer, side tables, coat rack, coat hangers. … We would have had to pay for all that stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her boyfriend brings them in, Jessica opens the boxes, removes products from their packaging, assembles them, and takes photographs. Later, she’ll write reviews while she and her boyfriend watch TV. Jessica told BuzzFeed News she tries to be thoughtful about what she writes (although never mentions outright that a product is bad) — but no matter what she says, each review receives the same rating: 5 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot to keep track of. Jessica is constantly brokering deals with sellers (and, occasionally, hounding them for payment) through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. Many sellers tell her the exact keywords to search for on Amazon to more closely simulate an actual Amazon purchase. The method — searching for a keyword and adding the item to a shopping cart — also elevates the product’s profile in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers instruct Jessica not to review products for at least five to six days after receiving the item to make the review appear more authentic. She meticulously records into an Excel spreadsheet each product, its target review date, the item’s delivery date, whether she’s taken a photo or submitted a review, what she paid, the reimbursement paid by the seller, and the amount she lost or made in the transaction, among other pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet helps Jessica make sure she’s on top of due dates and getting paid on time. BuzzFeed News reviewed the document, which showed 117 open orders that hadn’t been refunded yet. A column titled “Total currently out of pocket” — or what she’s still owed — amounted to $2,282.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz__section-divider subbuzz__section-divider--thin xs-block xs-mb4 xs-col-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;79.997286295794&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Amazon, third-party sellers look for any advantage they can get and, by enlisting customers like Jessica, they can generate seemingly authentic sales and reviews — fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the products on Amazon aren’t sold by Amazon itself. Millions of independent third-party sellers use the platform to distribute their wares. Look on any product page and somewhere below the price you’ll likely see: “Sold by [Store Name] and Fulfilled by Amazon.” These merchandisers get access to Amazon’s customers. In turn, the company gets a cut of their sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon reported that in 2018, customers spent $160 billion on items from third-party sellers — 58% of all sales on the site. More than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/one-million-new-sellers-on-amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 million sellers&lt;/a&gt; joined Amazon marketplaces around the world that year, according to e-commerce data firm Marketplace Pulse. In this year’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://ir.aboutamazon.com/node/33066/html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shareholder letter&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wrote: “Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thousands of new sellers signing up every day, there is a lot of competition — much of which comes from China. A &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-heavy-recruitment-of-chinese-sellers-puts-consumers-at-risk-11573489075&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; story found that in 2018, a new product from China was uploaded every 1/50th of a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why some third-party sellers are willing to give away products for free. Their hope is that, in doing so, they’ll gain a competitive edge that’ll attract more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Jessica does helps sellers in two ways. First, it bolsters their reviews, which convince customers to buy. It also inflates another consequential Amazon metric: an item’s sales rank, which represents a product’s number of sales compared to similar listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme — according to Ryan Flannagan, the CEO of Nuanced Media, a consultancy firm for independent sellers on Amazon — is designed to dupe the site’s algorithm by creating the illusion that a product flying off the shelves. “As people purchase more, the listing becomes more visible to customers [in a search]. Sales velocity gives the product that flywheel effect,” Flannagan explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said, “Customer reviews do not have a consequential impact on search ranking,” adding that availability and the frequency of sales are also factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cheapest, easiest way to make money is to cheat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;58&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that may be true, reviews have a huge impact on sales, which &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; affect search ranking, according to John LeBaron, chief revenue officer of Pattern, an e-commerce consulting firm. A study by the firm found that a 1-star increase in a product’s average rating led to a 26% jump in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBaron said that a high ranking in a search can be worth tens of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue. A Pattern analysis found that for the search term “men’s sunglasses,” the top five vendors each rake in $60,000 per month on average; the top 10 sellers earn $53,000, and products on the first page make $42,000. “That’s what makes spending money on free products worth it for these blackhat sellers,” LeBaron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracting genuine customers to a listing is expensive and doesn’t guarantee good reviews. “The cheapest, easiest way to [make money] is to cheat. Unless Amazon takes an aggressive approach, it’s going to continue to flourish,” said LeBaron. “It’s really detrimental to people playing by the rules.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica doesn’t have&lt;/strong&gt; many vices. She doesn’t drink or smoke. In her spare time, she goes out to trivia nights, watches movies with friends, and reads. Her childhood best friend, Christina, described her as “very outgoing” and “sweet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her review habit started with a Facebook ad, a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-sellers-facebook-chatbots-fake-reviews?bfsource=relatedmanual&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;common marketing method for sellers’ fake review programs&lt;/a&gt;, she said. The ad, which was for free measuring spoons, included a link that opened Facebook Messenger. She clicked and started chatting with the seller. After she received the spoons and wrote a review, the seller promptly sent her a PayPal refund. She was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After that, the ads for free stuff just multiplied tenfold,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers started inviting Jessica to private Facebook groups with names like “Secret Rebate Club” and “AMZ Freebies.” One of the groups has nearly 30,000 members. She now participates in dozens of groups. From other members, who are reviewers themselves, Jessica learned about websites like Hundsonvine and a more selective, referral-only program called Fullyrebate, both of which she now participates in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like getting stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica said the majority of sellers she messages with are Chinese. They respond to messages only between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Eastern time, which are working hours — 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. — on Beijing time. During Golden Week, a Chinese holiday, the administrators of multiple Facebook pages noted that refunds would not be issued and representatives would not be available to respond to inquiries while they observe the national days of rest. Facebook is technically blocked in China, so sellers access the site using a virtual private network. Occasionally, sellers will go dark for a few days because of issues with their VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reviewing the measuring spoon set, Jessica has written about hundreds of products. “I like getting stuff. It’s like Christmas every day here,” she explained. Jessica’s upstairs neighbor recently complimented her new cat water fountain. She responded, “No problem, I’ll get you one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica gives away many of the items she reviews, and she has made about $150 by selling products on Facebook Marketplace. She’s donated clothes that don’t fit and handed off the rest to family members or friends. “I like being able to give my friends things without breaking the bank,” she said. The reviewing allows her to regularly treat the people in her life; she hasn’t had to buy a birthday gift all year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz__section-divider subbuzz__section-divider--thin xs-block xs-mb4 xs-col-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;138&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an Amazon Prime&lt;/strong&gt; member with an Amazon Chase credit card, Jessica is, ironically, rewarded for exploiting the company’s blind spots. She’s made hundreds of dollars through the Amazon card’s cashback benefit as a result of the purchases, which come at nearly no cost to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She receives about $100 in cash rewards every month. She could make more — but some items for review are purchased with Amazon gift cards, which don’t count toward rewards. Jessica plows that money right back into Amazon for her own purchases, typically Kindle books and, most recently, an Instant Pot pressure cooker (not the off-brand version she got for free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really don’t think I’m making money on it at all. I’m pretty sure I’m losing money,” Jessica said while looking over her spreadsheet. “I’m pretty sure I’m at a 10% loss. But I’m okay with it, because I’ve gotten a whole bunch of new stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica has rated almost every item she has been commissioned 5 stars, except for one, a crossbody purse that shipped with a broken magnet. She rated the purse 3 stars and received a $20 refund from the seller anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jessica is conflicted. On the one hand, she sees the Chinese sellers as small business owners who are doing what they have to do to make it on the platform. In chats reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the sellers use language like “This will help our small business out a lot!” and “We’re a small family business selling on Amazon” as an appeal to reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jessica, a number of the off-brand products that she has reviewed — especially items like clothes and home goods — are perfectly adequate. “It’s their way of marketing,” she said, adding that “the products aren’t necessarily worse than something you’d buy with a name brand on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes the products are worse, and Jessica still rates them 5 stars. “I haven’t found a thermometer by doing this that works correctly — they all give me different readings,” she said. Jessica is afraid to use the electronic appliances she receives, which often come with incomprehensible instructions written in both English and Chinese. She took photos of one product, a foot spa, without adding water or plugging it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica also doesn’t trust health and beauty products on the site, because of her boyfriend, a chemist, who has found toxic ingredients in analyses of unregulated products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coworker at Jessica’s day job once asked her about a keratin hair mask she had seen Jessica review. But Jessica hadn’t actually used the mask, and explained how the hustle really works. “She was noticeably disappointed that she trusted the review. I really felt bad!” Jessica said. She offered the coworker her unused bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I definitely feel like I have to keep [the reviewing] a secret from people who have strong morals,” Jessica added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reviewing is becoming too time-consuming and risky (sometimes sellers will disappear without sending her the promised money), so Jessica is starting to find freebies through other channels. Rather than dealing with sellers on an ad hoc basis herself, she now prefers to go through rebate platforms like RebateKey, even if it means waiting for longer periods of time — past the return window — for her money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebate websites offer Amazon products at deep discounts or for free and streamline the process for giveaway seekers like Jessica. The fake purchases increase the item's sales rank, which can help attract more genuine sales. To receive a full refund, she agrees to buy the item on Amazon within a certain time period, submits her order number to the seller as proof of purchase, and, most importantly, promises to not return the item. The websites wait 35 days, after Amazon’s return window closes, to refund Jessica through PayPal, and don’t require a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s stance on rebate sites, but Chris McCabe, a former Amazon employee turned consultant for sellers, said it’s against the company’s seller code of conduct. McCabe knows this — his clients have had their accounts frozen after using the sites to manipulate an item’s sales rank. (The suspended sellers are required to name the rebate site they used as a part of Amazon's reinstatement process, he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For honest brands, [the rebate sites] are a devastating loophole,&quot; commented James Thomson, another former Amazon employee who is now with Buy Box Experts, a consultancy for sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if she’s caught&lt;/strong&gt;, Jessica said, at least she’ll still be able to shop: “If they catch me, I’ve heard from other people that they wipe your review history but they don’t disable your account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica thinks it’s worth the risk. She loves getting free stuff, even when it turns out to be junk: “It’s mostly for the thrill of buying. I haven’t had the need to do any retail therapy all year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through reviewing herself, Jessica now knows that many Amazon reviews are inauthentic. Despite that, she pays for a $119 annual Prime membership and uses the site for personal purchases, separate from her fake reviews. But she doesn’t consider reviews while browsing: “When I see an off-brand product that’s Amazon’s Choice, [that label] doesn’t mean anything to me anymore,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every day, customers on Amazon are being shown things that aren’t true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But reviews &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; meaningful to many Amazon shoppers. Despite the company’s claims of policing millions of bogus reviews, the persistence of Facebook groups dedicated to generating illegitimate reviews of products, the rebate sites, and people like Jessica suggest that many, many more are posted every day. Even savvy customers will have trouble discerning genuine reviews from commissioned ones, and unsuspecting patrons will be duped into buying cheap products with inflated ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake reviews and sales immediately penalize honest businesses, but they ultimately hurt the site’s shoppers, Thomson said: “Every day, customers on Amazon are being shown things that aren’t true. They will lose trust in the site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short of shutting down the rebate websites, Thomson thinks that sellers, who flout the rules with impunity, should be kicked off for breaking the rules — but that Amazon also needs to penalize customers like Jessica: “Amazon needs to suffocate the consumer demand for free stuff.” ●&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google to restrict political adverts worldwide</title>

                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Social media ads&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10BE1/production/_109677586_c93b2d6f-70fc-4dbf-b144-7b09baaad073-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Google is extending a ban on political campaigns targeting advertising at people based on their supposed political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said political groups would soon only be able to target ads based on &quot;general categories&quot; such as age, gender and rough location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This restriction is already in place in the UK and the rest of the EU but will be imposed worldwide on 6 January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have big implications for next year's US Presidential vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said it would also clarify under what circumstances it would remove political ads for making &quot;false claims&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Google would remove ads that falsely claimed that a candidate had died or that gave the wrong date for an election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it would not ban claims that you cannot trust a rival party, for instance, which would be viewed as being a matter of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman told the BBC the new guidance would be provided within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's approach to deliberately misleading statements puts it at odds with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg said his social network &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50152062&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;would not fact-check advertising&lt;/a&gt; from political candidates or campaigns, although it has since stressed that this does not amount to a totally hand-off approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We prohibit misinformation about voting and do not allow ads which contain content previously debunked by our third party fact-checkers,&quot; said a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we've said, we are looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, meanwhile, has said it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50243306&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;disallow political advertising altogether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s new policy puts it somewhere roughly in the middle, suggesting a hands-off approach, with only the the most obvious misinformation being acted upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recognise that robust political dialogue is an important part of democracy, and no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim, and insinuation,” said Scott Spencer, Google’s head of product management for Google Ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited - but we will continue to do so for clear violations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;The databases explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision to impose a global ban on political campaigns matching their own databases of prospective voters against Google's user base is set to have major ramifications ahead of next year's US Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, strategists could use this to target individuals across platforms such as YouTube and Google Search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a user’s browsing habits - such as what news websites they frequent - Google makes an assumption about whether that user has left- or right-leaning political views. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US - but not in other countries, including the UK - political campaigns had the option to target people based on their political leaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was however possible for campaigns in other countries to upload their own lists of contact details - a database of party members, for example - to Google, which would then match it with users on its service so ads could reach those people directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will no longer be allowed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will take some time to implement these changes,” Mr Spencer added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaigns, like any other advertiser, can still place ads against specific types of content  - such as videos about football or articles on the economy - Google said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any action taken against advertising deemed to be against its polices will be logged on &lt;a href=&quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/region/GB?hl=en&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Google’s Transparency Report section&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details about deleted ads will appear on the page, but not the advertisement itself. Google said this data would remain downloadable so it could be independently analysed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political advertising makes up a relatively small amount of Google’s total advertising revenues, which totalled $116bn in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since March 2019, for example, Google’s figures suggest just £171,250 has been spent on political advertising ads within the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, campaigns have spent $128m on Google ads since the firm started publishing data on the region in May 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest spender, the “Trump Make America Great Again Committee”, has spent $8.5m on Google since that date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update 21 November: This article has been changed to reflect the fact in the UK and EU, Google already prevents political parties from targeting ads to users' based on their political views. The original version was based on a blog from the company that incorrectly suggested it would only begin enforcing the rule in the UK within a week and the EU by the end of the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Dave Lee &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/daveleebbc&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

<title>Disable new Slack WYSIWYG editor with this bookmarklet</title>
<link>https://github.com/kfahy/slack-disable-wysiwyg-bookmarklet</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/kfahy/slack-disable-wysiwyg-bookmarklet</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disables the WYSIWYG editor in Slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2019-11-20 Slack rolled out a new version of the editor. This editor features &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; functionality, which shows all message formatting inline in the text box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this time, Slack does not allow users to disable this functionality and revert back to the plaintext markdown editor. Until Slack implements this functionality, you can use this bookmarklet to temporarily disable all WYSIWYG A/B tests, which should restore the old editor functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In the browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;As a browser extension&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pocc/no-wysiwyg&quot;&gt;pocc/no-wysiwyg&lt;/a&gt; for Chrome (pending review) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-slack-wysiwyg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;As a bookmarklet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste into the URL field of a browser bookmark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to a Slack workspace in that browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the bookmarklet to disable the WYSIWYG editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat each time you reload slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In the desktop app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the slack app in Developer mode
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Mac: &lt;code&gt;export SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU=true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; open -a /Applications/Slack.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On PC in a Powershell window (per user install): &lt;code&gt;$env:SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU=&quot;true&quot;; &amp;amp; &quot;$($env:LOCALAPPDATA)\Slack\slack.exe&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On PC in a Powershell window (machine wide install): &lt;code&gt;$env:SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU=&quot;true&quot;; &amp;amp; &quot;$($Env:ProgramFiles)\Slack Deployment\slack.exe&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On other OS's: ensure the &lt;code&gt;SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU&lt;/code&gt; environment variable is set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; before opening the Slack app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click in the app and &lt;em&gt;Inspect element&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste into the Console tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat each time you reload slack or switch to a team for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In Franz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meetfranz/franz&quot;&gt;Franz&lt;/a&gt; is an Electron-based messaging aggregator application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Slack opened inside Franz, use the keyboard shortcut to open up the inspector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mac: &lt;kbd&gt;⌘ command&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;⌥ option&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;I&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows/Linux: &lt;kbd&gt;⌃ ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;⇧ shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;I&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up the console tab, and run the following to open up the current Slack instance's dev console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;.app__service .is-active webview&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;openDevTools&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the newly opened console window, paste in the script from &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; without the &lt;code&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
