&lt;p&gt;The world is still reeling from the New Zealand Christchurch attacks that occurred on March 15, 2019. The deadliest act of terrorism in the country’s history left at least 50 dead and at least 50 more wounded. As news of the victims continues to trickle in, we have learned that one of the casualties of the massacre was 33-year-old Atta Elayyan, a legend of the New Zealand &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; scene who played under the nickname “crazyarab” or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c784b587bdbe86b5a6a5e9&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the most interesting men in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking into Counter-Strike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elayyan, a Kuwait-born New Zealander, first discovered &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; in 2002. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/451018-Where-are-you-now?p=9063641#post9063641&quot;&gt;In his own words&lt;/a&gt;, while he never broke in with any major teams through &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;1.3 – 1.6&lt;/em&gt;, his early adoption of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Source&lt;/em&gt; paid off. When his old clan broke up, he moved on to join a “bunch of randoms” going by the squad name NewType. The team was unknown at the time but was committed to winning. The group spent hours playing and practicing together, until they had eventually taken down all of the top Australian teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15.508532423208&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my beloved .ar clan split up, I took a stab and decided to join the new kids on the block… a bunch of ‘randoms’ who called themselves NewType. Nobody had heard of Grudge, Atvar or Supertech at this stage but these guys were insanely hell bent on winning and we spent 6-7 hours a night, every night playing Australians where we eventually toppled all of their top teams. With most of the top CSNZ players still tied up in 1.6, we were fairly unstoppable winning xLAN after xLAN and nearly every online comp we entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Atta “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4b08390b31320a392a29&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;” Elayyan, July 13, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewType’s short run was one of dominance in the region. A list of the team’s accolades can be found on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/258109-Newtype-Results&quot;&gt;GamePlanet&lt;/a&gt;, which documents 7 first place finishes, and 12 Top-3 finishes, out of 15 events. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/258118-Newtype-History&quot;&gt;Elayyan departed the team in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and while he wasn’t around the scene for a very long time, he was a pioneer for the region and left a lasting impression on the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life after gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the man was an excellent &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; player, Atta Elayyan had no shortage of talents. If ever there were a way to move on to an even more interesting life after spending time as a pro-gamer, Atta lived it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His decline in &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; only came as a result of focusing on final-year university exams for a degree in Computer Science. After graduating, he worked as a UX designer for FireTrust, a computer security company. Shortly after that, he started his own entrepreneurial project called Chatflow. Elayyan’s big break eventually came in 2010, when he and friend Mike Choeung got together to build &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://lazywormapps.com/&quot;&gt;Lazyworm Apps&lt;/a&gt;, a media solutions company focused on developing programs for the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazyworm went on to develop major apps like MetroTube and Tweetro+ and worked closely with large companies like Microsoft, Mediaworks, and Aramex. According to Nigel Parker, a principal software engineer at Microsoft, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nzigel/atta-elayyan-a-great-new-zealander-276bfc3e8b02&quot;&gt;MetroTube was, at one point, the most popular app on the Windows store.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elayyan was featured in a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF9lD_QxgPg&quot;&gt;September 2012 keynote on Microsoft Ignite as one of New Zealand’s top Windows app developers.&lt;/a&gt; He was also recognized by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/658893/atta-elayyan-cio100-leader-one-of-victims-of-christchurch-massacre/&quot;&gt;CIO100&lt;/a&gt; as “one of New Zealand’s most transformative technology and digital leaders” in both &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/616197/cio100-2017-31-100-atta-elayyan-lwa-solutions/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/635193/cio100-2018-31-100-atta-elayyan-lwa-solutions/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article for Medium, Parker spoke at length on Elayyan’s acumen as a developer, and his character as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta had that rare blend of engineering and design. His strength was understanding people and building user interfaces that worked best the way that we do. He wanted to build consumer apps that delighted people and attempted to reach as many people as possible. He didn’t want to sell users to advertisers or build platforms that prayed on people’s needs to pay for the best experiences. Instead he poured everything into the software he created, made it available for free without ads or tracking data and then invited people to pay if they liked the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Nigel Parker, Principal Software Engineer for Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker went on to note that, despite facing failures on a regular basis, Atta stayed positive. He’d mark every milestone by taking every member of his projects out to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Christchurch’s own Clark Kent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the transition from trailblazing &lt;em&gt;CS:S&lt;/em&gt; pro to trailblazing app developer, Atta Elayyan spent a significant amount of his life on computers. But he wasn’t just your average nerd. He was just as much of a competitor physically as he was in the worlds of gaming and tech. As if his bio wasn’t already impressive enough, Elayyan was also the starting goalkeeper for the New Zealand Futsal Whites, the country’s national indoor-soccer team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_19616&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-19616&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-19616&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Atta Elayyan was also a goalkeeper for the New Zealand national futsal team&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team.jpeg 800w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-291x194.jpeg 291w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-240x160.jpeg 240w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-81x54.jpeg 81w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-19616&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo from FutsalPlanet (@futsalplanet97)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;New Zealand Football&lt;/a&gt;, Elayyan was a “hugely popular member of the futsal community” and competed in 19 A Internationals for the Futsal Whites organization. He was also a cornerstone of the Canterbury United Futsal Dragons team. According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/111348435/new-zealand-football-mourning-christchurch-shootings-victim-futsal-white-atta-elayyan&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a day before the attacks, Elayyan had met with Ronan Naicker, a good friend and Mainland Football’s futsal development officer, to pick up gear for the Christchurch Boys’ futsal team. Elayyan was set to coach the Christchurch Boys’ High School team at the secondary school nationals at Wellington this coming Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naicker, who himself had coached Elayyan and the Canterbury Dragons to two national championships (and a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/attaelayyan/status/541462032386514944&quot;&gt;Player of the Year award for Elayyan&lt;/a&gt;), had this to say on his friend’s tragic death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;He tried to give back to his old school by coaching teams. Even though he didn’t have the time he still found time and he did it all for nothing. He never asked for anything in return. He was a truly exceptional human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;– Ronan Naicker, Christchurch futsal development officer for Mainland Football&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Stuff,&lt;/em&gt; he also worked with the goalkeepers for the Canterbury women’s team, who won the inaugural national league title this past February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond football, it seems Elayyan also had an avid interest in automobiles. He built a custom E30 340i V8 BMW which, according to a video posted on his own YouTube channel, won the award for Best 8 Cylinder Vehicle at a “South Islands Champs” show and shine competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A lasting impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short time since it was discovered that Atta Elayyan was one of the 50 people murdered in the Christchurch massacre, the outpouring of support from the community has been resounding. Peers, teammates, gamers and friends alike have openly offered respects and tributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.com.au/threads/528025-RIP-Cr-zyArab&quot;&gt;Atvar, a &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; teammate from NewType, shared the following words on GamePlanet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am honoured to have known Atta from our days back in 2005-2009 playing &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;. He was one of the kindest, and [friendliest members] of the [CSNZ] community. He never had a bad word to say about anyone, and in my two to three years of playing with him, I don’t remember him ever speaking in anger to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stayed with myself and my parents for the odd LAN and they found him to be a very polite and well-mannered individual. He was driven to reach his potential in all aspects of his life and also assisted others in fulfilling their potential too. I will cherish the times we spent playing together and hope to emulate your best qualities where I can. He really was the best of us in the [&lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt;] community and I will miss you brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;New Zealand Football Interim Chief Executive Andrew Pragnell had this to say:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still hard to comprehend what happened in Christchurch on Friday afternoon. On behalf of everyone at New Zealand Football our thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who has been affected by these heinous acts of violence.  My heart goes out to the futsal community. They are a very tight-knit group and this news of Atta’s death will be devastating for all involved in the game. We feel their pain and their grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a referee and he never had a bad word to say about anything. He’s just a genuine man – heart of gold, not only for his culture, but his family and the futsal community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;He was somebody you would follow. He wasn’t someone that was trying to be a leader, he just naturally was by his personality… That’s why it’s so tragic because he set an example of someone that can seamlessly integrate across a faith, a community, and religions. It was never an issue when it came to that for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great privilege to have known and played alongside such [an] incredible man. He has left a big hole in the futsal community and will be forever missed. Atta was a genuine, loyal, and committed man in every aspect of his life. He was well respected by everyone in the futsal community and you couldn’t have met a nicer man, who always made time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;Josh Margetts, the Futsal Development Manager for New Zealand, also once played alongside Elayyan:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta was a great man and well-liked by everyone in the Futsal Whites squad and the futsal community. There are no words to sum up how we are all feeling. There is huge hole in our hearts as we come to terms with the loss of a great person and a good mate. He will be sorely missed. To Atta’s family, we are deeply sorry for your loss. We can’t imagine what you are going through, but please know we love you and we are here for you during this incredibly difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta Elayyan to me was one of those people that you are lucky to meet in your lifetime. He was a genuine leader, talented designer and inspiring entrepreneur… Atta was a friend who gave so much to everyone that knew him. What he achieved in his short life is more than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raised to the top of everything he applied his energy to, he took risks, he was unafraid of failure and he failed often, yet he was humble and believed in collaboration over competition in everything he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is [a] hole that has opened up inside me that will take time to heal but instead of hate we must stand together, encourage diversity and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gone, but never forgotten&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta, an Arabic name, means &lt;em&gt;gift&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;to give&lt;/em&gt;. By every account that’s come forth about the man since his passing, Atta Elayyan lived up to his name. He gave to his community. He gave to his teammates. He gave it his all in pursuing his passions. He was a relentlessly interesting and talented man that smiled in the face of adversity and took every failure in stride. In his short time on this planet, his kindness, charisma and work ethic touched many different people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would ever be in a position to say this however I actually owe a lot to [&lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;]. I would have never gotten into the tech industry had I not been obsessed with gaming during those years and the hours of focus, intense game play and desire to succeed has actually helped me alot in many aspects of my life. Of course, even if it was a complete waste of time, the people and friends I met during those years made it worth it &lt;img class=&quot;inlineimg&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/skins/gpforums/images/smilies/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I tell my 17 year old self to do it again?… Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elayyan’s father was with him at the time of his death and was among the few that survived the attack. Elayyan also left behind a wife, Farah, and a two-year-old daughter, Aya.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU government websites have undisclosed adtech trackers from Google and others</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/18/cookie_government_tracking_report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/18/cookie_government_tracking_report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;All but three of the European Union member states' government websites are littered with undisclosed adtech trackers from Google and other firms, with many piggy-backing on third-party scripts, according to an analysis of almost 200,000 webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cookiebot.com/media/1121/cookiebot-report-2019-medium-size.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), published today by Cookiebot in collaboration with civil rights association European Digital Rights (EDRi), scanned 184,683 EU government webpages on 11 and 12 March to assess the cookies on each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that there were 112 companies slurping up information on EU citizens' browsing habits on the webpages of the governments supposedly fighting the good fight against excess stalking of netizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adtech trackers were found on 25 of the 28 member states' sites, with only Spain, Germany and the Netherlands clean of commercial cookies. There were 52 companies identified on France's government sites, 27 on Latvia's and 19 on Belgium's. Twenty cookies were &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uz5lrz5bqglracj/AAD9s8fzdpZem1KE-1KvNKqFa/UK?dl=0&amp;amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1&quot;&gt;identified on GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;, of which 12 were marketing, and all belonged to one company – Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the search giant is described as the &quot;kingpin of tracking&quot; within the report, present on 82 per cent of all the sites and accounting for three of the top five trackers: YouTube, DoubleClick and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report authors said this was of &quot;special concern&quot; because Google can cross-reference trackers with its first-party account details via its widely used consumer services such as Mail, Search and Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the work assessed public health service sites, again finding that cookies were widespread, with 52 per cent of those tested having commercial trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, Google was right up there, making up two of the top five, with the others being Adobe's eversttech.net, AppNexus' adnxs.com and Mediamath's Mathtag.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this assessment, the researchers chose six EU countries and carried out 15 health-related search queries – such as &quot;How do I know if I have HIV?&quot;, &quot;Signs of being an alcoholic&quot; and &quot;I want to terminate my pregnancy&quot; – from IP addresses in each country to identify the relevant landing pages on each nation's health service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, some 60 per cent of these landing pages had such ad trackers, less only than Irish sites, where trackers appeared on 73 per cent of landing pages. A single German website about maternity leave was monitored by 63 companies, while a French page about abortion was tracked by 21 firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group said this could be used to &quot;infer sensitive facts about [users'] health condition and life situation&quot; and be resold to target ads. &quot;These citizens have no clear way to prevent this leakage, understand where their data is sent, or to correct or delete the data,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of tracking on these sites is even more alarming, the report argued, because they don't rely on ad revenue. In some cases, governments will want to use companies' services, but in others the firms gained access to these non-commercial sites through &quot;free&quot; third-party JavaScript tech services, like share buttons or plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These scripts can act as Trojan horses, opening backdoors to the website code through which ad tech companies can silently insert their trackers,&quot; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged website owners to be more careful when including third-party components on their sites; to make sure they had a detailed overview of the current trackers; and to remove any unwanted ones from the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors should also be offered full transparency and control over trackers on the site – but it shouldn't just be up to users to lock down their browsing habits. Stronger regulations need to be in force, and adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can any organisation live up to its [European General Data Protection Regulation] GDPR and ePrivacy obligations if it does not control unauthorised tracking actors accessing their website?&quot; asked Cookiebot founder Daniel Johannsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Public sector bodies now have the opportunity to lead by example – at a minimum by shutting down any digital rights infringements that they are facilitating on their own websites.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego Naranjo at EDRi used the opportunity to lament the delay to the long-awaited &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/11/european_parliament_eprivacy_rapporteur_birgit_sippel_interview/&quot;&gt;ePrivacy Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially meant to be enforced as the yin to the GDPR's yang, covering communications data rather than personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it has been &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/02/2019_eprivacy_brexit/&quot;&gt;stuck in discussions&lt;/a&gt; between member states for more than a year, and privacy activists fear it is being watered down as a result of lobbying from adtech industry and concerns among member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it does lose ground, Naranjo warned, it will &quot;open a Pandora's box of more and more sharing, merging and reselling of personal data in huge online commercial surveillance networks, in which citizens are being unwittingly tracked and micro-targeted with commercial and political manipulation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their calls for progress echo those made by the European Data Protection Board last week. The group – made up of the bloc's data protection watchdogs and EU data protection supervisor – issued a statement urging legislators to &quot;intensify efforts&quot; to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The future ePrivacy Regulation should under no circumstance lower the level of protection offered by the current ePrivacy Directive and should complement the GDPR by providing additional strong guarantees for all types of electronic communications,&quot; it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2019/european-data-protection-board-eighth-plenary-session-interplay-eprivacy-directive_en&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Working at Stripe Has Been Like</title>
<link>https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; two years ago to make starting an Internet business easier, mostly by work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. After founding four small software companies I wanted peers to deal with less nonsense, either by productizing a solution to it or by writing up the things I wish I had known back in 2006 when I started. In the same spirit, here’s what I didn’t know prior to joining Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-you-do-anyway&quot;&gt;What is it you do, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe’s mission is increasing the GDP of the Internet. Mine is increasing the number of successful software companies on it. That is basically the entirety of the job description. On a day-to-day basis, it’s very Choose Your Own Adventure; I’ve written code, requirements documents, strategy memos, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas guides&lt;/a&gt; and advised Stripe employees, partners, and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is… not a straightforward thing to write on a business card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it gives me huge amounts of latitude to determine my day-to-day direction, and makes use of having a wide skillset. Relatively few people can solo ship an initiative which requires copywriting, React, an ETL pipeline, and a business negotiation; it turns out that is pretty valuable and decreasing the time-to-market of it (versus having to spin up a team of five people to do the same work) is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are reasons why job descriptions exist; they help communicate one’s position to others at the company, clarify discussions about dependency graphs, give decisionmakers a handle when plans are made, etc etc. Being the singleton instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Stripe::Atlas::Patio11&lt;/code&gt; is occasionally a mixed blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-else-do-you-do&quot;&gt;What else do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from “continuing to be my usual (hopefully) helpful self on the Internet,” I also try to contribute outside my formal role. One of the things I enjoy most about Stripe’s work culture is the notion that “nothing is Not My Job.” My first real pull request at Stripe was fixing a security bug; I was quite happy to learn that they meant what they had said in spinup about that, and that the Security team spent time getting my code up to scratch even though I looked like “random business (?) guy at the Japan office” in the company directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe touches a &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; large subset of human endeavor (basically, “just the things that involve money”). We operate at a scale which is both tiny relative to commerce on the Internet (which is, itself, nowhere near its asymptote yet) and yet already very material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite projects have been ruining bad guys’ days. Our users have a lot of money flowing through us daily; every bad guy on the Internet wants it; we are in a constant footrace with all of them. There are a lot of smart people who work all day every day to frustrate them; I have been able to help a time or ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example: we had an internal red-team exercise run as a contest: figure out how to steal All The Money, bonus points if one would probably get away with it. Folks across the company did security research and wrote up their findings; responsible teams then got oodles of high-quality fodder for remediation without us having actually lost a dollar. I won the contest with a few dozen submissions. We closed classes of vulnerabilities as a consequence of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various efforts here (security, risk management, etc) benefit quite a bit from understanding what is technically possible, being able to implement it quickly, and having a good mental model for business in the small (“What’s normal behavior for an Internet-based software business?”) and the large (“Where are the weak points in global financial infrastructure, and how do we manage our exposure to them?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pitch in on (depending on the day) product strategy, writing, company culture building, organizational issues, supporting the Japan team, engineering recruiting, advising Stripe customers (often, very literally, to charge more), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-work-at-stripe-when-you-could-run-your-own-business&quot;&gt;Why work at Stripe when you could run your own business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;leverage_aside&quot;&gt;Leverage means things which increase your capability to provide impact. For example, writing code is an extremely leveraged use of your time; you go off to continue living your life but your code keeps running. Some leveraged things I've done are writing, writing software, making businesses which employed people other than me, and joining forces with smart people to work on the problems I seek to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran my own businesses for a number of years, including a startup with co-founders, and greatly enjoyed the experience, but I felt like I was maxing out on the challenges available in running small software companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also felt like it was constraining the absolute amount of impact I had for the world. The parts of the job which I enjoyed the most were not my actual job (writing and selling software, filing taxes in a timely fashion, etc) but helping other software entrepreneurs optimize their businesses or engineers navigate career challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinakwok&quot;&gt;Kevin Kwok&lt;/a&gt; asked “Leverage on what?”. Fifteen years into this career thing I definitely know what my success function for the next thirty is: the product of the number of people I’ve helped in the community I serve (software people, broadly writ) times the delta in the average life that my efforts uniquely caused. If one uses e.g. income as a metric because it’s crunchy enough to keep one honest, then the most effective thing I’ve ever done (by &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; on an ROI-on-time basis) was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/&quot;&gt;salary negotiation for engineers&lt;/a&gt;. A few hundred folks have emailed me the outcomes they attribute to that essay; this lower-bounds the impact to score of that essay at about 7,000,000 (a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe offers a much larger platform to scalably educate and advise entrepreneurs from, and unlike my own companies, it structurally benefits directly from doing that. (There were some indirect benefits to e.g. Bingo Card Creator from me writing a few million words, but Stripe benefits &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; from every artifact we produce which makes N businesses more successful at the margin. The company-level mission is “Increase the GDP of the Internet”; every time we increase the pace of business formation, the likelihood of business survival, or the rate of business growth, we win.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my professional output over the past 12 years has been making businesses ~1% better and repeating that. This was an interesting game to play for Bingo Card Creator, but it was a lot more lucrative when doing it for consulting clients. Stripe’s scale allows some decisions to be &lt;em&gt;quite leveraged indeed&lt;/em&gt;, both directly and at our customers’ businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(An example which is just a &lt;em&gt;boggling&lt;/em&gt; fact about the world: what’s your finger-to-a-wind guesstimate about what percentage of credit card payments fail with error code I Don’t Know Sometimes Things Fail In Credit Card Land? Hint: it’s higher than you think. Those failed payments cost conversions at the margin. When Stripe fights that number down by &lt;em&gt;a basis point&lt;/em&gt;, that creates value across our entire portfolio, forever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe’s network is far wider than mine, and where appropriate, I can trade on our organizational karma. This lets me do things which require collaboration from folks who I probably couldn’t just call in my personal capacity. An example: I can probably speculate my fingers off in HN comments about how to pitch an investor, but as a Stripe, I can collaborate directly with YC on optimizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/pitching&quot;&gt;the advice&lt;/a&gt; to their partners’ true desiderata in looking at companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of time I’ve spent on low-value business administration has declined from about 10~20% of my week (really!) to functionally zero. A surprising portion of running my own businesses was contract negotiation, making sure vendors got paid, and wiring profits in time to make rent. We have people who specialize in all those things so I no longer have to. (I miss getting woken up because a server had… just kidding, I do not miss that at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cost is that organizations eventually reach a point where “Just get a bunch of smart people in the room and let them do whatever” ceases to cause spontaneous order and begins to cause chaos. We’re well past that point. This means that we need some sort of planning and managerial processes, and while I interact quirkily with them I do interact materially with them. That interaction is an overhead on personal productivity. It isn’t a small overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for leverage also means occasionally having to pick projects other than the ones I’d want to do ceteris paribus. Stripe would probably &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; me just lock myself in a room and write for N years, but that would likely greatly underperform the theoretical limit on impact, so I sometimes end up doing work which is more pressing for the company but less personally fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I occasionally miss doing my own thing? Yep, on at least a monthly basis, most particularly when working with entrepreneurs directly. I don’t have nearly the bandwidth to prototype anything material but I feel the siren call of it; I’m pretty sure my next adventure will be running a software business again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; feel as if being at Stripe has increased my aspirations with regards to that next business. Partly this is via exposure to a wide variety of companies in the ecosystem; entrepreneurs’ creativity never ceases to amaze me. (All else being equal, &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; choose a customer base whose creative use of what you build will surprise and delight you.) I’ve also had some time to crawl around the ducts of Internet commerce, which is a beautiful fractal described by an equation capable of summoning horrors from beyond spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the single biggest change in belief I’ve had since joining is that ambition properly harnessed can be an enormously productive force in the world. This is largely informed by working with people who are extremely ambitious and yet well-grounded, both at Stripe and at our customers. There is a great, great difference between “Build a credit card processor? That’s &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.” and “Build a credit card processor? That probably involves compliance with an enumerable set of regulations and writing a finite number of lines of code.” You want more people in your life who say the second version, probably at most margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, I think I agree with Tyler Cowen that &lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html&quot;&gt;raising others’ aspirations&lt;/a&gt; is an effective way to increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that Silicon Valley does this at scale is creating a space in the culture for being just a little bit wild-eyed when envisioning potential impact and then, this is important, actually shipping tractable engineering artifacts against the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often poked fun of when it is deployed in the service of ends people view as unserious or when done by folks who confabulate. I have probably made jokes like that before. I think I have come to regret them, because they’re &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; heard by people with serious goals who are scrupulous. The jokes, and the broader culture, discourage those people from trying extraordinarily ambitious things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I got a do-over on e.g. running my own businesses for a decade, I’d probably skip the relatively unambitious first two (which I did just because I knew I could probably do them) and proceed directly to trying things outside of my comfort zone. (I still have an enormous love in my heart for the aesthetics of small software businesses, but given a do-over, could have done much more interesting and impactful small software businesses earlier than I actually did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can simultaneously hold two thoughts at once: that unserious ends and lies are not positive, but that we probably underestimate the number of teams doing very important work in a startup-y fashion. They’re on-paper unqualified, they are often running on a shoestring, they don’t look like who Hollywood would cast as Obviously Important Person, and yet they &lt;em&gt;often outperform anyway&lt;/em&gt;. One of the best parts of my job is getting to help folks like this build their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably the single biggest revelation to me 15 years into my career, so, throwing it back in a bottle for any of y’all who are getting started. We might not have time travel yet, but the Internet is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-a-senior-individual-contributor&quot;&gt;Being a senior individual contributor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly to some folks who know me externally, I am not a manager (of Stripe Atlas or anything else). I’m an IC (“individual contributor”, a bit of widely-used jargon at companies large enough to have career tracks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in their careers, ICs mostly create value by doing “the work.” In one’s first year of e.g. being an IC engineer, you write code backing projects of varying complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one increases up the skill curve, ICs continue doing “the work” while also spending an increasing amount of time on non-managerial metawork, like contributing in a directed fashion to the organizational culture, setting strategic directions, mentoring others (including managers), setting up systems and processes by which the work will be done in the future, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe has an explicit career path available to ICs in engineering and elsewhere. It is designed to avoid the relatively industry common failure mode that, as one advances in one’s career, one either has to start doing management or compromise quite a bit on career impact and outcomes. Management is a useful professional specialization but you probably shouldn’t do it if other specializations are more highly leveraged uses of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great sources of leverage is other people. You can get leverage via directing folks to do things (a superpower whose impact I probably underappreciated when running my business solo). You can also get it by making them more effective at doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I work with folks at Stripe, I try to make them more instrumentally effective at working the organization, at understanding the broader business context for individual units of work, at understanding the startup ecosystem and the mindset and challenges of our users, etc. For folks in particularly focused roles, I try to put in place efforts to make them better at the core content of their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I write a lot at Stripe, but Stripe now has a number of people for whom that statement is true. I could plausibly ship X00,000 words in a year, but one eventually hits a plateau there; there is no plateau if the shippable thing is making other writers more instrumentally effective. This sometimes come from directly editing work but more often from teaching, sometimes about the craft of writing specifically and sometimes more Stripe-specific nuances like how to reproduce the company voice. (I also wrote a non-trivial amount of code because, fun fact, stripe.com spells CMS e-r-b, which didn’t optimize for writers’ ability to ship new words.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Julia Evans has an essay on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/&quot;&gt;being a senior engineer&lt;/a&gt; which discusses being a senior IC in a lot of detail specific to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sidenote: One way to substantial impact as a senior IC is providing an example of what senior IC-ship looks like for folks growing in their careers to aspire to; another is working with people explicitly to accelerate their growth towards it and beyond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-writing-writing&quot;&gt;Writing, writing, writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe is a celebration of the written word which happens to be incorporated in the state of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We produce prodigious amounts of it internally, most of it widely visible within the company. My favorite job perk might be that library; it includes everything from a crackling memo about current state of book publishing (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.stripe.com&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;) to experiment writeups about using machine learning to counter credit card fraud (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/radar&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;) to market analyses of SaaS adoption in Japanese businesses (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/billing&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected to write a shedload at Stripe, and I do. I didn’t expect most of it to be internally facing. Example: we have a lot more people at Stripe who need to know how to reason about a SaaS business than who have run SaaS businesses, so I locked myself in a room and data dumped about what I had learned in ten years. (We eventually published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas&quot;&gt;publicly available version&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I once had the typical engineer’s disdain for Strategy Memos (TM), but if you think of it as less a Strategy Memo (TM) and more a pull request for a very complicated program which directs the activities of dozens or hundreds of people, it gets a lot easier to stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about where Stripe is in Japan right now, what it would take for Stripe to be as impactful to the Japanese Internet as it has been to the US Internet, and what concrete steps we should take in 2019 to get us closer to that goal. It’s low-degree wild to me that I have something useful to contribute there, but one of the things the company does rather well is being a distributed responsibility machine. Working at BigCo counsels you that there is some expert in another castle who has already written the marching orders and all you have to do is execute your tiny assigned portion of them. At Stripe, you can order the metaphorical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=google+bezos+two+pizza+rule&quot;&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; and say “Good news: Stripe does have smart people working on the go-to-market plan for the world’s third largest economy. We just bought them a single large pizza.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could certainly write the Strategy Memo equivalent of bikeshedding on indentation rules. Try not to do that or to work with people who enjoy doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside about indentation rules: the right way to do all stylistic arguments is to enforce them with code, and make the &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; supported interface for stylistic arguments pull requests against the linter/compiler rather than comments on individual engineers’ work. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go fmt&lt;/code&gt; might be the single best feature of Golang for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Stripe, there are a lot of things which are valid Ruby which are nonetheless illegal. A trivial example would be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@improper_casing_for_ruby&lt;/code&gt;. A more meaningful example would be calling into another team’s code from outside a defined boundary. Since a linter catches essentially all of those, if one finds oneself nitpicking a pull request, one should generally either a) fix the linter or b) find something productive to do with one’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of many, many ways that considered use of technology helps to ameliorate human problems. One of the joys of working in a tech company is that they seem to have a comparative advantage on grokking this, and on self-modifying tools to more closely fit the desired way they want to work. This is one reason I expect 2019’s employment of engineers to be the lowest number for the rest of time: every organization which cares about the social reality of work would benefit from being able to compose their own tools. (That feels like a contentious claim, but it isn’t socially contentious to say that basically every organization considers leadership to be too critical to outsource, and leadership is just programming for organizations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-very-remote&quot;&gt;Being (very) remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe is expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/global&quot;&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt; rapidly, but most folks who I interact with on a day-to-day basis are in San Francisco. This is occasionally challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eagerness to please, for my first year, I did not establish great boundaries around e.g. acceptable meeting times, and ended up taking a lot at, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://everytimezone.com/zones/009e62fa&quot;&gt;11 AM PST&lt;/a&gt;. After pulling out quite a bit of hair around my sleep schedule, I eventually blocked off my sleeping hours on my calendar; this was a major improvement in quality of life. These days I get up early (7 AM, generally) to have meetings, take a hard break to spend time with my kids before school, and then head into the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks ask me about work/life balance a lot. I (candidly) worry that I don’t always set a great example for my team or the office on this; I have periods which are quite crunchy interspersed by lulls, and even at a shop which doesn’t count hours or reward facetime-for-the-sake-of-facetime I find myself falling back into salaryman mode too frequently. I’m happy to report that folks who are better about self-discipline and maintaining boundaries do successfully do so at Stripe, and generally without sacrificing actual or perceived effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think, particularly as companies mature, that they should generally evolve organizational alchemy to get greater-than-sum-of-the-parts effectiveness out of people with disparate working styles, in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-13/santander-didn-t-pay-its-non-debt&quot;&gt;businesses unite investors with differing tolerances for risk&lt;/a&gt; to bankroll common enterprise that no tolerance level could fully fund by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a question reasonable people can disagree on: is it OK to routinely have meetings at e.g. 7 PM? (I’m sympathetic to “Oh heck no” on this question, but note that if you want to support traditionally managed Japanese businesses that that won’t be a maximally effective response, and there are many other plausible reasons for someone to say, given their goals, values, and personal situation, “Actually, 7 PM meetings sound pretty reasonable to me. It’s not a crazy ask like e.g. showing up in an office at 9 AM, who does that.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have four people at your company, you probably need &lt;em&gt;almost total agreement&lt;/em&gt; on whether 7 PM meetings are a routine expectation. If you have 400, you can probably tolerate groups/roles/individuals/etc ending up at different equilibria on this question. Save your limited Total Agreement Mandatory points for the key differentiating values of your culture. (Stripe describes its organizational culture to candidates with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info&quot;&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fly to HQ about once a quarter, mostly to “meet old friends and make new ones.” It’s simultaneously incredibly useful and a bit jarring to, every single time, be in a lunchroom which has hundreds of people who were not there the last time I was in the lunchroom. Hypergrowth is a through-the-looking-glass sort of experience, particularly when you perceive it in slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to my team, which is the most supportive one I’ve ever been on. We added a number of new remote engineers recently, and the entire team worked from home for a week to understand the experience better and capture requirements for improving our communication norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company which seems tied to email and Slack at all working hours, it’s useful to understand that a lot of information is distributed around the lunch table and decisions get made in hallway conversations, neither of which is great for folks who can only perceive HQ through the Internet. A tiny thing someone built recently which I really love for helping on this: if you schedule a meeting between Stripes, a video conference link gets automatically added to the meeting, so that any remote employee who might need it doesn’t need to feel like they’re constantly having to interrupt meetings to remind someone to turn on the camera and distribute the link to the remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are rather aggressively expanding the cohort of remote Stripes, driven partly by improved technologies for collaboration (Zoom, Google Docs, etc), partly by happy experiences on many teams which experimented with adding remotes, partly by desire to attract and retain talented folks wherever they may be, and partly by desire to be more local to our customers, who are very widely distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which: at 2 PM PDT on Tuesday March 19th (&lt;a href=&quot;https://everytimezone.com/s/1ad71245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when?&lt;/a&gt;) we’re having a remote coffee for folks interested in casually chatting about what the experience of being a remote engineer at Stripe is like. I’ll be participating along with a few engineers and engineering managers. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.events/remote-coffee&quot;&gt;request an invitation&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a casual chat between geeks, but for what it is worth, a number of people who attended the last remote coffee now work with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fast-and-slow&quot;&gt;Fast and slow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, I can’t tell you Stripe’s growth rate for anything, but let’s talk about a stylized company called 2X, Inc., where every graph is growing at 2X per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at 2X breaks so many intuitive understandings of how the world should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day you start at 2X, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience. A year later, when you’re starting to get your sea legs, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience. A year later, when senior colleagues start forgetting that you were not actually there during the flood, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get numb to graphs after a while. Numbers flit in one ear and out the other; retaining any is almost pointless, because by the time one sinks into your consciousness it will not merely be wrong but glaringly wrong. 2X doubles every year and everyone laughs about how the planning department got it right again; it’s eerie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exhilarating and terrifying all at once, because almost nothing in nature grows at 2X a year over sustained periods. 2X is constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to sustain the growth, but simultaneous with the hunt is the challenge of doing anything meaningful with &lt;em&gt;that graph&lt;/em&gt; as a backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe isn’t 2X, Inc., but occasionally has some challenges that this stylized company has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to write dashboards and memos for people who &lt;em&gt;aren’t at the company yet&lt;/em&gt;; most users of the artifact aren’t. You’ve got to stick up your hand in meetings and say “Hey, you just said ‘sales funnel’: can you give me the maximally pedantic explanation of what that means.” (This is a good thing for senior folks to ask, because forcing folks who joined last week to interrupt to ask a basic question doesn’t set them up for comfort or success.) You have to employ professional educators (and eventually historians and anthropologists, for real), because you effectively run a postgraduate study program on the scale of a small university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to constantly course correct your understanding of what is material impact, because hopefully you’re searching for making material impact, and things that were material three years ago might not move the needle anymore. And things that were &lt;em&gt;outlandishly&lt;/em&gt; impossible three years ago might now be quite possible, and worth doing, but only if you can get to them in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to keep the culture to fight like hell for the expansive set of things which are very worth doing but which don’t obviously move needles. One reason I fly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microconf.com&quot;&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt; every year is to make sure we meet people who are hitting their first month of $1, $1k, or $10k worth of revenue and &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; understand what they need from us. We should not just prevent degradation of the experience for them but make it transformatively better than 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-things-which-matter&quot;&gt;Creating things which matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-time user of Stripe, as soon as I got git access, I went spelunking for where the magic behind the product pages lived. (If you’re not familiar at this: Stripe has a mostly deserved reputation for giving new product pages very well-designed treatments. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/billing&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; for general reference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: There is shockingly little magic, on that topic or anywhere else. The landing pages are an ERB file which starts out blank. It spits out HTML (and some CSS and Javascript), the same as every other page on the Internet. The reason those pages are phenomenal is that a very small group of very talented people care an almost unreasonable amount that they are phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route to great work is mostly a) hire small teams of very talented people who very intently care about something and b) incentivize great work amongst numerous other competing worthy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often phrase that as “Protect teams doing great work”, but I don’t think that is entirely correct. Mediocrity doesn’t happen because a villain kills good work then cackles maniacally. BigCo doesn’t set out to be mediocre… BigCo just has an awful lot of people with an awful lot on their plate, and many of them are incentivized to make locally-optimal decisions at the expense of competing global goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing organizational design and incentive structuring to solve the principal/agent problem internally and cause people to optimize for the global outcome at scale may be the hardest unsolved problem. (In management? In capitalism? In anything? Take your pick.) We’re working on it; concretely, it often involves making space for folks to say “What does the &lt;em&gt;best possible&lt;/em&gt; version of this project look like?” and being OK with e.g. delaying things until they are ready. (Note the implicit tension with doing that while one’s business and the environment are moving at Warp 7. None of the problems are easy, or there wouldn’t be any need to have smart people work on them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder in me thinks that a bit of experience in a large (or growing) organization is very useful for correcting one’s worldview and ability to anticipate the actions of future customers, counterparties, partners, etc at large organizations. That is a useful ability to have as a founder, and (somewhat surprisingly) we spend very little time at school teaching how large organizations actually make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are e.g. civics classes which can teach you the orthodox understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0&quot;&gt;legislative process&lt;/a&gt;, but it glosses over really important details to the real world, like e.g. how the regulated directly engage with their regulators to shape future legislation. I similarly think that no class about management or capitalism I’ve ever been in said “Sometimes the reason for an outrageous result isn’t a principal/agent problem or ‘Maximize the evil’ or incompetence, it is that writing a dashboard which would have surfaced the problem in time to fix it was beyond the SQL capabilities of the most directly responsible individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of SQL, I love our internal tooling. We have a number of engineers specifically dedicated to it; I think we could probably tolerate having five times as many as we do. Some of the things they’ve built that clearly would have helped every software company I’ve ever worked at: an easy way to automate (and thereby secure) somebody-needed-to-pop-open-a-console style tasks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep&quot;&gt;instant code search over the entire codebase&lt;/a&gt;, and a way to subscribe oneself for daily emails about state changes to a certain set of objects (e.g. “For all the accounts I manage, email me the list of any who hit $MILESTONE every morning, so I can reach out to congratulate them.”) One of the reasons I love our tooling is that there is an engineering-driven emphasis on composability, such that each additional tool we add makes wide swathes of our tooling (and operations) more valuable, often in unanticipated ways. I cannot bang the drum enough for investing in internal tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;id-love-to-chat-more-about-this&quot;&gt;I’d love to chat more about this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in hearing more about how the sausage gets made at scale, we’d love to chat. Come join us for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.events/remote-coffee&quot;&gt;remote coffee&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://everytimezone.com/s/1ad71245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when?&lt;/a&gt;), or you can always find me in the usual places on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/jobs&quot;&gt;Stripe is hiring&lt;/a&gt;. I like it here. If you think you would too, or are curious about figuring out whether that would be true, please find us on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Slack enables customers to control their encryption keys in enterprise version</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/slack-hands-over-encryption-keys-to-regulated-customers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/slack-hands-over-encryption-keys-to-regulated-customers</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; announced today that it is launching Enterprise Key Management (EKM) for &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;slack&quot;&gt;Slack,&lt;/a&gt; a new tool that enables customers to control their encryption keys in the enterprise version of the communications app. The keys are managed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kms/&quot;&gt;AWS KMS&lt;/a&gt; key management tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Belknap, chief security officer (CSO) at Slack, says the new tool should appeal to customers in regulated industries who might need tighter control over security. “Markets like financial services, healthcare and government are typically underserved in terms of which collaboration tools they can use, so we wanted to design an experience that catered to their particular security needs,” Belknap told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack currently encrypts data in transit and at rest, but the new tool augments this by giving customers greater control over the encryption keys that Slack uses to encrypt messages and files being shared inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that regulated industries in particular have been requesting the ability to control their own encryption keys, including the ability to revoke them if it was required for security reasons. “EKM is a key requirement for growing enterprise companies of all sizes, and was a requested feature from many of our Enterprise Grid customers. We wanted to give these customers full control over their encryption keys, and when or if they want to revoke them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1798214&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1798214&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1798214 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EKM-Imagery.png?resize=50,34 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1798214&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Screenshot: Slack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belknap says this is especially important when customers involve people outside the organization, such as contractors, partners or vendors in Slack communications. “A big benefit of EKM is that in the event of a security threat or if you ever experience suspicious activity, your security team can cut off access to the content at any time if necessary,” Belknap explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to controlling the encryption keys, customers can gain greater visibility into activity inside of Slack via the Audit Logs API. “Detailed activity logs tell customers exactly when and where their data is being accessed, so they can be alerted of risks and anomalies immediately,” he said. If a customer finds suspicious activity, it can cut off access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EKM for Slack is generally available today for Enterprise Grid customers for an additional fee. Slack, which announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/workplace-messaging-platform-slack-has-confidentially-filed-to-go-public/&quot;&gt;plans to go public&lt;/a&gt; last month, has raised more than $1 billion on a $7 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Myspace lost all the music its users uploaded between 2003 and 2015</title>

&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;It's been a year since the music links on Myspace stopped working; at first the company insisted that they were working on it, but now they've admitted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/7uiv8b/myspace_player_wont_play_songs_and_i_want_to/&quot;&gt;all those files are lost&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from Myspace. We apologize for the inconvenience and suggest that you retain your back up copies.

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/b2381s/myspace_lost_all_music_uploaded_from_2003_to_2015/&quot;&gt;they don't have a backup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, this will happen to Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, etc. Don't trust the platforms to archive your data. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; will host anything freely distributable, for free, forever, and they have mirrors of their servers in California, Egypt and Amsterdam. They're a mission-driven nonprofit supported by philanthropists, foundations, and small-money donations (I'm an annual donor).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Matrix 1.0 – Are We Ready Yet?</title>
<link>https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TL;DR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you run a Synapse ensure that your federation certificates are valid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/federationtester/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If they are not valid check out the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Follow along with progress at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arewereadyyet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://arewereadyyet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tell all your admin friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Folks, as you know we are now very close to achieving Matrix 1.0 and finally being in a position to shed our ‘beta’ tag. It has been a long time coming and speaks to the huge effort from hundreds of people over the past 5 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A critical step towards this goal is the release of Synapse 1.0. We want to ship Synapse 1.0 as soon as possible but can’t do so without your help!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’d like to introduce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arewereadyyet.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AreWeReadyYet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;– a quick and easy way for everyone to track the progress and check if their federation is ready for Matrix 1.0!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arewereadyyet.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4110 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-300x214.png&quot; alt=&quot;Are we ready yet?&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; srcset=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-300x214.png 300w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-768x548.png 768w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-400x284.png 400w, https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19.png 816w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Synapse 1.0 is good news for anyone running a Synapse installation – it contains critical bug fixes, security patches, a new room algorithm version and dramatically improved user and room search. However, as part of the security work it also&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;contains a breaking change from previous Synapse versions. From 1.0 onwards it will necessary to ensure a valid TLS certificate on the federation API. Self signed certificates will no longer be accepted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why would we do such a thing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In anticipation for this, everyone currently running a homeserver must ensure that they have checked their federation certificate (check yours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/federationtester/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Failure to do so will mean being unable to federate with any Matrix 1.0 compliant server. If your server fails the check, our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;has all the details on what you need to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post is a call to arms to try and get as many admins to upgrade their certificates as possible. We are tracking adoption at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arewereadyyet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://arewereadyyet.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;– currently this sits at about 55% – we need this figure to be higher before we can pull the lever.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what are you waiting for? Check that your server has valid certs – then tell all your admin pals to do the same.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Friends don’t let friends miss out on Synapse 1.0, send them to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arewereadyyet.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arewereadyyet.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(or tweet&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Are%20you%20running%20a%20Matrix%20server%3F%20Are%20you%20ready%20for%20Matrix%201.0%3F%20Find%20out%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Farewereadyyet.com!&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to remind them!)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;We really need the community to help us here because at some point soon, we will need to pull the lever and release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once we make more progress on adoption, we will announce an official release date and finally get Synapse out of beta!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
