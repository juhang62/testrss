<title>FaceTime bug lets you hear audio of person you are calling before they pick up</title>
<link>https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A significant bug has been discovered in FaceTime and is currently spreading virally over social media. The bug lets you call anyone with FaceTime, and immediately hear the audio coming from their phone — before the person on the other end has accepted or rejected the incoming call. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facetime-bug-iphone&quot;&gt;Apple says the issue will be addressed&lt;/a&gt; in a software update “later this week”. (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-calling-bug-fix/&quot;&gt;has taken Group FaceTime offline&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address the issue in the interim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this poses a pretty privacy problem as you can essentially listen in on any iOS user, although it still rings like normal, so you can’t be 100% covert about it. Nevertheless, there is no indication on the recipient’s side that you could hear any of their audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a second part to this which can expose video too …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9to5Mac has reproduced the FaceTime bug with an iPhone X calling an iPhone XR, but it is believed to affect any pair of iOS devices running iOS 12.1 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do the iPhone FaceTime bug:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start a FaceTime Video call with an iPhone contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whilst the call is dialling, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap Add Person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your own phone number in the Add Person screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will then start a group FaceTime call including yourself and the audio of the person you originally called, even if they haven’t accepted the call yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will look like in the UI like the other person has joined the group chat, but on their actual device it will still be ringing on the lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Major iPhone FaceTime bug lets you hear the audio of the person you are calling ... before they pick up&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-576500 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?w=509&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height=&quot;617&quot; srcset=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png 1116w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=94,130 94w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=509,700 509w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=768,1057 768w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=744,1024 744w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=254,350 254w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/IMG_3278.png?resize=727,1000 727w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whilst the call is ringing, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and add yourself to the call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage potential here is real. You can listen in to soundbites of any iPhone user’s ongoing conversation without them ever knowing that you could hear them. Until Apple fixes the bug, it’s not clear how to defend yourself against this attack either aside from disabling FaceTime altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, if your phone is ringing with an incoming FaceTime request, the person on the other end could be listening in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have also found is that if the person presses the Power button from the lock screen, their video is also sent to the caller — unbeknownst to them. In this situation, the receiver can now hear your own audio, but they do not know they are transmitting their audio and video back to you. From their perspective, all they can see is accept and decline. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jessassin/status/1090057063886086144&quot;&gt;Another update&lt;/a&gt;: It seems there are other ways of triggering the video feed eavesdrop too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also replicated the problem with an iPhone calling a Mac. By default, the Mac rings for longer than a phone so it can act as a bug for an even longer duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has said the issue will be fixed in a software update later in the week. Until then, if you are concerned, you &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/turn-off-facetime-iphone/&quot;&gt;should disable FaceTime in iOS Settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now you can answer for yourself on FaceTime even if they don’t answer🤒&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; explain this.. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gr8llRKZxJ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gr8llRKZxJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>64 and unemployed: One man&amp;#039;s struggle to be taken seriously as a job applicant</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David A. Wimsett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's an unpleasant routine. I send out resumes. I am careful to make sure my details go back only 20 years. There are no dates attached to my education history. Phone calls come. We talk about my background and experience. Some respond enthusiastically. We arrange a physical meeting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I dress in a suit. My hair is cut in a business style. I rehearse answers to questions I will likely be asked and practice responding in a professional, personable manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I arrive. &quot;Hello. I applied for your position as a software project manager.&quot; I extend my arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interviewer pauses and looks at me for a moment. &quot;I'm the head of human resources. Please sit down.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4992738.1548430797!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/david-a-wimsett.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;David Wimsett is from Kentville, N.S., and works every day to find a job. (Submitted by David Wimsett)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work hard to maintain a blank expression. They're trained to do that. But I can see past that right away. Their eyelids drop slightly, almost imperceptibly. So do their inner eyebrows. Few would notice. But I am a project manager. I've learned to constantly and carefully observe people to detect subtle, unconscious facial expressions that reveal hidden emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs I inevitably get from interviewers are ones of disapproval and disappointment. The decision has already been made: &lt;em&gt;too old. Out of touch with technology and youth. Not with it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I am very much with it. Every year, I read the equivalent of a university semester's worth of books and attend seminars to keep up with the industry and its latest trends. As a project manager, I work well with younger colleagues and form effective teams. My experience of nearly four decades allows me to spot patterns and trends to deliver effective solutions through wisdom and good judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not seem to matter. I am 64. I am too old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll get back to you,&quot; they say. They never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used all of my savings, including retirement accounts. I've sold everything I own of value. The one asset I have left is a 10-year-old car. It is my only means of transportation to job interviews out of my area. I have extended my credit to pay bills and purchase prescription medications. I am now deeply in debt and behind on payments. I get constant phone calls from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4202353.1499901530!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/statcan-household-debt-20170614.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;&quot;I have used all of my savings, including retirement accounts. I've sold everything I own of value,&quot; David Wimsett said. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir, you are behind on your scheduled payment. When can we expect to see the money?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't have any money I can give you at the moment. I have been unemployed for a long time.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caller's voice takes on a belligerent tone. &quot;You have a contractual agreement to pay a minimum amount every month. When will you make a payment?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I said, I have no income and I don't know when I will have any.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the voice become threatening. &quot;If we don't see a payment soon we will be forced to send the account to an outside collection service, who will sue you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you do, you will be paying lawyers and getting no money because I have none. But I have an interview next week and they were very enthusiastic on the phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pause comes. The voice returns with authority. &quot;Very well. We will check back in two weeks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calls come from a different person each time. I have to repeat the same story over and over. A credit counsellor advised me to be polite and answer truthfully. It takes huge effort to control my anger when callers insinuate that I'm hiding money somewhere. I only lost my composure once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my efforts are focused on getting work. I subscribe to internet job boards and make contacts every day. It can take hours to craft a custom version of my resume and cover letter to hit all the right points a company has put in its job description. And whatever I write has to get through automatic screening programs that look for keywords before they are ever get into human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work to nearly midnight, seven days a week, to reach as many people as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3215602.1460551505!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/job-application-resume-workforce-labour-surey.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Wimsett says the application process always goes well until he's face-to-face with an interviewer. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not having a job takes much more than a financial toll. It causes me deep emotional distress. It is highly embarrassing. I don't talk to anyone about it. It can sometimes take me half the night to fall asleep while my mind runs over my situation and I search for options. When I do doze off, I sleep for nine or more hours. I question my worth and abilities. The stress is unrelenting.  It affects my blood pressure, my heart and my digestion. My usual disposition is positive, but I have felt the smothering claws of depression on more than one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my twenties I went through a divorce, at which time I took sole custody of my six-year-old son and raised him on my own. I entered the computer industry. The pay was good and the work steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now 64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>David Wimsett's resume is expansive, and potential employers are always keen to meet with him. When they finally do, however, the interviewer's disposition quickly switches from enthusiastic to disappointed.</og:description>

<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Hey HN,
&lt;p&gt;I'm a seasoned backend developer and systems administrator, with over 10 years of full-time programming experience. I've worked with anything from Assembly, C, Rust all the way to Python, Erlang, Elixir, PHP, Haskell, Lisp, Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to frontend, I have used React, Vue.js, ReasonML, Clojurescript and Elm extensively, and I know my way around web technologies in general. However, ever since I first started programming, I was NEVER able to get the gist behind CSS. I can't center my divs properly. I can't say &quot;hey, CSS, this is the parent div, and all child divs must obey its size&quot;. I can't do anything basic on CSS without turning for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, but very likely related, I always failed to have any glimpse into how design works. I have no idea which colors &quot;go&quot; with which ones, and pretty much all fonts look like the same for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know the experience from fellow programmers. Is CSS an &quot;art&quot; thing? Is it common for other developers to have issues with it, or is it just me? Is there any material out there that made CSS &quot;click&quot; for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing desks have become incredibly popular, and for good reason. Sitting for long periods of time can have long-term effects on your health, so if you work at a computer each day, the ability to stand and work is extremely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IKEA Bekant standing desk is a popular option, but it lacks memory positions. One Tindarian set out to fix this problem by creating a replacement controller, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tindie.com/products/15639&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Megadesk was born&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This AVR-based, open source drop-in controller give any IKEA Bekant standing desk the ability to move your choice of preset heights. This controller will allow you to create as many as ten memorized positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Megadesk targets the factory enclosure so it maintains the original look look and feel of the desk design. Assembly instructions are available on the product page, along with a guide on how to program unique positions into the controller’s memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re sitting or standing, this handy controller will ensure the desk sits at a height that keeps you comfortable throughout the work day.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Day I Fell in Love with Fuzzing</title>
<link>https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/01/25/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/01/25/</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-01-25&quot;&gt;January 25, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;nullprogram.com/blog/2019/01/25/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007 I wrote a pair of modding tools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/binitools&quot;&gt;binitools&lt;/a&gt;, for a space trading and combat simulation game named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freelancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The game stores its non-art assets in the format of “binary INI” files, or “BINI” files. The motivation for the binary format over traditional INI files was probably performance: it’s faster to load and read these files than it is to parse arbitrary text in INI format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the in-game content can be changed simply by modifying these files — changing time names, editing commodity prices, tweaking ship statistics, or even adding new ships to the game. The binary nature makes them unsuitable to in-place modification, so the natural approach is to convert them to text INI files, make the desired modifications using a text editor, then convert back to the BINI format and replace the file in the game’s installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t reverse engineer the BINI format, nor was I the first person the create tools to edit them. The existing tools weren’t to my tastes, and I had my own vision for how they should work — an interface more closely following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/&quot;&gt;the Unix tradition&lt;/a&gt; despite the target being a Windows game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got started, I had just learned how to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/yacc.html&quot;&gt;yacc&lt;/a&gt; (really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/&quot;&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/lex.html&quot;&gt;lex&lt;/a&gt; (really &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/westes/flex&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Autoconf, so I went all-in with these newly-discovered tools. It was exciting to try them out in a real-world situation, though I slavishly aped the practices of other open source projects without really understanding why things were they way they were. Due to the use of yacc/lex and the configure script build, compiling the project required a full, Unix-like environment. This is all visible in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/binitools/tree/original&quot;&gt;the original version of the source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was moderately successful in two ways. First, I was able to use the tools to modify the game. Second, other people were using the tools, since the binaries I built show up in various collections of Freelancer modding tools online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rewrite&quot;&gt;The Rewrite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the way things were until mid-2018 when I revisited the project. Ever look at your own old code and wonder what they heck you were thinking? My INI format was far more rigid and strict than necessary, I was doing questionable things when writing out binary data, and the build wasn’t even working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an additional decade of experience under my belt, I knew I could do &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better if I were to rewrite these tools today. So, over the course of a few days, I did, from scratch. That’s what’s visible in the master branch today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/03/30/&quot;&gt;I like to keep things simple&lt;/a&gt; which meant no more Autoconf, and instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/20/&quot;&gt;a simple, portable Makefile&lt;/a&gt;. No more yacc or lex, and instead a hand-coded parser. Using only conforming, portable C. The result was so simple that I can &lt;a href=&quot;https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/06/13/&quot;&gt;build using Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; in a single, short command, so the Makefile isn’t all that necessary. With one small tweak (replace &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stdint.h&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;), I can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/04/13/&quot;&gt;build and run binitools in DOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version is faster, leaner, cleaner, and simpler. It’s far more flexible about its INI input, so its easier to use. But is it more correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fuzzing&quot;&gt;Fuzzing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/what-the-fuzz/&quot;&gt;fuzzing&lt;/a&gt; for years, especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/&quot;&gt;american fuzzy lop&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;afl&lt;/em&gt;. However, I wasn’t having success with it. I’d fuzz some of the tools I use regularly, and it wouldn’t find anything of note, at least not before I gave up. I fuzzed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/pdjson&quot;&gt;my JSON library&lt;/a&gt;, and somehow it turned up nothing. Surely my JSON parser couldn’t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; robust already, could it? Fuzzing just wasn’t accomplishing anything for me. (As it turns out, my JSON library &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; quite robust, thanks in large part to various contributors!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve got this relatively new INI parser, and while it can successfully parse and correctly re-assemble the game’s original set of BINI files, it hasn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; been exercised that much. Surely there’s something in here for a fuzzer to find. Plus I don’t even have to write a line of code in order to run afl against it. The tools already read from standard input by default, which is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you’ve got the necessary tools installed (make, gcc, afl), here’s how easy it is to start fuzzing binitools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make CC=afl-gcc
$ mkdir in out
$ echo '[x]' &amp;gt; in/empty
$ afl-fuzz -i in -o out -- ./bini
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bini&lt;/code&gt; utility takes INI as input and produces BINI as output, so it’s far more interesting to fuzz than its inverse, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unbini&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unbini&lt;/code&gt; parses relatively simple binary data, there are (probably) no bugs for the fuzzer to find. I did try anyway just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nullprogram.com/img/screenshot/afl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my example above, I swapped out the default compiler for afl’s GCC wrapper (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CC=afl-gcc&lt;/code&gt;). It calls GCC in the background, but in doing so adds its own instrumentation to the binary. When fuzzing, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;afl-fuzz&lt;/code&gt; uses that instrumentation to monitor the program’s execution path. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt&quot;&gt;afl whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; explains the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created input and output directories, placing a minimal, working example into the input directory, which gives afl a starting point. As afl runs, it mutates a queue of inputs and observes the changes on the program’s execution. The output directory contains the results and, more importantly, a corpus of inputs that cause unique execution paths. In other words, the fuzzer output will be lots of inputs that exercise many different edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most exciting and dreaded result is a crash. The first time I ran it against binitools, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bini&lt;/code&gt; had &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; such crashes. Within minutes, afl was finding a number of subtle and interesting bugs in my program, which was &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; useful. It even discovered an unlikely &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/binitools/commit/b695aec7d0021299cbd83c8c6983055f16d11507&quot;&gt;stale pointer bug&lt;/a&gt; by exercising different orderings for various memory allocations. This particular bug was the turning point that made me realize the value of fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the bugs it found led to crashes. I also combed through the outputs to see what sorts of inputs were succeeding, what was failing, and observe how my program handled various edge cases. It was rejecting some inputs I thought should be valid, accepting some I thought should be invalid, and interpreting some in ways I hadn’t intended. So even after I fixed the crashing inputs, I still made tweaks to the parser to fix each of these troublesome inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-test-suite&quot;&gt;Building a test suite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I combed out all the fuzzer-discovered bugs, and I agreed with the parser on how all the various edge cases should be handled, I turned the fuzzer’s corpus into a test suite — though not directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had run the fuzzer in parallel — a process that is explained in the afl documentation — so I had lots of redundant inputs. By redundant I mean that the inputs are different but have the same execution path. Fortunately afl has a tool to deal with this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;afl-cmin&lt;/code&gt;, the corpus minimization tool. It eliminates all the redundant inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, many of these inputs were longer than necessary in order to invoke their unique execution path. There’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;afl-tmin&lt;/code&gt;, the test case minimizer, which I used to further shrink my test corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sorted the valid from invalid inputs and checked them into the repository. Have a look at all the wacky inputs &lt;a href=&quot;https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.html&quot;&gt;invented by&lt;/a&gt; the fuzzer starting from my single, minimal input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially locks down the parser, and the test suite ensures a particular build behaves in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; specific way. This is most useful for ensuring that builds on other platforms and by other compilers are indeed behaving identically with respect to their outputs. My test suite even revealed a bug in diet libc, as binitools doesn’t pass the tests when linked against it. If I were to make non-trivial changes to the parser, I’d essentially need to scrap the current test suite and start over, having afl generate an entire new corpus for the new parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuzzing has certainly proven itself to be a powerful technique. It found a number of bugs that I likely wouldn’t have otherwise discovered on my own. I’ve since gotten more savvy on its use and have used it on other software — not just software I’ve written myself — and discovered more bugs. It’s got a permanent slot on my software developer toolbelt.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Standard and Clean Series A Term Sheet</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While working with companies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/series-a/&quot;&gt;YC’s Series A program&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve noticed a common problem: founders don’t know what “good” looks like in a term sheet. This makes sense, because it is often, literally, the first time in their careers that they’ve seen one. This puts founders at a significant disadvantage because VCs see term sheets all the time and know what to expect. Because we’ve invested in so many founders over the years and have seen hundreds of Series A term sheets, we know what “good” looks like. We work with our founders to understand where terms diverge from “good”, what they can do about that divergence, and when and how it makes sense to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is what a Series A term sheet looks like with standard and clean terms from a good Silicon Valley VC. Bracketed items (besides the names of the company and lead investor) are always or frequently negotiated. Items not in brackets are sometimes negotiated, but this has more to do with the idiosyncratic features of the company or the situation, and generally aren’t terms that parties intend to heavily bargain over during the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the critical things you’ll notice is that we didn’t put in standard pricing. While the lead in a Series A round generally wants 20% of the company, pricing can flex up and down depending on the leverage held by each side. We think price is an important term, but too specific to each raise to try to create a standard. We’re more concerned with terms around control and structure that are less familiar to founders, and therefore more prone to cause confusion and trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this term sheet doesn’t belong to any particular VC — we drafted it — but it does substantively reflect what we see most often. Founders with a lot of negotiating leverage can sometimes do better, and the converse is true too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising to see everything covered in a single page. This wasn’t always the case, but became common over the last decade as some investors decided to make their term sheets more user friendly by shortening the legalese as if to say, “We aren’t going to get bogged down in the minutiae. We’re going to make this easy, friendly, standard and fast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the most important thing to understand about the term sheet: it’s another way in which your Series A investor might be telling you something. A contract allocates risks between the parties, so the terms the investor insists on can sometimes say a lot about the investor’s perceived risks. These perceived risks show up in a couple of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first way relates to control terms. We don’t mean the set of investor vetoes in the “Voting Rights” section, which are pretty standard fare, but rather issues of board composition and the investor’s ability to block or dictate operational decisions made by the board. The board structure in this term sheet is founder-friendly because the founders retain board control 2-1. The way in which founders most often lose control at the Series A is with a 2-2-1 board structure, i.e. 2 founders, 2 investors and an independent board member. The loss of board control is most significant because it means the founders can be fired from their own company. Another way in which founders lose some control is a term that doesn’t appear in the standard example above, which is a separate provision that says the investor director’s approval is required for operational decisions like setting the annual budget, hiring/firing executives, pivoting the business, adding new lines of business, etc. When boards are set up to take power away from founders, the investor’s outward justification will frequently be reasons of governance or accountability. But the more power that’s taken away, the more it’s undeniable that the investor is attempting to structure away a perceived risk. So when an investor says that they’re committed to partnering with you for the long-term – or that they’re betting everything on you – but then tells you something else with the terms that they insist on, believe the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way perceived risks manifest is if a term sheet includes non-standard or “dirty” economic terms. Here, the term sheet example is instructive not for what it contains but what it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt;. Examples of such terms would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liquidation preference greater than 1x — the investor gets back more than its invested capital first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participating preferred — the investor double-dips by getting its money back plus its pro rata portion of exit proceeds, rather than choosing between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cumulative dividends — the investor compounds its liquidation preference every year by X%, which increases the economic hurdle that has to be cleared before founders and employees see any value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warrant coverage — the investor gets extra fully diluted ownership without paying for it at the agreed upon valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all ways of adding structure to reduce typical venture risk, either directly by boosting the investor’s downside economics, or indirectly by juicing the upside outcomes. The investor is essentially saying, “I’m sort of afraid of losing my money.” It can also foreshadow how they might behave when things aren’t going well, such as pushing you to sell when you don’t want to, or dial back risk when it’s important to take it. Good investors would rather address economic risks by negotiating valuation, and are otherwise happy to give standard terms because they know that the real money in venture is not made with structure, but by building long-term value, which they are confident in their ability to help you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing to remember is that your Series A documents are a foundation and precedent for the terms of future rounds. Good foundations make the next term sheet and financing round fast and simple, as future investors just step into the same straightforward terms. Doing the opposite complicates future fundraises, such as future investors asking for the same structure-heavy terms, existing investors refusing to drop terms that subsequent investors want removed as a precondition of investing, etc. Unwinding bad terms is difficult, and oftentimes impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the point is to get a clean deal, not to cycle a lot to get the perfect deal. No one ever built an enduring company just by winning their Series A negotiation. Also, even if you can’t get everything right or the way you want it, you always have the power to execute. If you do that, the value you build can outrun suboptimal terms or establish leverage to renegotiate later. So don’t lose sight of the ultimate goal: closing fast and getting back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Some great investors still send longer term sheets, but this has more to do with their preference for going a bit deeper into the details at this stage, rather than deferring this until the definitive documents. The definitive documents are derived from the term sheet and are the much longer (100+ pages) binding contracts that everyone signs and closes on. It’s common to negotiate a few additional points at this stage, though deviation from anything explicitly addressed in the term sheet is definitely re-trading. Also, in a few places, this term sheet refers to certain terms as being “standard.” That may seem vague and circular, but term sheets frequently do describe certain terms that way. What that really means is that there’s an accepted practice of what appears in the docs for these terms among the lawyers who specialize in startups and venture deals, so make sure your lawyer (and the investor’s lawyer) fit that description.&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/#footnoteid1&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The two most impactful investor vetoes in this section are the veto on a financing, which is covered by clauses (ii) and (iii), and the veto on a sale of the company, which is in clause (vii). We point these out because the concrete implications of these clauses aren’t facially obvious, and because most term sheets use similar technical jargon for these vetoes.&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/#footnoteid2&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The founders implicitly control those 2 seats because they’re designated by a majority of common, and founders generally control a majority of common for a long time. In even more founder-friendly term sheets, those 2 seats may be designated by the founders themselves (as individuals).&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/#footnoteid3&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whether being fired from the company as an employee also triggers the removal of the founder from the board is a separate question and depends on what was negotiated in the financing documents. Sometimes a founder’s right to vote her shares to appoint a director will be conditioned on the founder being currently employed by the company. Whenever conditions are attached to your rights to vote on anything, make sure to ask your lawyer to walk you through the various scenarios in which those conditions matter and how they can hurt you.&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-standard-and-clean-series-a-term-sheet/#footnoteid4&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not legal advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Carolynn Levy, Jon Levy, and Nicole Cadman for their comments on this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dropbox buys HelloSign (YC W11) for $230M</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; announced today that it intends to purchase &lt;a href=&quot;http://hellosign.com&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, a company that provides lightweight document workflow and e-signature services. The company paid a hefty $230 million for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/dropbox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox’s&lt;/a&gt; SVP of engineering, Quentin Clark, sees this as more than simply bolting on electronic signature functionality to the Dropbox solution. For him, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/hellosign-moves-into-forms-based-workflow-with-new-helloworks-product/&quot;&gt;the workflow capabilities&lt;/a&gt; that HelloSign added in 2017 were really key to the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“W&lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;hat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt; about HelloSign&lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;that the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;investment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;they’ve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;made in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;APIs and the workflow products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;aligned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;long-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;direction,” Clark told TechCrunch. “It’s not just a thing to do one more activity with Dropbox, it’s really going to help us pursue that broader vision,” he added. That vision involves extending the storage capabilities that is at the core of the Dropbox solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can also been seen in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/dropbox-introduces-extensions-for-deeper-integration-with-third-party-tools/&quot;&gt;the Extension capability&lt;/a&gt; that Dropbox added last year. HelloSign was actually one of the companies involved at launch. While Clark says the company will continue to encourage companies to extend the Dropbox solution, today’s acquisition gives it a capability of its own that doesn’t require a partnership and already is connected to Dropbox via Extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been following this market for many years, says the fact it’s an Extensions partner should allow much faster integration than would happen normally in an acquisition like this. “Simple document processes that relate to small and medium business are still largely manual. The fact that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/hellosign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;hellosign&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt; has solutions for things like real estate, insurance and customer/employee on boarding, plus the existing extension to Dropbox, means it can be leveraged quickly for revenue growth by Dropbox, Pelz-Sharpe explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the size of the deal shows there is high demand for these kinds capabilities. “It is a very high multiple, but in such a fast growth area not an unreasonable one to demand for a startup showing such growth potential. The price suggests that there were almost certainly other highly motivated bidders for the deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HelloSign CEO Joseph Walla says being part of Dropbox gives HelloSign access to resources of a much larger public company, which should allow it to reach a broader market than it could on its own. “Together with Dropbox, we can bring more seamless document workflows to even more customers and dramatically accelerate our impact,” Walla said in a blog post announcing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HelloSign remains standalone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney Bouck, COO at HelloSign, who previously held stints at Box and EMC Documentum, said the company will remain an independent entity. That means it will continue to operate with its current management structure as part of the Dropbox family. In fact, Clark indicated that all of the HelloSign employees will be offered employment at Dropbox as part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to remain effectively a standalone business within the Dropbox family, so that we can continue to focus on developing the great products that we have and delivering value. So the good news is that our customers won’t really experience any massive change. They just get more opportunity,” Bouck said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Lepofsky, an analyst at Constellation Research who specializes in enterprise workflow, sees HelloSign giving Dropbox an enterprise-class workflow tool, but adds that the addition of Bouck and her background in enterprise content management is also a nice bonus for Dropbox in this deal. “While this is not an acqui-hire, Dropbox does end up with Whitney Bouck, a proven leader in expanding offerings into enterprise scale accounts. I believe she could have a large impact in Dropbox’s battle with her former employer Box,” Lepofsky told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark said that it was too soon to say exactly how it will bundle and incorporate HelloSign functionality beyond the Extensions. But he expects that the company will find a way to integrate the two products where it make sense, even while HelloSign operates as a separate company with its own customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you consider that HelloSign, a Bay Area startup that launched in 2011, raised just $16 million, it appears to be an impressive return for investors and a solid exit for the company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
