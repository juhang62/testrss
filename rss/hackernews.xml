&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f00c&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;In the last few years, you’ve likely seen a fair few comments about monopolies in the tech industry, and suggestions for breaking them up. These comments usually revolve around the big FAANG companies (or at least, Google, Amazon and Facebook) and suggest the power they hold is unhealthy for society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1c72&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;And they’re right. It is unhealthy, and definitely acts as a good reason to break up said companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ba00&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;But they’re not the only ones that need it, nor the most important cases. No, there are two others that are far more dangerous to the internet, businesses and society right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;56fd&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Namely, the payment processing companies, like Visa and MasterCard. These companies handle billions of credit card transactions a day, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-mastercard-stocks/swiping-their-way-higher-visa-mastercard-could-be-the-next-1-trillion-companies-idUSKBN1ZU0JA&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;have a level of power the likes of Google can only dream of.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As Reuters points out, their marketshare for credit cards is about what Google and Apple’s is for mobile OSes
&lt;p id=&quot;0554&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Like almost complete control over what can be sold online. Ever wonder why certain things are difficult to buy via PayPal or other similar systems? Why Patreon ban certain types of creators really easily? Why adult sites find it so tough to process card payments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;42ac&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Because these guys set the rules, and those rules ban a lot of content that’s either offensive or brings high risk of fraud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/payment-processors-are-still-policing-your-sex-life&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s why adult sites usually keep switching payment processors, or running ads from less than savoury networks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a19a&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;So you’ve got a huge part of the monetary system controlled by parties with zero interest in neutrality, and power beyond government control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c0b3&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;What’s more, abuse of this power has already happened. B&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/visa-mastercard-move-to-choke-wikileaks/&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;ack in 2010, Visa cut off access to WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the site unable to receive donations as a result. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2012/07/13/wikileaks_visa_victory/&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;This was fortunately then overturned (by a Dutch court order no less),&lt;/a&gt; but it’s a scary precedent regardless, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LABasedComedian/status/1277009113659043840&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;shows just how easily ‘undesirable’ media outlets and creators can be deprived of their income by companies like this one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8025&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;And that’s not the only issue they bring either. No, their control over the system means outages are very serious indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9097&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/jun/01/visa-outage-payment-chaos-after-card-network-crashes-live-updates&quot; class=&quot;bw fd gi gj gk gl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Just think back to the UK in June 2018, when Visa went down across the country.&lt;/a&gt; That caused a huge incident that took thousands of businesses and millions of credit cards offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d00b&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Which in turn likely caused billions of dollars in economic losses, all due to a simple network accident. One small issue, whole economies on the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cc85&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;And it could potentially have been even worse. Had their few competitors also gone down, literally all electronic payments would have broken at once. Had it been a worldwide issue, and basically the entire world economy would be unusable for hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;618d&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;This in turn also means it’s a perfect target for malicious enemy forces. Theoretically like Iran, North Korea, etc. All of whom have a vested interest in their rivals losing some of their technological advantages over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;357e&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;So there’s a potential cybersecurity disaster waiting to happen there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e34&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Though it’s not as if our governments likely aren’t using these companies and systems for questionable purposes as is. They’re a perfect way to target and cripple regimes we don’t like at this point in time, and would almost certainly be cut off in the case of a war or major conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1481&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Hence neither group really has reason to trust them. They’re dangerous for our own societies, dangerous for our opponents and a huge security risk regardless of the situation, plus a force for censoring people who’ve done nothing other than annoyed the ‘wrong’ people overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;268a&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;But surprisingly, they’re not worth breaking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7925&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;And I know what you’ll say. That I made a perfectly good argument for doing just that. That with all those downsides, breaking up Visa and MasterCard (and perhaps some competitors) is the best way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ec82&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;However, here’s the thing. It’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5992&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Since at the end of the day, the problem isn’t just that these companies are too big, it’s that their industry has been left entirely privatised at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dee9&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Cause payment processing for individuals and businesses isn’t a competitive market. It’s not some ‘optional’ product the world can exist without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;593a&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;It’s a crucial part of a large chunk of the world’s businesses. It’s crucial for the internet to function, and it’s absence makes it incredibly difficult to live in a modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2a0e&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Hence the solution isn’t just more competition. It’s to regulate the whole industry as utilities, or even turn it into neutral, global infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ab58&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;This would mean that in the same way everyone has access to water, electricity, or public transport, everyone has access to payment processing, regardless of their nationality, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political views, wealth or anything else. Reactions to people asking to cut people off from receiving money should be treated like an attempt to say, remove a police station’s access to water or electricity; called absurd and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8f28&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;It’s time we called it a day for the large payment processing companies, and regulated their entire market as utilities like people are expecting us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b00e&quot; class=&quot;fp fq cd fr b fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh cv ap&quot;&gt;Otherwise, individuals, organisations and businesses alike will suffer their ridiculous rules and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why we won’t be supporting Sign in with Apple</title>
<link>https://blog.anylist.com/2020/06/sign-in-with-apple/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.anylist.com/2020/06/sign-in-with-apple/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting June 30th, Apple will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03262020b&quot;&gt;enforcing a new rule&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store requiring many apps to support Sign in with Apple. AnyList is one of the apps affected by this new rule, which means that we must either implement Sign in with Apple or make other changes to our app. After considering the merits of Sign in with Apple, we have decided not to support it. We understand that this may surprise some of our customers, so we’d like to explain in detail why we made this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party login systems like Sign in with Apple cause many user experience and customer support headaches. People don’t remember which login system they used to create their account. (&lt;em&gt;“Hmm, I created this account a couple of years ago. Did I use my email address? Facebook account? Sign in with Apple?”&lt;/em&gt;) Simple questions like, &lt;em&gt;“How do I reset my password?”&lt;/em&gt; no longer have simple answers and depend on which system you used to create your account, if you can remember. And if you get locked out of your account and used a third-party login system, we may not be able to help you ourselves and will instead have to direct you to another company, with all of the hassles that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these customer experience problems that are common to all third-party login systems, Sign in with Apple introduces several more that are unique to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is that most Apple IDs are tied to an iCloud email address. So most accounts created via Sign in with Apple will use an iCloud email address. But many of those iCloud email addresses are unused and unchecked, because a customer’s “real” email account is their Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail account. If we try to contact a customer using their iCloud email address, they may never see our message. We used to run into this problem constantly with customer support, back when AnyList used the built-in iOS email compose interface for sending support requests. This interface often defaults to using an iCloud email account. So people would ask for help, we’d reply, and they’d contact us again later, angry that we never replied. Our reply was going to their iCloud email account, but they didn’t see it because they only ever looked at their Gmail account, in the Gmail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is Sign in with Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425&quot;&gt;“Hide My Email”&lt;/a&gt; feature. With this feature, if you create an account with us, Apple will generate a special email address just for that account. So rather than your email address being &lt;em&gt;john.doe@icloud.com&lt;/em&gt;, we will see your email address as something like &lt;em&gt;dpdcnf87nu@privaterelay.appleid.com&lt;/em&gt;. While this is an intriguing idea that provides a measure of privacy, in practice it creates numerous support and user experience headaches. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;14.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a customer contacts us asking for support, and we need to look up something in their account, typically we can just ask them for the email address on their account. But with “Hide My Email” that wouldn’t be easily possible, because the customer would have to figure out the &lt;em&gt;privaterelay.appleid.com&lt;/em&gt; email address used for their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if there are platforms where AnyList doesn’t support Sign in with Apple, like Android, and someone wants to log into their account, they’d have to know their &lt;em&gt;privaterelay.appleid.com&lt;/em&gt; email address. (And that certainly won’t be easy to find if you no longer have an iOS device.) And then they’d have to create a password with us, since they wouldn’t be able to sign in using Sign in with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for a service like AnyList, which is heavily focused on sharing lists with other people, the “Hide My Email” option greatly complicates collaboration. Typically, customers share a list by typing in the email address of the person they want to share with. If that person already has an account, the list is instantly shared. But with the “Hide My Email” option, your spouse or friends obviously won’t know your &lt;em&gt;privaterelay.appleid.com&lt;/em&gt; email address, so when they enter your email address, our systems will believe that you don’t have an account. At that point, you’ll get an email from us asking you to create an account. If you accidentally create a new account, it won’t include the work you’ve done in your existing account created via Sign in with Apple. And if you manage not to make that mistake, then there would be a link between your email address and the account you created with Sign in with Apple, negating the value of hiding your email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agree with Apple that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/&quot;&gt;privacy is a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;, and understand that the “Hide My Email” option in Sign in with Apple is well-intentioned, but it feels like Apple didn’t really think through all of the implications for basic user experience, customer support, and collaboration. At AnyList, we respect your privacy. We’re a small company that makes money when people like our app and pay for it. We do not make money with creepy tracking or by selling your information. When you provide us with your email address, it is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; sold, shared, or used to invade your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond customer experience, there are also many problems that Sign in with Apple creates for us as developers, which has knock-on effects for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, implementing support for third-party login systems like Sign in with Apple significantly increases the complexity of handling user accounts in our systems. Instead of having one system for common operations like creating an account and signing in, supporting third-party login systems can quickly turn account management code into a rat’s nest, with special logic necessary to handle each different login system. This is especially true when supporting multiple third-party login systems (e.g., Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, etc.). This makes maintenance more difficult and error-prone, and if there’s any place where you cannot afford to have any errors, it’s in security-critical code like account management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also time consuming to implement support for a new third-party login system, particularly for a small company like ours that supports our app on multiple platforms. It’s not enough for us to add Sign in with Apple to our iOS app. We also have to add it to our web app, Mac app, and Android app. (Creating even more complexity, Apple does not provide any real solution for supporting Sign in with Apple on Android, see below.) So if we choose to support Sign in with Apple, that means that we have to spend a significant amount of time to get it working everywhere, rather than spending that time improving the core list, recipe, and meal planning functionality of our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers, we always have to do our due-diligence in evaluating the security implications of our work. In the last month a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/&quot;&gt;massive security flaw&lt;/a&gt; was reported in Sign in with Apple, so serious that Apple paid $100,000 to the person who found it. If you read the linked report, you’ll see that this serious flaw was also very simple, which doesn’t provide a lot of confidence. For something as critical as a service for &lt;em&gt;logging into accounts&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn’t seem wise to use an immature service (less than a year old) that has recently been the subject of a serious security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sign of Sign in with Apple’s immaturity is the sad state of the documentation for it. Good documentation is critical to facilitating developer adoption of any service. Since Apple is expecting developers to adopt this service by June 30th, it seems reasonable to expect decent documentation. Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/05/20/the-state-of-apples-developer-documentation/&quot;&gt;like most of Apple’s recent developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;, it’s sorely lacking. For example, Apple vaguely states that you can implement Sign in with Apple on Android, but there is no direct documentation on how to do it. We understand that Apple probably doesn’t care much for Android, but if they are going to provide a login system, and are going to force developers of multi-platform apps to adopt it, then providing no real support for a major platform that these multi-platform apps run on is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, from a policy perspective, Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/&quot;&gt;explicitly states in their usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, “Apple reserves the right to disable Sign in with Apple on a website or app for any reason at any time.” If customers cannot log into their accounts, then they can’t use our service. Giving a third-party such powerful control over a core part of our service when it’s not &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; required is unnecessarily risky, in our view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-facebook-login&quot;&gt;What about Facebook Login?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, you may be thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You have a point, but I use AnyList and it offers to let me sign in with Facebook. Doesn’t it suffer from many similar problems?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Anyway, don’t the new App Store Review Guidelines require you to support Sign in with Apple, since you offer Facebook as a sign in option?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are both excellent points, and it’s absolutely true that some of the arguments above apply to creating an account via Facebook. That’s why we’re also announcing that we’ll be removing Facebook Login from AnyList. Our support for signing up using Facebook was begrudgingly added years ago as an experiment in offering another signup option, but we were never enthusiastic about it. That’s become even more true as time goes on, since Facebook constantly seems to be upping the ante with creepy privacy practices. We use the Facebook SDK to provide login functionality, and every new release of the SDK seems to add new tracking options that are turned on by default, which we have to take action to disable. Furthermore, the Facebook SDK has quality problems, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250689/facebook-sdk-bug-ios-app-crash-apple-spotify-venmo-tiktok-tinder&quot;&gt;recently caused a huge number of iOS apps to crash&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfigured server. You can expect to see an AnyList app update soon that removes Facebook Login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this post has helped to explain why we won’t be supporting Sign in with Apple. We’d love to hear your feedback on this post. If you have any comments or questions, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anylist.com/contact&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube bans Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, Richard Spencer for hate speech</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307303/youtube-bans-molyneux-duke-richard-spencer-conduct-hate-speech</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307303/youtube-bans-molyneux-duke-richard-spencer-conduct-hate-speech</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;RCf8r4&quot;&gt;YouTube has banned several prominent white supremacist channels, including those belonging to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux&quot;&gt;Stefan Molyneux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-duke&quot;&gt;David Duke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0&quot;&gt;Richard Spencer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ezRh9l&quot;&gt;Other channels banned include American Renaissance (with its associated channel AmRen Podcasts) and the channel for Spencer’s National Policy Institute. The channels repeatedly violated YouTube’s policies, a YouTube spokesperson said, by alleging that members of protected groups were inferior. These come alongside other violations that led to YouTube taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tHnVY9&quot;&gt;“We have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube, and terminate any channel that repeatedly or egregiously violates those policies,” a YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “After updating our guidelines to better address supremacist content, we saw a 5x spike in video removals and have terminated over 25,000 channels for violating our hate speech policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;FN7gPI&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OZ1HGS&quot;&gt;YouTube began cracking down on supremacist channels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652576/youtube-supremacist-content-ban-borderline-extremist-terms-of-service&quot;&gt;in June 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The company issued updated rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/06/our-ongoing-work-to-tackle-hate.html&quot;&gt;prohibiting&lt;/a&gt; “videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.” Channels that repeatedly brush up against this type of content but don’t cross the line will receive other penalties, including losing access to YouTube’s Partner Program and not being able to monetize their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SOf45q&quot;&gt;A number of the creators affected have already started tweeting about their bans. Spencer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/1277668296943210496&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he will “appeal the suspension” and called the ban a “systemic, coordinated effort.” Molyneux &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/1277665653000986625&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube “just suspended the largest philosophy conversation the world has ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k1LcqA&quot;&gt;YouTube’s ban of the six channels comes after Reddit banned a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules&quot;&gt;high-profile and controversial subreddits&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, including r/The_Donald, and Twitch temporarily banned President Donald Trump for hateful conduct over comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account&quot;&gt;made in two different streams&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube has faced pressure from critics for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/forget-facebook-youtube-videos-are-radicalizing-millions-young-people-company-ncna916341&quot;&gt;years to remove Molyneux’s channel&lt;/a&gt;. Molyneux was banned by Mailchimp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/stefan-molyneux-mailchimp/&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reddit shuts down subreddits including r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.503105590062&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The move by Reddit comes amid a broader crackdown by technology companies, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/27/twitter-adds-labels-tweets-that-break-its-rules-putting-president-trump-companys-crosshairs/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/26/facebook-hate-speech-policies/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, to try to rein in hateful, deceptive and other problematic content on their platforms, typically after high-profile scandals prompted action. Reddit also implemented its first policy banning hate speech on Monday and closed about 2,000 individual forums, what the company calls “subreddits.” The company already had a policy against “divisive language” in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Most of the closed subreddits already had become dormant while others, like r/The_Donald, had histories of policy violations. Reddit also closed the left-wing r/ChapoTrapHouse on Monday for violating platform rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Chief executive Steve Huffman, who also is a co-founder of the site, said in announcing the move against r/The_Donald: “All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;In a call with reporters, he added that the decision to close r/The_Donald and other politically themed subreddits was “absolutely not” related to the views aired on them. Numerous conservative forums remain active, and some liberal ones also were closed on Monday for policy violations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;“It’s one of the founding principles of Reddit to foster [political] discussion,” Huffman said in the call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The company’s general counsel, Benjamin Lee, said in the same call, “There’s a home on Reddit for supporters of Donald Trump. … We’re not the ones who shut down the community. The moderators are the ones who shut down that community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;In addition to r/The_Donald, the most active communities banned included r/darkhumorandmemes, r/chapotraphouse, r/darkjokecentral, r/gendercritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11.675675675676&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Reddit’s r/The_Donald was born in June 2015 as Trump began what was widely seen then as a long-shot bid for the presidency. Over the years, it was subjected to escalating disciplinary actions for violating Reddit content policies. Last year, the platform imposed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/26/pro-trump-message-board-quarantined-by-reddit-following-violent-threats/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“quarantine”&lt;/a&gt; that made the forum harder for Reddit users to access after what the company said at the time was months of “rule-breaking behavior.” Those violations included the “encouragement of violence toward police officers and public officials in Oregon” during a legislative dispute over climate legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;15.088607594937&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Reddit had previously taken steps to delete problematic content and limit the spread of popular posts after a series of embarrassing incidents, including early incubation of the false &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pizzagate conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt;, born in 2016, that alleged Democratic Party officials operated a child-sex ring out of a Washington pizzeria. Earlier that year, during his campaign for president, Trump hosted a freewheeling “Ask Me Anything” event, one of the signature features on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said that if supporters of the president want to hear his unfettered views, they should download his campaign app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The site to which many former users of r/The_Donald fled, called thedonald.win, celebrated the banning by Reddit Monday afternoon in a post titled, “This is How We Won,&quot; saying they expected the company to take action against them ahead of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;“They censored us, the suppressed us, they silenced us. We beat them,” said the post, voted to the top of the page. “With nothing but raw talent, and a patriotic drive to preserve our country, we escaped Silicon Valley censorship and created a new home out of nothing. No donors, no outside influences, just us and our message. And you came.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Earlier this month, co-founder and former Reddit board member Alexis Ohanian quit the company’s board, saying that he would use his Reddit stock to serve the black community and curb racial hate. He said he would start by donating $1 million to an organization founded by former NFL player Colin Kaepernick. He asked that Reddit fill his seat with a black board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;In announcing the decision, Ohanian, who is married to tennis superstar Serena Williams, appeared to reference Reddit’s hosting of hateful commentary. &quot;I’m saying this as a father who needs to be able to answer his black daughter when she asks: ‘What did you do?’,” he said on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;By the time Reddit formally closed r/The_Donald on Monday, it officially had 790,000 self-described “Patriots” who participated in what has been billed as “a never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump,” but there was little sign of recent activity. The most popular posts were several months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The lack of participation by moderators in the process of implementing new content policies proved decisive in the company’s decision to terminate it following years of violations and escalating disciplinary actions, Reddit officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The removal of the subreddit Monday seems likely to revive complaints by Trump and his supporters that Silicon Valley’s leading companies are biased against them and seek to limit the dissemination of their views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;12.996323529412&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;No systematic evidence of such claims has emerged, but Silicon Valley companies have faced pressure by Trump and conservative lawmakers to make changes to their platforms. At times, Facebook has overcorrected against those claims of bias by altering its newsfeed algorithm — which dictates what news billions of users see on their Facebook pages — to favor conservative publishers, and declining to remove spammy and abusive pages for fear that the move would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/20/facebook-republican-shift/?itid=lk_inline_manual_69&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_37&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disproportionately impact conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, according to Washington Post reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Now the company is facing a growing advertiser boycott over its refusal to remove a Trump post that many saw as encouraging violence during the George Floyd protests. Twitter hid the post with a warning label, noting that the post broke the company’s policies against encouraging violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Earlier this month, the Trump administration issued an executive order that called on the Federal Communications Commission to write new rules governing how social media sites can remove content from their sites while pushing the Federal Trade Commission to take action against companies engaging in “deceptive” acts of communication. The legality of the executive order is disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORRECTION:&lt;/strong&gt; A previous version of this story incorrectly described Alexis Ohanian as a former Reddit CEO. A company co-founder and a former board member, Ohanian was never CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The KDE community is moving to GitLab</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/06/29/welcome-kde/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/06/29/welcome-kde/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE community&lt;/a&gt; is #MovingToGitlab! After announcing the original decision to migrate to GitLab in November 2019, KDE has officially completed phase one of their migration, and contributors have begun to use GitLab on a daily basis at invent.kde.org. Read on to learn more about KDE's migration story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-kde&quot;&gt;About KDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE is an international community that creates open source software for desktops and mobile devices. KDE software is compatible with multiple platforms, including GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS, and Android. Their products are used by millions of home and office workers and are being deployed in schools around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 2,700 artists, designers, programmers, translators, writers, and other contributors from across the globe, the KDE community is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, this community creates and maintains more than 200 applications and countless add-ons, plugins, and Plasmoids, 1000+ repositories, 80+ frameworks for Qt developers, and more than 2,600 projects. KDE software is translated into more than 100 languages to enable vast global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-kde-moved-to-gitlab&quot;&gt;Why KDE moved to GitLab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adopting GitLab has been as a natural next step since the opportunity was presented. Simplifying the onboarding of new contributors is one of our main goals in the KDE community. Being able to allow project contributors to easily participate in how the products they maintain are tested and delivered will certainly be a turning point for our ecosystem,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://ev.kde.org/corporate/board/&quot;&gt;Aleix Pol&lt;/a&gt;, President of KDE e.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By using a platform offering an interface and workflow that most open source developers are nowadays familiar with, we are confident that we are lowering the bar for new contributors to join us, and are providing the foundation for our community to scale in the following years,&quot; added &lt;a href=&quot;https://ev.kde.org/corporate/board/&quot;&gt;Neofytos Kolokotronis&lt;/a&gt;, member of KDE e.V.'s Board of Directors and a core member of KDE's Onboarding team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to new tools is a lot of work for established communities like KDE. Migration decisions require careful communication and the complex task of gathering community consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KDE team made the decision to migrate after following a series of carefully designed steps. First, they talked to the sysadmin team and then formed a migration team to evaluate the move. Next, the sysadmin team completed a thorough study of GitLab's features and did an intake and comparison of the community's needs against those product features. Then, they created a process that allows KDE to run short test cycles with some projects, document the process, and provide feedback to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration started by moving some smaller and more agile KDE teams that were very interested in testing and providing feedback. After this cycle was completed successfully, KDE started migrating teams with a larger codebase and more contributors. Once all of the major issues were resolved, they made the final switch for all remaining projects they planned to move. The sysadmin team documented the results after each step and shared them directly with the KDE community to receive feedback and gather consensus on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the switch to GitLab fell directly under the scope of KDE's &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Streamlined_onboarding_of_new_contributors&quot;&gt;&quot;Streamlined Onboarding of New Contributors&quot; goal&lt;/a&gt;, the KDE Onboarding team was also involved from the start, working very closely with the sysadmin team, who were leading the effort. The community was involved in the decision-making from the beginning, and stayed up-to-date on each phase of the migration, and all questions and concerns were answered and addressed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was a major change for us, but we are very satisfied with how our community collaborated over long discussion threads. We believe that by working together we made the best decisions as we moved forward,&quot; says Neofytos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;migration-challenges-and-solutions&quot;&gt;Migration challenges and solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for KDE was the sheer volume of data they were dealing with and how it was integrated into the numerous tools in use (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/&quot;&gt;Phabricator&lt;/a&gt;). With more than 1,000 repositories, this migration was a big undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, KDE decided to approach the migration in phases rather than do it all at once. By phasing the migration, they were able to deal with different data types, such as repositories and tasks, separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE developed custom tools to make bulk updates easier throughout the migration process. These tools help set the name, description, and avatar of the projects alongside a number of settings, for example, protected branches, and merge methods. By using these custom tools for bulk updates, KDE was also able to avoid granting maintainer access to individual contributors. KDE only allows maintainer access for sysadmins per their access and permissions policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE ported custom Git hooks to ensure that certain checks and actions continued after the move to Gitlab. These include checks to ensure file encodings match KDE requirements and that bugs on their Bugzilla installation were closed as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to support their translation community, which still uses Subversion in their workflow, KDE also built tooling to export SSH keys from GitLab to avoid the need to update these in two places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE also adjusted the tools used to build and develop KDE software to make them compatible with the new repository structure in GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, KDE overcame most of their migration hurdles. Once the preparation work was finished to clean up a number of systems to work more natively with GitLab, the actual migration took about one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a few more challenges left before KDE can transition continuous integration (CI) and task management over to GitLab. To follow along with the KDE migration, you can take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26581&quot;&gt;list of issues that KDE is tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;architectural-decisions&quot;&gt;Architectural decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common challenge for organizations moving to GitLab is deciding how to structure their groups to best enable their community's workflows and allow them to abide by their policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE decided to tackle this challenge by setting up a series of groups at the top level of GitLab to act as categories. KDE's 1,200 repositories were then sorted into each of these categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE formed this architectural strategy to help make projects more discoverable. KDE wanted to avoid the impracticality of people needing to scroll endlessly through repositories. Setting up top-level categories also allows developers to get an easier overview of merge requests for the categories they are most interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to permissions, KDE uses a single master &quot;KDE Developers&quot; group to manage membership and permission levels. Everyone there is given &quot;Developer&quot; access. This group is then invited to all of the groups containing repositories except for the ones containing the KDE website and infrastructure repos. This method of dealing with permissions allows KDE to maintain a single source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gitlab--kde--️&quot;&gt;GitLab + KDE = ❤️&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/&quot;&gt;Community Edition&lt;/a&gt; of GitLab because of their commitment to open source. They are a member of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/&quot;&gt;GitLab for Open Source&lt;/a&gt; program, and have been actively collaborating with GitLab team members throughout the migration. One of benefits of using the GitLab for Open Source program for large migration efforts is that the community often offers some extra assistance through the evaluation period and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the GitLab for Open Source program has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24900&quot;&gt;public tracker for KDE's migration&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to communicate and better understand at a glance the issues that are especially important. This allows KDE, GitLab, and the larger open source community to collaborate on challenges together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;GitLab's values of &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration&quot;&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency&quot;&gt;transparency&lt;/a&gt; really shine through,&quot; says Neofytos. We appreciate their openness to accepting merge requests from community members and considering proposals for new features. We have had a great experience so far collaborating with members of the GitLab community and members of the GitLab team – from developers to program managers to product owners alike.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that phase one of the KDE migration is complete, we look forward to continuing to collaborate with KDE through the remaining phases of the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-the-kde-migration&quot;&gt;Summary of the KDE migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phase 1: Code hosting &amp;amp; review ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2: CI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 3: Task management for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-contribute-to-kde&quot;&gt;How to contribute to KDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE has an amazing community and they welcome new members! Existing members are happy to provide feedback on newcomers' contributions with the goal of helping them learn. Every day more and more people join the ever-growing KDE family – and there's always room for more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE has a rich infrastructure of web resources, forums, mailing-lists, IRC (chat), and many other ways to get in touch. To learn more about joining the KDE community, visit their &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved&quot;&gt;Get Involved&lt;/a&gt;&quot; page, which offers guidance to all contributors from all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India bans TikTok, WeChat, and dozens of other Chinese apps</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The Indian government on Monday evening &lt;a href=&quot;https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it was banning 59 apps developed by Chinese firms over concerns that these apps were engaging in activities that threatened “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India” in what is the latest standoff between the world’s two most populated nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the apps that India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT has ordered to ban include ByteDance’s &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;tiktok&quot;&gt;TikTok,&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/tiktok-education-edutok-india/&quot;&gt;counts India as its biggest overseas market&lt;/a&gt;; Community and Video Call apps from Xiaomi, which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/xiaomi-mi-samsung-india-smartphone-market/&quot;&gt;top smartphone vendor in India&lt;/a&gt;; two of Alibaba Group’s apps (UC Browser and UC News); Shareit; CM Browser, Club Factory, which claims to be India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/club-factory-raises-100m-to-expand-its-lifestyle-e-commerce-platform-in-india/&quot;&gt;third-largest e-commerce firm&lt;/a&gt;; and ES File Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that India, the world’s second largest internet market with nearly half of its 1.3 billion population online, has ordered to ban so many foreign apps. New Delhi said nation’s Computer Emergency Response Team had received many “representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2009609&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-2009609&quot; class=&quot;breakout wp-image-2009609&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;761&quot; height=&quot;915&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=250,300 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=768,923 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=566,680 566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=42,50 42w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-2009609&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The apps India is banning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarun Pathak, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint, said the order would impact roughly one in three smartphone users in India. TikTok, Club Factory and UC Browser and other apps put together had more than 500 million monthly active users in May, according to one of the top mobile insight firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, 27 of these 59 apps were among the top 1,000 Android apps in India last month, according to the mobile insights firm — data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what exactly the “ban” means and how mobile operating system makers and internet service providers are expected to comply. At the time of writing, all of the aforementioned apps were available to download from &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Play Store and Apple’s App Store in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it had yet to receive the order from New Delhi. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; said it was reviewing the order. The companies have traditionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/indian-court-lifts-ban-on-tiktok-in-india/&quot;&gt;complied with such app removal requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Delhi said it had received “many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday evening’s announcement is the latest standoff between the two neighboring nations following a deadly clash at the border earlier this month that stoked historical tensions. In recent weeks, custom officials at major Indian ports and airports have halted clearances of industrial consignments coming from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayanth Kolla, an analyst at research firm Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch the move was surprising and will have huge impact on Chinese firms, many of which count India as their biggest market. He said banning these apps would also hurt the livelihood of several Indians who directly or indirectly work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-China sentiment has been gaining mindshare in India in recent weeks, since more than 20 Indian soldiers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html&quot;&gt;killed in a military clash&lt;/a&gt; in the Himalayas earlier this month. “Boycott China” — and variations of it — has been trending on Twitter in India ever since as a growing number of people posted videos demonstrating destruction of Chinese-made smartphones, TVs and other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese smartphone makers command more than 80% of the smartphone market in India, which is the world’s second largest. For SoftBank-backed TikTok, which has more than 200 million monthly active users in India, New Delhi’s move is its latest headache. The Chinese firm has also faced scrutiny in Europe and the United States in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok has been facing backlash in India since the second half of May after users unearthed and shared numerous recent TikTok videos on Twitter that appeared to promote domestic violence, animal cruelty, racism, child abuse and objectification of women. Many in India rushed to leave a poor rating of the TikTok app in the Google Play Store to express their disgust — and the Android-maker &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/google-removes-millions-of-negative-tiktok-reviews-amid-backlash-in-india/&quot;&gt;had to intervene and delete millions of comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days later, an app called “Remove China Apps” gained popularity among some Indians. Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/remove-china-apps-google-play-store/&quot;&gt;pulled the app later from the Play Store citing it violated its guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. A TikTok spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, India &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/&quot;&gt;amended its foreign direct investment policy&lt;/a&gt; to require all neighboring nations, including China, with which it shares a boundary to seek approval from New Delhi for their future investments in India. The nation’s Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade said it was taking this measure to “curb the opportunistic takeover” of Indian firms that are grappling with challenges due to the coronavirus crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When TikTok app was blocked in India for a week last year, ByteDance had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-india-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-bytedance-says-india-tiktok-ban-causing-500000-daily-loss-risks-jobs-idUSKCN1RZ0QC&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a court filing that it was losing more than $500,000 a day in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>There’s no replacement for the thrill of browsing in a bookstore</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/theres-no-replacement-for-the-thrill-of-browsing-in-a-bookstore/2020/06/25/20855c1a-abf1-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/theres-no-replacement-for-the-thrill-of-browsing-in-a-bookstore/2020/06/25/20855c1a-abf1-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;My local independent bookstore was shuttered, but my local Goodwill was open. So, mask on, I went in, reviving for a moment a familiar routine. A Goodwill isn’t my preferred browsing experience, but sometimes there were decent finds amid the dross of donations, and at this point any shelf of books besides my own would be a balm: programming manuals, Mormon doctrine, math textbooks, dog-eared classics, stacks of Tom Clancy and Stephen King. Yes, please, fine. There wasn’t a single book on the shelf that I felt like buying that time around, and few I felt like touching. But the opportunity to look felt like plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11.157012195122&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The covid-Zoom era has made bookshelf snoops of all of us. Late-night host Seth Meyers has reshuffled stacks of books on the endtable in his attic where he’s now taping his show, treating his copy of Colleen McCullough’s novel “&lt;a href=&quot;https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000FC146C&amp;amp;preview=newtab&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_6VI9EbBCGNCNX&amp;amp;tag=thewaspos09-20&quot; title=&quot;read.amazon.com&quot;&gt;The Thorn Birds&lt;/a&gt;” like it’s a discount Ed McMahon. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/147727.Seth_Myers_Quarantine_Attic&quot; title=&quot;www.goodreads.com&quot;&gt;A Goodreads list is keeping track of his selections&lt;/a&gt;.) Celebrities and experts compelled to conduct interviews from home have been committing naked acts of performative shelving, putting on their best intellectual face for the webcams, inspiring plenty of speculation about the speakers’ inner lives — or at least a few rounds of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/nyregion/power-broker-tv.html&quot; title=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Spot ‘The Power Broker’&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;But squinting at strangers’ bookcases is only so satisfying, and as weeks in quarantine have dragged on, I’ve wanted a browsing experience that’s more promiscuously bookish. For a dedicated reader like myself, it’s a serious loss: Shuttered bookstores are a reminder of how much of our reading lives is a process of discovery, and how online retailers’ attempts to re-create the discovery experience tend to be huge letdowns. Algorithms can tell you what you like based on what you’ve said you liked before. They can also make a few guesses at what you might like based on what other people say they like that’s related to what you’ve said you like. But they can’t introduce you to the thing you might like for the first time, all for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;13.922105263158&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;The story of being a reader is often a story of being surprised in a bookstore. It’s where Zeno first heard of Socrates, and where Nietzsche learned of Schopenhauer. In 1916, the critic &lt;a href=&quot;http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/tom-bissell-unflowered-aloes&quot; title=&quot;bostonreview.net&quot;&gt;Carl Van Doren was in a used bookstore when he spotted Herman Melville’s forgotten 1851 novel, “Moby-Dick,”&lt;/a&gt; a happy accident that resurrected what’s now recognized as one of America’s greatest novels. Many of the books I love most and recommend most fervently were books I stumbled upon. I didn’t realize I needed a smirking handbook to the American class system until I spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671792253?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thewaspos09-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0671792253&quot; title=&quot;www.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Paul Fussell’s “Class,”&lt;/a&gt; didn’t know how satisfying the Western could be till I spied “&lt;a href=&quot;https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B003NE6HD4&amp;amp;preview=newtab&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_.4I9Eb19YYNJE&amp;amp;tag=thewaspos09-20&quot; title=&quot;read.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/a&gt;,” didn’t know James Baldwin till I found a cheap paperback of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00BABTC20&amp;amp;preview=newtab&amp;amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_W6I9Eb4M56QA3&amp;amp;tag=thewaspos09-20&quot; title=&quot;read.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Giovanni’s Room&lt;/a&gt;.” We find our favorite books in the same way we often find our closest friends, brought together by circumstances that are unexpected but somehow true to our personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Algorithms miss all that; Netflix and Amazon tend to promote what’s new at the expense of what’s available, and what’s available feels small and manipulative. And with algorithms, you can’t quite shake the unsettling feeling that your consumption habits are being watched. Because, of course, they are. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;Bookstores have their limitations, too, of course. Every inch of shelf space needs to make money, especially these days, so any responsible shop will stuff its front tables and endcaps with hot new titles and reliable sellers. But any place selling books, whether it’s a messy Goodwill or a well-curated antiquarian store, recognizes that the surprise and randomness within a vast array of options are part of the appeal. We want to look, and we want to look at a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;10.944858420268&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;I confess it took the novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;contextual_link&quot;&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; to clue me in to the fact that passionate YA and genre readers have been on top of this feeling for years. Type “bookshelf tour” into YouTube and you’ll discover an abundance of booktubers enthusing over their collections, guiding viewers through their shelves with stories about how they acquired a particular rare title or signed copy, or just bragging about their organizational schemes. Some of these videos run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyQvDInUCU4&quot; title=&quot;www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;60 minutes or more&lt;/a&gt; (“AN HOUR WORTH OF BRITTANY AND HER SHELVES? YES!”); many of them have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT7HkqrqvC4&quot; title=&quot;www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;hundreds of thousands of views&lt;/a&gt;. Many thoughts about Ikea are shared; misordered titles trigger OCD in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;15.933054393305&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;More recently, because of stay-at-home orders, authors have been getting into the act. Last month, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster began posting videos of its authors conducting bookshelf tours while plugging their favorite local indie stores. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFVav_B9MgI&quot; title=&quot;www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;Cassandra Clare’s book barn&lt;/a&gt; — a book barn! — includes a signed first edition of “Catch-22” and vintage copies of the Strand magazine, where Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNurr4e6YOo&quot; title=&quot;www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;Mitchell Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, author of “Survival Math,” shared some of his favorite works of African American literature, drawn from what looks like a precarious vertical stack but is actually a clever shelving system. Never let it be said that the bookshelf tour video lacks drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;No doubt cabin fever is having its way with me, but watching these videos I find myself thinking: “Zoom in!” “Pan across the shelves!” “Slower!” Bookstores in lockdown would have at least one dedicated viewer if they produced videos of nothing but their shelves, tracking them closely, focusing on the spines. It would be a sort of white noise machine for the eyes — a way to scope out what’s available, to see what books are, to spark a little of that feeling of surprise yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md&quot;&gt;For now, the abundant online bookshelf tours will have to suffice. Watch a few of them on YouTube, and YouTube pushes more of them to you. And for once, the algorithm seems to actually know what it’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md italic&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Athitakis&lt;/strong&gt; is a critic in Phoenix and author of “The New Midwest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Apple and Facebook</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the big four consumer tech companies — Microsoft’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/microsoft-to-close-retail-stores.html&quot;&gt;close its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; was the culmination of a step-back from the consumer space &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/wework-and-bubble-talk-ubers-losses-microsoft-exits-consumer-space/&quot;&gt;five years in the making&lt;/a&gt; — Google and Amazon have always had moats that were easier to understand. Google has a huge advantage in data and infrastructure, augmented by its control of consumer touch points (by owning Android outright, and paying heavily for default placement on other platforms); Amazon has a huge advantage in infrastructure and data, augmented by its control of the number one consumer touch point for shopping (the Amazon search box). Building a competitor for either feels daunting at best, impossible at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple’s Moat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, though, faced questions about the sustainability of its business for years, even after the runaway success of the iPhone; one of the topics that helped Stratechery gain traction in its first year was arguing that the iPhone was actually not about to be disrupted as so many — including &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/&quot;&gt;Professor Clayton Christensen himself&lt;/a&gt; — were sure was going to happen. I explained why Apple’s approach was sustainable in 2014’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/best/&quot;&gt;Best&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, integrated solutions will just about always be superior when it comes to the user experience: if you make the whole thing, you can ensure everything works well together, avoiding the inevitable rough spots and lack of optimization that comes with standards and interconnects. The key, though, is that this integration and experience be valued by the user. That is why — and this was the crux of my criticism of Christensen’s development of the theory — the user experience angle only matters when the buyer of a product is also the user. Users care about the user experience (surprise), but an isolated buyer — as is the case for most business-to-business products, and all of Christensen’s examples — does not. I believe this was the root of Christensen’s blind spot about Apple, which persists. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/clay-christensen-defends-disruption-theory-2014-10&quot;&gt;an interview with Henry Blodget&lt;/a&gt; a month ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can predict with perfect certainty that if Apple is having that extraordinary experience, the people with modularity are striving. You can predict that they are motivated to figure out how to emulate what they are offering, but with modularity. And so ultimately, unless there is no ceiling, at some point Apple hits the ceiling. So their options are hopefully they can come up with another product category or something that is proprietary because they really are good at developing products that are proprietary. Most companies have that insight into closed operating systems once, they hit the ceiling, and then they crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the thing though: the quality of a user experience &lt;em&gt;has no ceiling.&lt;/em&gt; As nearly every other consumer industry has shown, as long as there is a clear delineation between the top-of-the-line and everything else, some segment of the user base will pay a premium for the best. That’s the key to Apple’s future: they don’t need completely new products every other year (or half-decade); they just need to keep creating the best stuff in their categories. Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy, of course, and yet when it comes to hardware in particular, Apple’s lead is greater than it ever was, thanks in large part to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-arm-and-intel/&quot;&gt;superior systems-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt;; the headline news from WWDC was that Apple is extending that particular advantage &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-os-x/&quot;&gt;to the Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course having the best device is not enough either — this was the other reason why Apple was, according to many, eternally doomed; here is Blodget again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-being-greedy-2013-9&quot;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013:&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/#footnote_0_5080&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_5080&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;I previously quoted this piece in Beachheads and Obstacles.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If smartphones and tablets were not a platform — if the only thing that mattered to the value of the product and a customer’s purchase decision was the gadget itself — then Apple’s loss of market share would not make a difference. Apple zealots would be correct when they smugly assert that what matters is Apple’s “profit share” not “market share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But smartphones and tablets are a platform. Third-party companies are building apps and services to run on smartphone and tablet platforms. These apps and services, in turn, are making the platforms more valuable. Consumers are standardizing their lives around the apps and services that run on smartphone and tablet platforms. Because of these “network effects,” in platform markets, dominant market share is huge competitive advantage. In platform markets, as the often-hated but always insanely powerful Microsoft demonstrated for decades in the PC market, the vast majority of the power and profits eventually accrue to the market-share leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it turned out that Apple’s prioritization of the user experience wasn’t simply a moat, but also a point of leverage with developers, who need Apple much more than Apple needs them. Thus the second big story over the last two weeks, which has been Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/&quot;&gt;App Store policies&lt;/a&gt;: it appears that Apple has significantly tightened its unwritten rules over the last year as the company seeks to increase its Services revenue. Developers, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/&quot;&gt;the smallest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-new-reality-apples-transition-strategy-apple-v-developers-continued/&quot;&gt;the largest&lt;/a&gt;, have no choice but to accede to the iPhone maker’s demands because Apple has combined the loyalty of the most valuable users with App Review, an unavoidable gatekeeper in terms of getting apps onto those users’ iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bill Gates Line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, meanwhile, is often thought of as being the opposite of Apple: Apple sells products, and Facebook sells advertising. Apple minimizes data collection, and Facebook maximizes it. Apple is a platform, and Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2013/mobile-makes-facebook-just-an-app-thats-great-news/&quot;&gt;just an app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What both share, though, is a sort of eternal skepticism from Silicon Valley in particular. Facebook, for its part, has been doubted from its formation to its decision to decline Yahoo’s acquisition offer to its post-IPO stock price slump; every hot new social app, from Twitter to Snapchat to TikTok, is framed as the service that will finally doom Facebook to being the next MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, though, is that in many respects Facebook is more of a platform than Apple is. In 2018 I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;The Bill Gates Line&lt;/a&gt;, which was actually coined as criticism of Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks I have been exploring what differences there are between platforms and aggregators, and was reminded of this anecdote from Chamath Palihapitiya in &lt;a href=&quot;http://haystack.vc/2015/09/17/transcript-chamath-at-strictlyvcs-insider-series/&quot;&gt;an interview with Semil Shah&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semil Shah:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you see any similarities from your time at Facebook with Facebook platform and connect, and how Uber may supercharge their platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya:&lt;/strong&gt; Neither of them are platforms. They’re both kind of like these comical endeavors that do you as an Nth priority. I was in charge of Facebook Platform. We trumpeted it out like it was some hot shit big deal. And I remember when we raised money from Bill Gates, 3 or 4 months after — like our funding history was $5M, $83 M, $500M, and then $15B. When that 15B happened a few months after Facebook Platform and Gates said something along the lines of, “That’s a crock of shit. This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this measure Windows was indeed the ultimate platform — the company used to brag about only capturing a minority of the total value of the Windows ecosystem — and the operating system’s clear successors are Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s own Azure Cloud Services. In all three cases there are strong and durable businesses to be built on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1024x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;A drawing of Platform Businesses Attract Customers by Third Parties&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3468&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1024x552.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-300x162.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-768x414.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1168x630.png 1168w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a platform dips under the Bill Gates Line, though, the long-term potential of a business built on a “platform” starts to decline. Apple’s App Store, for example, has all of the trappings of a platform, but Apple quite clearly captures the vast majority of the overall ecosystem, both because of the profitability of the iPhone and also because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;its control of App Store economics&lt;/a&gt;; the paucity of strong and durable businesses on the App Store is a natural outgrowth of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-1024x542.png&quot; alt=&quot;A drawing of Apple's Control of the App Store Ecosystem&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3504&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-1024x542.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-300x159.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-768x406.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-1190x630.png 1190w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Apple’s ability to control the economics of its developers comes from intermediating the relationship of those developers with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing in this story is how exactly all of those developers made money on the App Store. Yes, without question, a big part of it was the iPhone’s explosive growth and how the App Store made it easy and safe to install apps. Another very big part of it, though, was Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Facebook’s Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s early stumbles on mobile are well-documented: &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20130414025919/http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-home.pr.fortune/&quot;&gt;the company bet on web-based apps&lt;/a&gt; that just didn’t work very well; the company completely rewrote its iOS app even as it was going public, which meant it had a stagnating app at the exact time mobile was exploding, threatening the desktop advertising product and platform that were the basis of the company’s S-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The re-write turned out to be not just a company-saving move — the native mobile app had the exact same user-facing features as the web-centric one, with the rather important detail that it actually worked — but in fact an industry-transformational one: one of the first new products enabled by the company’s new app were app install ads. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/facebook-mobile-app-install-ads/&quot;&gt;From TechCrunch in 2012&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is making a big bet on the app economy, and wants to be the top source of discovery outside of the app stores. The mobile app install ads let developers buy tiles that promote their apps in the Facebook mobile news feed. When tapped, these instantly open the Apple App Store or Google Play market where users can download apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads are working already. One client TinyCo saw a 50% higher click through rate and higher conversion rates compared to other install channels. Facebook’s ads also brought in more engaged users. Ads tech startup Nanigans clients attained 8-10X more reach than traditional mobile ad buys when it purchased Facebook mobile app install ads. AdParlor racked up a consistent 1-2% click through rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s App Install product quickly became the most important channel for acquiring users, particularly for games that monetized with Apple’s in-app purchase API: the combination of Facebook data with developer’s sophisticated understanding of expected value per app install led to an explosion in App Store revenue. And yet, even this was seen as a reason to doubt Facebook; in 2015 I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/daily-update-bill-gurley-wrong-facebook-youtubes-competition/&quot;&gt;a prominent venture capitalist’s Facebook skepticism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the criticism of app install ads rests on obsolete assumptions that view apps as fun baubles instead of the dominant interaction layer between companies and consumers. If you start with the premise that apps are more important than web pages or any other form of interaction when it comes to connecting with consumers, being the dominant channel for app installs seems downright safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, though, at least some portion of Facebook’s revenue must come from app-install ads for games, no? Absolutely! But even that is less of a danger than critics think for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a mistake to assume that just because venture-backed companies have a tendency to be profligate with their money that app install ad spending is little more than “spray-and-pray”. In fact, app install ads are not just direct marketing, which is much easier to track, Facebook app install ads in particular are one of the most data rich ad formats around…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, were I a venture capitalist like Gurley, I would be gun-shy about mobile gaming; there are a whole host of examples of one-shot wonders that attract funding or even IPO on a hit game only to struggle to recreate their initial success. I think it’s a really hard area to invest in. Facebook, though, doesn’t need to care if a particular gaming company succeeds or fails, because they aren’t exposed to any one gaming company: they have exposure to the industry as a whole. And on that note:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile gaming revenue is not a flash-in-the-pan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/01/15/mobile-console-game-revenues-2015/&quot;&gt;According to Newzoo&lt;/a&gt;, a video game research firm, global mobile game revenues is expected to surpass console revenue this year. Interestingly — and perhaps this makes the space a bit of a blind-spot for U.S.-based observers — console spending will still dominate in North America ($11.1 billion to $7.2 billion); it’s in the rest of the world — particularly in Asia — where mobile is absolutely dominant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Ultimately, if there is a bubble, everyone will suffer, including Facebook. But big picture I continue to consider the company the most underrated in the Valley (which is kind of amazing). Facebook has barely scratched the surface of their monetization capabilities, brand advertising has yet to migrate from TV, Instagram still isn’t monetized at all, and to cap it off Facebook usage is still increasing. This is a juggernaut that, if there is a downturn, is more likely to be the exception to industry doldrums than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this excerpt is about mobile games, the analysis applies to a whole host of industries that have grown up on Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/&quot;&gt;like direct-to-consumer e-commerce companies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook’s targeting is a particularly potent combination for companies that convert on-line. Indeed, the biggest mistake I’ve made in evaluating the company is over-estimating the potential of brand advertising and under-appreciating just how large the direct response opportunity was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatedly, the direct response opportunity is so large because Facebook has created the conditions for new direct response-based companies to be created. For apps, this opportunity was created in conjunction with Apple and Google (Android); for e-commerce this opportunity was created &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/&quot;&gt;in conjunction with Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. What both examples have in common is that Facebook’s advertising was a critical factor in creating new businesses that were unique to the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not just mobile gaming that is more than a flash-in-the-pain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/never-ending-niches/&quot;&gt;the transformative impact of the Internet is only starting to be felt&lt;/a&gt;, which is to say that the long run will be less about traditional companies adopting digital than it will be about their entire way of doing business being rendered obsolete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite examples are CPG companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Facebook’s Anti-Fragility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/&quot;&gt;TV Advertising’s Surprising Strength — And Inevitable Fall&lt;/a&gt; I observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very institution of television advertising is intertwined with the kinds of advertisers that use it the most, the products they sell, and the way they are bought-and-sold. And what should be terrifying to television executives is that all of those pieces that make television advertising the gold mine that it has been are under the exact same threat that TV watching itself is: the threat of the Internet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPG is the perfect example: building a “house of brands” allows a company like Procter &amp;amp; Gamble to target demographic groups even as they leverage scale to invest in R&amp;amp;D, bring down the cost of products, and most importantly, dominate the distribution channel (i.e. retail shelf space). Said retailers, meanwhile, are huge in their own right, not only so they can match their massive suppliers at the bargaining table but also so they can scale logistics, inventory management, store development, etc. Automobile companies, meanwhile, are not unlike CPG companies: they operate a “house of brands” to serve different demographics while benefitting from scale in production and distribution; the primary difference is that they make money through one large purchase instead of over many smaller purchases over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar principles apply to the other companies on this list: all are looking to reach as many consumers as possible with blunt targeting at best, all benefit from scale, and all are looking to earn significant lifetime value from consumers. And, along those lines, all can afford the expense of TV. In fact, the top 200 advertisers in the U.S. love TV so much that they make up 80% of television advertising, despite accounting for only 51% of total advertising (and 41% of digital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very different picture from Facebook, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/25/facebook-inc-fb-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx&quot;&gt;as of Q1 2019&lt;/a&gt; the top 100 advertisers made up less than 20% of the company’s ad revenue; most of the $69.7 billion the company brought in last year came from its long tail of 8 million advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on the long-tail, which is only possible because of Facebook’s fully automated ad-buying system, has turned out to be a tremendous asset during the coronavirus slow-down. I explained after &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/facebook-earnings-auction-dynamics-full-steam-ahead/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Q1 2020 earnings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first bit gets at the other thing the Wall Street Journal article got wrong: it is not simply that direct response stayed strong while brand advertising declined, but rather that Facebook actually received more direct response advertising because brand advertising declined…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, though, what happens in a situation like the coronavirus crisis, where a segment of advertisers competing for limited inventory stop buying ads: the mobile gaming company doesn’t reduce their budget — to do so would be to kill the company! — but in fact ends up getting more efficient spend. Suddenly the clearing price for the auction to show those app install ads is $0.75 per app install; now the mobile gaming company is getting 26,667 app installs for its $20,000 spend, which results in an expected profit of $6,667.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does, obviously, entail downside for Facebook — that extra ~$6,000 in profit is out of Facebook’s pocket — but at the same time the loss is capped because not only is the mobile gaming company not reducing its spend, it is in fact incentivized to increase its spend given the reduced competition and thus increased profitability for its ads. And, of course, as that opportunity is seized on by more and more companies, Facebook’s profits, which in the end are gated by the amount of inventory it has, not only return to normal but arguably have more upside, given that usage of the platform is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Apple Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, though, has a vulnerability: Apple. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://adage.com/article/digital/apples-privacy-changes-represent-tectonic-shift-digital-ad-industry/2263841&quot;&gt;AdAge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple announced new privacy changes to its upcoming iOS 14 software that will significantly hinder how media buyers and brands target, measure and find consumers. One change will make it harder for apps to track iOS users across different apps and websites. Another will make attribution — determining which tactics contribute to sales or conversions — harder for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, announced Monday at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, apply to the company’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which assigns a unique number to a user’s mobile device. Advertisers have access to the feature and use it in areas including ad targeting, building lookalike audiences, attribution and encouraging consumers to download apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDFA is shared with app makers and advertisers by default, but that will change once iOS 14 rolls out this fall. Then, users must give explicit permission through a popup for app publishers to track them across different apps and websites, or to share that information with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook was the king of the IDFA (and the Google Advertising ID equivalent on Android): it was the linchpin around which its app install business in particular was built. The company could understand when a user spent a certain amount in a game, for example, look for users that were similar, and then display an app install ad for that game, and measure how effective it was. In fact, over the last few years, Facebook has simply asked advertisers to specify what return on ad spend they are hoping to achieve, and Facebook does all of the work of figuring out how many ads to display to which users — the entire process is automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the business is going to change a lot. Apple was quite clever in their approach: instead of killing the IDFA, which could be construed as anti-competitive, particularly given Apple’s expanding app install ad business (which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/apple-could-soon-start-running-search-ads-outside-of-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;expanding beyond App Store search ads&lt;/a&gt;), Apple is simply asking users if they would like to be tracked, and letting them render the IDFA useless. Notably, Facebook has declined to even show app install advertisements to the 30% of U.S. iPhone users that turned off their IDFA of their own accord — and now it is opt-in, instead of opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I wouldn’t count Facebook out: to the extent the company is hurt, it seems likely that the universe of 3rd-party ad tech companies that lack Facebook’s direct connection with users, both in terms of data collection and ad display, will be in far worse shape, and it is not as if the digital ecosystem — and its associated advertising — is going to disappear. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-union-versus-the-internet/&quot;&gt;much like GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, the safe bet is the company with the wherewithal to make lemons out of lemonade. Notably, Apple’s alternative for app install ad campaigns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork&quot;&gt;SKAdNetwork&lt;/a&gt;, is so limited that there is likely to be tremendous value in whatever company can create the exact sort of automated campaign creation that Facebook is already offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that Apple’s crackdown on web cookies has also helped Facebook, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/&quot;&gt;I explained last month&lt;/a&gt;; by making it more difficult for 3rd-party payment providers to offer a seamless experience, Apple is opening the door to Facebook taking over payments for direct-to-consumer companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Shops is a perfect example: it is going to succeed because it is good for Shopify’s merchants, but the reason it is good for Shopify’s merchants is because Facebook and Apple effectively teamed up to make it impossible for Shopify to fix the payment problem on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what makes the Apple-Facebook dynamic so fascinating: Facebook’s biggest opportunities come from filling in the holes in Apple’s platform proposition, even as Apple seems opposed to Facebook at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shared Risk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is particularly notable is how conflict between the two companies threatens their greatest assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with Apple: while its battle against cookies and effective obliteration of the IDFA are from one perspective deeply rooted in its focus on users, it is impossible to ignore the company’s focus on Services revenue. Making the web less useful makes apps more useful, from which Apple can take its share; similarly, it is notable that Apple is expanding its own app install product even as it is knee-capping the industry’s. The question is if these attempts to maximize services revenue are in service of the user experience, or Apple’s bottom line; the company should take care to remember that the latter follows the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, meanwhile, already sees promise in taking business from its best partners, as seen in the announcement of Facebook Shops; there may be a similar temptation when it comes to IDFA, given that the IDFV — &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor&quot;&gt;Identifier for Vendor&lt;/a&gt;, which allows a vendor to get the device ID from its own apps — is still available. Might Facebook consider shifting its business model from being an advertising platform for other apps into a WeChat-like publishing model for the most popular games and services?&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/#footnote_1_5080&quot; id=&quot;identifier_1_5080&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;I do expect a lot of consolidation in the mobile gaming industry, particularly amongst hyper-casual game publishers, for exactly this reason&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The company should also take care: its service of the long tail has not only made it more of a Bill-Gates platform than Apple, but is also the foundation of the company’s strength in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, what seems clearer than ever is that it is these two companies, Apple and Facebook, that are driving the industry. That their approaches are so different is in fact why they are the pairing that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Klutz Press: books built for learning stuff</title>

<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create wonderful things, be good, have fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the credo of Klutz Press, the most important book publisher of my childhood. It being summer and all, Hobbes, ol' buddy... let's going exploring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes a Klutz Press book so good for learning stuff?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've heard of Klutz, then you've likely seen their debut: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932592007/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0932592007&amp;amp;linkId=adaa512e8af09feab7c571ec8f2863cc&quot;&gt;Juggling For the Complete Klutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/1cfc2/juggling.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;juggling&quot; title=&quot;juggling&quot; src=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/a6d36/juggling.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/222b7/juggling.png 163w, /static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/ff46a/juggling.png 325w, /static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/a6d36/juggling.png 650w, /static/c28fcf440265c6bea76d51f90e51b462/1cfc2/juggling.png 900w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, I highly suggest seeking out a copy. Keep in mind, it's more than just a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;em&gt;Juggling for the Complete Klutz&lt;/em&gt; has these amazing attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's spiral-bound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has hilarious drawings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes attached with three real-life bean bags!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are book super-powers, in my book (a Klutz-worthy pun?). In our day, my sister and I owned, devoured, and treasured these Klutz titles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, there was nothing better than getting a new Klutz book (ok, maybe a Super Nintendo game). But unlike a replay of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario RPG&lt;/em&gt;, these Klutz books require no nostaglia goggles. Here's why I think they're magic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Klutz books are spiral-bound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books for learning stuff should be able to open up and stay flat. The old 1980s computer manuals for computers like the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer&quot;&gt;my new old Apple IIe&lt;/a&gt; knew this much -- their manuals were spiral-bound and spell-binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why don't we see more spiral-bound books? Without knowing that much about printing costs, I imagine they're more expensive. Also, they do look slightly worse on a bookshelf, especially if you're going for that 'grammable color pattern look (so, just don't do this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Klutz books come with the required materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little &quot;paper&quot; football that came with the &lt;em&gt;Table Top Football: A Guide to the Classic Lunchroom Sport&lt;/em&gt; was a revered grail of mine. I remember that my dad took a sheetrock knife and made a small incision in its plastic case attached to the book so that the football could be slid in and out, with the explicit rule that the football must either be &lt;em&gt;in the case&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;being used in a game&lt;/em&gt;. This is much like the inexorable &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypercritical.co&quot;&gt;Jon Siracusan&lt;/a&gt; rule for Airpods. Obey, or the Airpods will be instantly lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/20f07/football.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;football&quot; title=&quot;football&quot; src=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/20f07/football.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/d2f63/football.jpg 163w, /static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/c989d/football.jpg 325w, /static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/20f07/football.jpg 334w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note that there are some people who just love making small cuts into the plastic cases for things, so that you easily return them to their &quot;pristine&quot; condition. I, myself, don't understand these people. I like wripping these cases to shreds instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to these Klutz books. By including juggling bean bags, yarn for friendship bracelets, or a real harmonica, Klutz Press books gave you everything you needed to get your hands dirty. &quot;Active learning&quot;, or something like that. Playing = learning. Etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Klutz books have hilarious art&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/6c99ba6e2419ae976e32b7e293532a7a/20e5d/shenanigan.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;shenanigan&quot; title=&quot;shenanigan&quot; src=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/6c99ba6e2419ae976e32b7e293532a7a/20e5d/shenanigan.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/6c99ba6e2419ae976e32b7e293532a7a/d2f63/shenanigan.jpg 163w, /static/6c99ba6e2419ae976e32b7e293532a7a/c989d/shenanigan.jpg 325w, /static/6c99ba6e2419ae976e32b7e293532a7a/20e5d/shenanigan.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at that paper airplane stuck in the teacher's hair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klutz had a particular art direction that spoke to me as a child. The goofy people in their guides made me feel like it was &lt;em&gt;okay to be a klutz&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the most important reason that Klutz books are special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Klutz books embrace the Beginner's Mindset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the experts mind there are few - Shunryū Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone starts out as a klutz. No matter what. That means it's okay to make mistakes. It can even be funny - in fact, it should be funny! Because it's fun to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a klutz, making mistakes, having fun, this is the path to wonderful things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's behind Klutz Press?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutz_Press&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Klutz Press was founded in 1977 by three friends in Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apocryphal story is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(author)&quot;&gt;John Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, a recent Stanford grad working as a high school teacher, brought a bucket of tennis balls and some hand-written instructions for juggling to his remedial reading class. The laughs and learning and genuine reading and genuine juggling that ensued inspired Cassidy and his buddies from Stanford to publish &lt;em&gt;Juggling For the Complete Klutz&lt;/em&gt; under their new company: Klutz Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juggling For the Complete Klutz&lt;/em&gt; has sold over 2.5 million copies. But Googling for Klutz Press is somewhat challenging these days. In 2000, Klutz was acquired by a company called Nelvana for $74 million, and in 2002 Klutz became a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc. This latter merger is a good match in my book, as the Scholastic Book Fair also ranks heavily in my childhood memories of learning to love reading. The only other company I'd feel comfortable with owning Klutz Press is Pizza Hut - thanks to their delicious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookitprogram.com/&quot;&gt;BOOK-IT!&lt;/a&gt; reading program, which brought me dozens of delicious cheese Personal Pan Pizzas during the 1990s. My parents couldn't decide if they hated or loved Pizza Hut for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Klutz.com redirects to the Scholastic website, and it's unclear what's out-of-print or available from the voluminous Klutz catalog. So if you do find a genuine Klutz book and kit, I'd snag them quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I was able to find a good interview with Cassidy from 1995 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182712/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v83/ai_16857996/&quot;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. In 1995, Klutz was at the height of their power and influence in kid's minds. Here are some choice quotes from Cassidy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their company culture at Klutz Press:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In terms of being laid back, we take a back seat to nobody.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their &quot;teaching&quot; style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Talk to a kid about fun and math, and it's like you're talking about two different sides of the universe. If we can climb this mountain, there's nothing we can't tackle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kids don't learn all that much by listening or reading. They need to get elbow-deep in a subject and touch it, feel it, and smell it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of Seymour Paypert's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046746/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465046746&amp;amp;linkId=2949aefc36d4bd9d9f632170d2ac23de&quot;&gt;Mindstorms book&lt;/a&gt; about his work with LOGO and the Turtle machine (you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charlieharrington.com/mindstorms&quot;&gt;my notes&lt;/a&gt; on the book)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article explains a bit about their business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of Klutz' books sell for less than $20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can have low prices because: (1) the books (with their accompanying &quot;stuff&quot;) are viewed as more than books - but &quot;toys/novelties&quot;, so more retailers than booksellers are interesting in carring them, and (2) they do large printing runs (150k copies vs the usual 10k for children's books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, importantly, the final word from Cassidy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can hang a spoon off my nose,&quot; Cassidy boasts, &quot;and I take a lot of pride in that&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create wonderful things, be good, have fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to write that out again. I've decided to adopt their credo as my own life motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned so much from Klutz Press as a kid. I'm still learning now. Thank you, John Cassidy and team, for making these wonderful books. My juggling is finally starting to get pretty good, but I'll always be a klutz.&lt;/p&gt;
