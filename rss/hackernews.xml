<title>Early Retirement May Speed Up Cognitive Decline: Study</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.studyfinds.org/if-you-rest-you-rust-study-finds-early-retirement-may-speed-up-cognitive-decline/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — &lt;/strong&gt;It’s hard to think of an early retirement as anything other than a positive. Who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/most-people-grow-bored-retirement-just-one-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wouldn’t want to&lt;/a&gt; trade in their suit and tie for a pair of beach shorts? While retiring ahead of schedule may be easier on the body, a new set of research has found that it may not be so beneficial for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted at Binghamton University, finds that an early retirement can accelerate the usual rate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/mindfulness-meditation-can-slow-mci-cognitive-decline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; among the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed China’s new rural pension scheme (NRPS), as well as China’s most recent Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS), in order to investigate the effects of early retirement and pension benefits on individual cognition among adults over the age of 60. For reference, CHARLS is a representative national survey of China’s population over the age of 45 that tests respondents regarding mental cognition, episodic memory, and overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/stressed-city-mental-wellbeing-nature-birds-birdsong/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;mental wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy rates in China have steadily increased over the past few decades, coinciding with a decline in fertility. These two trends have resulted in a large elderly population in the Asian nation, subsequently creating an urgent need for more robust pension programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going over all of the data, the research team noted a clear trend: individuals receiving pension benefits were experiencing much more rapid mental decline than their counterparts still on the workforce. The most prominent indicator of mental decline among retirees was delayed recall, a trait widely considered to be an accurate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/eat-mushrooms-twice-week-slow-cognitive-decline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;predictor of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, females seemed to experience even sharper mental decline after retiring early. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that decreased mental activity accelerates cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Individuals in the areas that implement the NRPS score considerably lower than individuals who live in areas that do not offer the NRPS program,” says study author and assistant professor economics Plamen Nikolov in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2117/research-shows-that-early-retirement-can-accelerate-cognitive-decline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;release.&lt;/a&gt; “Over the almost 10 years since its implementation, the program led to a decline in cognitive performance by as high as almost a fifth of a standard deviation on the memory measures we examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study’s findings were similar to previous research that had focused on the impact of retirement on elderly individuals living in the United States, England, and the European Union. So, this is hardly a trend limited to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikolov had actually conducted previous studies that found retirement led to a number of positive physical health benefits for retirees, such as improved sleep patterns, less stress, and reduced alcohol consumption. However, retirement is also usually accompanied with a decline in social activities and less &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/kind-elders-positive-social-support-reduce-dementia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;overall interaction with people&lt;/a&gt;, which has also been linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For cognition among the elderly, it looks like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studyfinds.org/pain-loneliness-osteoarthritis-linked-to-social-isolation-among-seniors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;negative effect on social engagement&lt;/a&gt; far outweighed the positive effect of the program on nutrition and sleep,” Nikolov theorizes. “Or alternatively, the kinds of things that matter and determine better health might simply be very different than the kinds of things that matter for better cognition among the elderly. Social engagement and connectedness may simply be the single most powerful factors for cognitive performance in old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team are hopeful that their findings will be considered by older adults when mulling retirement, but perhaps more importantly, they hope that policy makers in developing countries take note while drawing up new pension plans. They recommend instituting social get-togethers and work shops for recent retirees to help lessen the predicted decline in social interaction and critical thinking that often comes along with retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iza.org/en/publications/dp/12524/do-pension-benefits-accelerate-cognitive-decline-evidence-from-rural-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; is published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;IZA Institute of Labor Economics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nautilus to be acquired by an investor group of fans</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/blog/nautilus-to-be-acquired-by-ownership-group-of-super_fans</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/blog/nautilus-to-be-acquired-by-ownership-group-of-super_fans</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the newswire:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Award-winning magazine and fast-growing science brand poised for growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;n investor group of super-fans has banded together as a single ownership group to acquire &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nautilus&lt;/a&gt;, the literary science magazine with more than 10 thousand monthly paying subscribers and an online reach of more than 10 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed acquisition is subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory and governmental approvals. The proposed deal involves implementation of an all-new digital strategy and website that will roll out over the next year. The proposed new ownership group is planning for aggressive investment in editorial, reader experience, and new products. Subscribers to the beloved print edition of Nautilus will be pleased to hear it will continue uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed new ownership group is led by serial media entrepreneur, Daily Dot co-founder and CEO Nicholas White, who will assume the same title at Nautilus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nautilus is the best and brightest science brand I know,” said White. “It’s also a love letter to the intersection of science, art, and culture. It will be an honor and privilege to help steward our team and mission. The editorial operation at Nautilus is world class and will remain so. Our proposed plan will put the right growth team in place, which will allow us to deliver Nautilus to the wide audience it so clearly deserves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nautilus is a “different kind of science magazine” per the company’s website. It delivers deep, undiluted, narrative storytelling that “brings science into the largest and most important conversations we are having today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White is joined in the proposed new ownership group by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ben Lamm, CEO of Hypergiant Industries, serial entrepreneur, and investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larry Summers, 71st Secretary of the Treasury, former Chief Economist of the World Bank, Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus, Harvard University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexander Falk, co-founder and CEO Altova and prominent angel investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josh Jones-Dilworth, entrepreneur and investor, joined by his science-focused marketing and communications consultancy, JDI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elisa New, Director of Poetry in America and the Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature at Harvard University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drew Hamlin, Software Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fraser Howie, Author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Steele will remain as Nautilus’ Publisher and Editorial Director. Kevin Berger will take the helm as Editor-in-Chief and Michael Segal will be Editor-at-Large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable contributors to Nautilus have included: Scott Aaronson, Amanda Gefter, Martin Rees, Lisa Randall, Robert Sapolsky, Hope Jahren, Nicholas Carr, Sylvia Earl, Carl Zimmer, B.J. Novak, Alan Lightman, and Cormac McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proposed deal gives Nautilus the resources it needs to continue to support the same kind of vibrant, original writing and reporting that has differentiated it from the very beginning,” said Steele. “Like our staff, contributors, partners and advisors, our new ownership group will be in it for the long haul, and for all the right reasons. Together we will work even harder to expand the public’s knowledge and understanding of fundamental questions of scientific inquiry, as well as their connection to human culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2013, Nautilus was the first magazine ever to win two National Magazine Awards in its first year of eligibility. It also won the Webby for best science website, two AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards, was named one of the World’s Best-Designed news sites by the Society for News Design, and has enjoyed dozens of other honors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Science needs all of the love it can get. It deserves everything we have to give,” said Jones-Dilworth. “We want everyone to understand the fundamental scientific questions of our day, and appreciate how advances both large and small positively impact daily life. All of us in the proposed ownership group share this drive. Nautilus is essential today. If you’re not already a subscriber, you really need to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nautilus is currently a project of NautilusThink, a New York not-for-profit corporation, which will continue to run programs to advance interest in the sciences following the proposed acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the proposed acquisition, Nautilus also published a public letter titled “Science Matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter is a public commitment by the Nautilus team, its staff, advisors, and its contributors; leading thinkers, researchers, teachers, and businesspeople; and the public at large to tirelessly advance the cause of science in America and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone and everyone is encouraged to read the letter, add their name, and share it with their community at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/blog/celebrating-science-co_sign-the-letter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://nautil.us/blog/celebrating-science-co_sign-the-letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Nautilus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nautilus is science, connected. Online, in print and in the classroom, Nautilus challenges the reader to consider the deep, mysterious connecting tissue that runs through the sciences and connects them to philosophy, culture, and art. It reminds us that we are all interested in the same narratives as human beings: Who are we, what is the world we find ourselves in, and where does meaning come from? Nautilus make subtexts, hidden meanings, and fundamental truths shine through narrative that challenges the usual boundaries in science media and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nautilus lets science spill over its usual borders. Learn more at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://nautil.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thank You, Guido</title>
<link>https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/thank-you--guido</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/thank-you--guido</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After six and a half years, Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, is leaving Dropbox and heading into retirement. From the beginning, we knew Guido would be a great addition to our company. In fact, his contributions to Dropbox date back to day one. Our CEO Drew Houston’s very first lines of code for Dropbox were written in Python.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I love about Python is it just works,” says Houston. “It is so intuitive and beautifully designed. A lot of these attributes inspired my co-founder Arash and me when we thought about the design ethos for Dropbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guido’s first meeting with Drew was in 2011, when they had lunch together after being introduced by a former colleague. Guido then gave various talks at Dropbox, where he got to meet many engineers who were fans of Python. At the time, both the Dropbox server and desktop client software were written almost exclusively in Python. Although Python was released nearly 30 years ago, it is still widely popular today and becoming one of the world’s most popular programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here was a company where everything they did was Python,” said van Rossum. “So whichever part of the codebase I would be interested in, I knew I would be enjoying myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2013, Guido &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/12/welcome-guido/&quot;&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; Dropbox. Since then, he has not only made contributions to Python at Dropbox, but also left an everlasting impact on our engineering culture and our people. It started with some of the young engineers Guido met early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a small number of really smart, really young coders who produced a lot of very clever code that only they could understand,” said van Rossum. “That is probably the right attitude to have when you're a really small startup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the company grew, new engineers who joined couldn’t understand the code. Clever code is usually short and cryptic, written by and for the individual who came up with it, but is hard for anyone else to understand—and nearly impossible to maintain. Guido called this “cowboy coding culture”. He recognized its value in our early stages of trying to implement things quickly, but knew it wouldn’t be sustainable over time, so he decided to speak up in his own quiet way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When asked, I would give people my opinion that maintainable code is more important than clever code,” he said. “If I encountered clever code that was particularly cryptic, and I had to do some maintenance on it, I would probably rewrite it. So I led by example, and also by talking to other people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guido also had a big impact on our development organization by increasing engineers’ confidence in their testing culture. The team used continuous integration, which means every time a change to the code was submitted, a series of tests would run to make sure there were no problems with the new code. A lot of times the tests would fail, but half of those times, it was just a bad test. Two engineers in particular noticed that how rarely the engineers would actually try to understand why the test was broken. As a way to improve the process, Guido joined their team to help fix all the broken tests (or delete them if they couldn't be fixed) and develop internal tools so that people who owned the tests could actually have an understanding of why it was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guido then switched teams and started working on mypy, now one of the most popular static type checkers for Python, written by a Dropboxer that he had helped hire during his first year here, Jukka Lehtosalo. Mypy started off as Jukka’s Ph.D. research project, and started to develop into something more when Jukka met Guido at a Python conference in Santa Clara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I talked to Guido about what I’d been building and also why I was doing this,” said Lehtosalo. “And turns out, Guido had been thinking about similar problems himself, but he hadn’t actually implemented anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, Guido invited Jukka to visit Dropbox and interview for a job, which he took in 2013. For a year, mypy continued to be a research prototype as Jukka worked on other projects. Then during Hack Week 2014, Guido helped Jukka with testing out mypy as a real use case with Python at Dropbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was really important because it was the seed that started it all,” said Lehtosalo. “Previously, mypy was separate from Python, but now we were trying to make it an official standard, as a part of Python. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2015, Guido formed the mypy team, and for the last four years, he and Jukka have been working closely together to continue its development. The result of this is nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/09/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python/&quot;&gt;four million lines of checked Python code&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 200,000 improved type definitions, and countless hours saved for engineers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mypy was one of the projects Guido spent a lot of his time on, he also cared deeply about making engineering culture, both at Dropbox and in the Python community, more inclusive for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I was born feminist,” said van Rossum. “My mother imbued me with solid feminist ideals. I kept that up and I've observed things like how there aren't a lot of women engineers in the Python core development team. In the early days, all the Unix hackers were almost all guys. There were few women who hung out with us, and it took me a while before I realized how small that percentage was. I just started becoming more interested specifically in the topic of women in STEM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Dropbox, Guido has attended diversity-focused events and mentored women engineers. One of those mentees is Sushma Yadlapalli, who is on the Information Technology Services team at Dropbox. She met Guido through an internal mentoring program for engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought it would be great to have a mentor to help with my Python skills,” Yadlapalli said. “I’d been wanting to get back to open source because I really like the Python community. I think it’s a great place. So I filled out the form and I hit submit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several days later, Sushma received an email saying she had been matched with Guido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘Am I reading this correctly?’ And then I showed it to one of my teammates, and being like, ‘Did I get this right?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last several months, Guido and Sushma have been meeting once a week to talk about all things programming. But Sushma says the biggest takeaways were not just about how to do things, but how to become more confident and learn how to figure things out on your own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My experience with him has been incredibly kind,” she said. “He would never invalidate anything I said or asked, and made me feel empowered. He’s incredibly down to earth. I think at his core, Guido is a person who is trying to help make the world better in his own way. I think that was his philosophy when he started programming in Python and mentoring women is just another way that he contributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Guido is officially retiring, his contributions to Dropbox and the larger Python community will continue to be felt. He has already put into motion the conversion of the Dropbox server code from Python 2 to Python 3. And even though he’s already stepped down from his fancifully named Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) title, he will always have a spot in the Python community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Guido has been able to foster a community where things are friendly and welcoming,” says Lehtosalo. “I hope he continues to follow the Python community because he is such a big part of it. My guess though is even though he’s retiring from Dropbox, he’s not officially retiring from the Python community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's been an amazing ride to see this little hack of mine affect so many people in their lives,” says van Rossum. “I’m humbled to get all this fan mail from people who say Python is the best thing that has ever happened to them and that it changed their lives. It all started by being very open to peoples' contributions and encouraging people to help themselves often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so grateful to have had Guido as a part of the Dropbox family, and we wish him the best in his retirement. Thank you, Guido! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The SpaceX Starship is a big deal</title>
<link>https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/29/the-spacex-starship-is-a-very-big-deal/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/29/the-spacex-starship-is-a-very-big-deal/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/17/blog-series-countering-misconceptions-in-space-journalism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;series on common misconceptions in space journalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has been working on some variant of the Big Falcon Rocket for almost a decade, with a publicly announced architecture for three years. The target performance figures are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spacex.com/starship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Starship website&lt;/a&gt;, endlessly dissected on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/cxyt8x/starship_development_thread_5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=72.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NASA spaceflight forums&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqgSVV36wNI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;livestream of construction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet none of the oft-published mainstream articles seem to capture the magnitude of the vision that Starship embodies. Starship prompts superlatives, but by the end of this post the reader will understand not only how big Starship is, but also that it’s as small as it can possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48953946911_e60c5bcc5c_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image result for starship&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Starship was first unveiled as BFR/BFS at the IAC in 2016, the rocket has undergone a number of design changes. Together with Elon’s rather cryptic statement that the hardest part of the Starship design process was understanding exactly what question it would answer, we have a golden opportunity to employ &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/15/on-reasoning-backwards-from-architecture-to-implicit-requirements/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reasoning backwards from design to implicit requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a quick recap of the essential numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is the upper stage vehicle. It has a dry mass of 200 T, a fuel/ox mass of 1200 T, and a nominal payload of 150 T. Combined with high performance methane-oxygen vacuum engines, Starship is capable of over 7 km/s of Δv, which is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is boosted for Earth launch by Super Heavy, which is capable of lifting Starship to about 4 km/s before returning to the launch pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both stages are designed to be fully reusable, enabling both high reliability and very cheap launch cost. Indeed, the marginal cost per flight could fall to $5m or below, reducing launch costs to the neighborhood of $35/kg, or 1000x less than Shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, it wasn’t immediately apparent how SpaceX intended to fund Starship development, but by 2017 the development team seemed to have an answer. Even though Starship has a launch capability greater than any other rocket ever built, its launch cost is comparable to the smallest launch vehicles currently in service, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(rocket)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If flights were sold at the going rate, Starship could launch any payload currently in the market, while making money. In practice, of course, Starship will aggregate launches to spread cost, but it still was not entirely clear how Starship would not saturate the global launch market immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX clearly intends to build dozens of Starships. With an eventual flight rate of once per day per Starship, we’re looking at roughly a million tonnes to orbit per year. That exceeds the current launch market of about 500 T/year by a substantial margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, there is an answer to this question in the form of Starlink, SpaceX’s communication constellation. In 2012, SpaceX realized that their customers, primarily communications satellite operators, had better margins than they, the launch provider, did. And this was despite the generally usurious launch costs prevalent in the industry. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/27/there-are-no-known-commodity-resources-in-space-that-could-be-sold-on-earth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;space mining&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/space-based-solar-power-is-not-a-thing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;solar power&lt;/a&gt;, space-based communications satellites fulfill a genuine market need. If satellite manufacturers can make money launching $100m satellites on $100m rockets, how much money could SpaceX make launching their own satellites for much, much less? More on this in a future post, but in short, SpaceX believes (correctly) that there is almost infinite upside to flying satellites to meet global telecommunications demand, provided you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/lunar-exploration-architectures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;monopoly on launches that are orders of magnitude cheaper than the competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the money question out of the way, we can ask ourselves: What is Starship for? SpaceX could make plenty of money with incremental improvements on the Falcon launchers, and even build up Starlink without Starship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is for building nations in space. I don’t mean Project Artemis or some version of “The Martian,” though Starship could easily do both. I mean serious logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Starship atmospheric test prototypes are deep into construction, and I still routinely hear space visionaries adapting old exploration architectures for Starship. With a Starship or two, they say, I could build a really sweet Moon mission. With a Starship or two, I could upgrade the space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think bigger. Much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 10 years, Starship flights will be sold by the dozen. Starship is only cheap if it gets used as much as possible. The only meaningful barrier to production today is engine manufacture, and that will be through the hardest part of the learning curve well before commercial flights begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about how to use Starship, we can’t analogize to Christopher Columbus or Captain Cook. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/15/in-space-no-one-can-reason-by-analogy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;let’s avoid analogies entirely&lt;/a&gt;. But if you must use an analogy, think instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade#Decision_for_an_airlift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Berlin Airlift&lt;/a&gt;. In 1948, allied forces in Berlin were blockaded by Soviets to force capitulation and withdrawal. Instead, the remnants of the demobilized airforces began shipping in food, coal, and other supplies in 3.5 T (and later 10 T) increments – the cargo limits of the available planes. Daily demand was 5,000-10,000 T as the city neared winter, but the operation scaled rapidly. Over 15 months, 278,000 flights moved 2.3 million tonnes of cargo into the city, breaking the blockade. The Berlin Airlift functioned as a virtual conveyor belt, moving cargo from one point to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is a cargo conveyor system. The Starship is comparable in complexity to a 737, and so it’s not unthinkable to have a construction rate of 500/year. If each Starship manages 300 flights per year, each carrying 150 T of cargo, then we are talking a yearly incremental cargo capacity growth of 22 million tonnes to orbit. At this point, the most meaningful constraint on launch capacity might be launch pad construction rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all this cargo will be bread and cheese. In fact, by mass around 90% will simply be more methane and oxygen to refuel the LEO-parked cargo-laden Starships for flights to more distant destinations. Much of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2018/09/03/how-to-industrialize-mars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;remainder will be heavy industrial equipment&lt;/a&gt; as the purpose of these missions is to replicate the industrial stack of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will these missions work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Starship mission profile is somewhat dependent on destination. Starship is designed to be a versatile cargo vehicle, capable of landing on any terrestrial body in the solar system, but the details vary somewhat. The destinations I’ll cover here include Earth, Moon, Mars, and deep space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Starships will land on Earth than any other planet. In fact, for each Starship loaded to the gills with cargo and launched to LEO, another eight or so are needed to completely refill its tanks for further flights. Each of these Starship tankers will transfer fuel directly (&lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/there-are-no-gas-stations-in-space/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;there are no gas stations in space&lt;/a&gt;) and then return to the launch site for another load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship has a superficial resemblance to the Space Shuttle, with its stubby delta wings. Unlike Shuttle, however, these wings provide no lift, and they hinge along the body. Starship is designed to control its entry using differential drag, much like a sky diver. It can angle its body to produce a small amount of body lift necessary to avoid sharp deceleration and heating in the lower atmosphere. Unlike Shuttle, which glided subsonically to an absurdly long runway, Starship will relight its core engines, turn around, and execute a propulsive pinpoint landing. Just like a futuristic spaceship should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vRPrLvVaQq8?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Earth’s atmosphere is nice and thick, Starship can slow down to perhaps 150 mph before lighting its engines, requiring only a tiny amount of fuel to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon is a different story. Unlike Earth or Mars, it lacks an atmosphere so requires propulsive landing and the fuel to slow down from orbit. Despite this drawback, which in alternative architectures requires multiple stages to execute, Starship has an enormous Δv and can fly significant cargo from LEO to the Lunar surface and back to LEO, all without refueling on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is vitally important. While converting Lunar water to rocket fuel is all the rage right now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/lunar-water-is-not-that-exciting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it won’t be available for early missions, if ever&lt;/a&gt;. Oxidizer would perhaps be easier to obtain and, being 4/5 of the fuel weight, more worthwhile. Nonetheless, this graph shows how a Starship, refueled in LEO and optionally boosted to GTO, could transport 150 T of cargo the Moon and still have ample fuel to bring another 100 T of cargo back. A LEO-GTO refilling operation would require 15 tanker flights, and would take about a week to execute from TLI burn to Earth return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the baseline Starship architecture is capable of moving enormous quantities of cargo to anywhere on the Moon with little to no preplaced infrastructure. Assuming a $35/kg LEO launch cost, cargo could be delivered to the moon for perhaps $500/kg. This sounds like a lot, especially when the cost of shipping anything in a container, anywhere on Earth, is about $0.10/kg. But $500/kg is comparable to the cost of specialty industrial equipment, which is a decent baseline for the cost of Lunar-customized gear. In other words, for the first time in any Lunar mission reference architecture, the shipping cost could be a minority of total costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s consider Mars. Mars is the underlying design case for the Starship, although Starships that go to Mars will probably be of a customized nature. While the Moon takes about 3 days to get to, Mars takes 4-10 months. Launch windows to Mars only open every 2 years, so even if Elon has 1000 Starships ready to go, they can only go every 2 years. If there is copious fuel available on Mars, they could potentially return in time for the next launch window, but even so, 2 years is an awfully long time to wait for a reusable vehicle that depends on high flight rate. Starship needs to refuel on Mars from locally-produced methane and oxygen to return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economics shift here so much that some people even advocate employing Starship as an upper stage alone. Under this model, Starship would boost some Mars-bound payload onto the appropriate orbit, then turn around and come back to Earth, ready to fire off another payload as soon as it was refueled, perhaps a week later. Such a system could employ a given Starship 100 times as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why staging off Starship is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that Starships are not fundamentally scarce. By the time we are launching thousands of people to Mars every launch window, there will be so many Starships we’ll be giving them away. There may not be much point in flying them all back to Earth, but a few will return to bring people who want to come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and most important, reason is that Starship is not just a huge fuel tank and some kick ass engines, it’s also a Mars landing system. It turns out that landing on Mars is really hard. Of 17 attempted landings, only 8 have been successful, all built by JPL. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwh3HEdQyGI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Here’s a great explainer of the general problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the atmosphere is really thin. Thick enough to cause a thermal and guidance problem, but not thick enough to slow the spacecraft down enough, especially if it’s a really big (&amp;gt;2 T) lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mars Direct&lt;/a&gt; originally called for a blunt aeroshell and parachute landing system, but such a system has several fundamental issues. First, the aeroshell produces inadequate levels of lift, greatly restricting landing sites to very low altitude areas that aren’t downrange of mountains. Second, the aeroshell’s low lift causes the spacecraft to experience a very high G loading, potentially at levels that would incapacitate a human crew. Third, parachutes have proven very tricky to get right on Mars even for rover-sized payloads. Parachutes are problematic because a) their mass scales much faster than their size and b) their opening speed reduces as their size increases. Well below the size needed to be useful for human landers, parachutes weigh too much and open much too slowly to successfully arrest a lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is a solution and Starship leverages that solution. By bringing the spacecraft in sideways, the vehicle maximizes its area and lift, reducing g loading and ballistic coefficient. It can also perform a guided entry and precision rocket landing. Starship is not just a huge fuel tank and some kick ass engines, it’s also a reusable honest-to-god Mars landing system for &amp;gt;100T payloads that doesn’t require any parachutes. This is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Starship is designed to enable the rapid construction of an enormous, self-sufficient Mars city with a population measured in the millions. This can’t be done by analogy with western pioneer expansion in the USA. 20 acres and mule isn’t enough to survive on Mars. Mars is a deady adversarial environment and humans need copious advanced technology and production capacity to survive. Mars city building isn’t about Mark Watney lovingly raising 500 sqft of potatoes in his hab. Mars city building is about robots building potato farming robots and humans facilitating a nearly-automated industrial stack. Mars city building is about tenting and pressurizing 10,000 sqft of the Martian surface, per person. Mars city building is about maintaining an exponential growth curve for 6 orders of magnitude. It’s an enormous logistical enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the optimal size for Mars Starships? It turns out that the practical limitation for Mars Starships is set by entry, descent, and landing. Without &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/atmospheres-and-terraforming/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;terraforming the atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, tops out at somewhere around 1000 T of cargo. Still, a 1000 T cargo Starship would be 25m wide and perhaps 70m tall. The 150 T Starship (the current version) is just barely viable for Mars cargo missions, but useful for proving out the architecture, testing the systems, and getting things started. Fortunately, welded stainless steel is much easier to increase in diameter than virtually any other rocket manufacturing technique. This is what I mean when I say that while Starship is bigger than any of our other puny rockets, it’s actually quite small compared to the magnitude of its destined task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, deep space, by which I mean any destination that isn’t a major planet or moon. Starship’s pressurized volume is about double that of the International Space Station. A space station built from Starships, its tanks converted to habitable space and equipped with electric thrusters, could be used for any imaginable purpose. Earth orbit space station? Asteroid exploration? Deep space telescope chassis? Outer solar system exploration? I’ve written before that &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/06/26/are-modular-space-stations-cost-effective/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;modular space stations are not cost effective&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps what we need are fewer, much larger modules. After all, there’s nothing cheaper than developing a new heavy lift rocket!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish this post, I’m going to revisit its starting point. Starship is still seen by many in the space media community as a slightly overgrown version of any other rocket, with reusability tacked on. This is an error of analogy. Starship fundamentally changes our relationship with space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is a devastatingly powerful space access and logistical transport mechanism that will instantly crush the relevance of every other rocket ever built.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is Stack Exchange in violation of NY labor law by using volunteer moderators?</title>
<link>https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/337117/16587</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/337117/16587</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not a lawyer or a legal scholar, so I'm going to ignore the exact legal prescriptions and instead explore the spirit of the law. How much are moderators like employees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasks that moderators do are tasks that moderators could be paid for: handling complaints (typically submitted via flags), handling support requests (typically submitted via meta), performing tasks that others cannot do after verifying that the action is warranted (editing, closing, reopening, deleting, …), providing guidance and leadership to the community (again typically via meta), etc. Community managers do those tasks as part of their paid job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators never have any obligation to work on a particular schedule. Moderators do not have any obligation to work, withone significant exception: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/287878/should-stack-overflow-moderators-have-a-standard-of-duty&quot;&gt;moderators on Stack Overflow are expected to spend a minimum of time&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not aware that this has ever been enforced, but it's possible that some SO mods who stood down voluntarily because they couldn't keep up with the expected level of activity would have remained if there hadn't been any pressure for them to maintain a high level of activity. Even with this caveat, in terms of obligation to perform, moderators are different from employees, who have to work when the employer requires it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderation is more of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38930048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;gig&lt;/a&gt;. The legal status of paid contractors is a point of legal and political debate in many jurisdictions. Regardless of whether habitual contractors should be treated like employees, they always expect to be paid for completed work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what moderators do can be considered work. Do moderators work &lt;em&gt;as directed by the company&lt;/em&gt;? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&quot;&gt;moderator agreement&lt;/a&gt; — which has no legal force, since it isn't a contract (the most that Stack Exchange can do if they don't like what a moderator did is dismiss the moderator, and they legally can do that even if the moderator hasn't violated the agreement) — states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will abide by the then-current Terms of Service of $SITENAME, and other moderator policies made available to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) I acknowledge and agree that I am an independent volunteer moderator to $SITENAME and I am not an employee, agent or representative of Stack Exchange Inc., and I have no authority to bind Stack Exchange Inc. in any manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These statements do not fully characterize moderatorship on Stack Exchange. Moderators are not only expected to &lt;em&gt;abide by&lt;/em&gt; the terms of service and other policies, but also to &lt;em&gt;enforce&lt;/em&gt; certain policies, such as the code of conduct. Moderators do not have &lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt; to speak on behalf of the company, but they are often &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; to do so. Moderators are go-betweens, representing the company to the community and representing the community to the company. While moderators have considerable latitude in how they apply directives from the company, the company sets the boundaries. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336364/what-does-the-code-of-conduct-say-about-pronouns/336367#336367&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a moderator, you're held to a higher standard and are expected to set a positive example for your community. (…) After that, if you cannot in good conscience follow it, reach out so we can find a replacement for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are situations in which you cannot be a moderator and do nothing. Specific performance is expected. The only punishment is dismissal — but if an employee fails to perform as directed, the punishment is rarely worse than dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for everyone, but for my part a major reason why I &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1650/i-am-resigning-as-a-moderator&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt;¹ was because I was in some respects an agent of the company. This doesn't by itself imply a subordination relationship: I would have reacted in the same way if I'd been a member of a non-profit organization that had done something unconscionable and I'd lost any hope or interest of changing the organization from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to another criterion: are moderators purely subordinates of the company, or are they to some extent participants in decision making? Here the answer is very clear: moderators don't have a say. The company decides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, who benefits from the work of moderators? That's a bit hard to delimit. There are benefits to the world in general, to the community in particular and benefits to the company. The world benefits because the repository of knowledge is better curated. The community benefits because moderators wield some of the tools that make it work and serve a social function to regulate the community. The company benefits because moderators are effectively delegates of the company: the company could hire enough moderators to cover the work that moderators do, but doesn't thanks to the volunteer moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can speak for pretty much all current and former moderators in saying that the reason we do or did this is to benefit the world and the community, not the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;are moderators similar to employees? To some extent.&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly enough that there is no clear-cut yes or no answer. There may be a clear-cut answer within the scope of a specific law, but I'm looking beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;I never expected to be paid and I would not have been a moderator for pay&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm sure that the former is true for all of us and the latter is true for most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid moderators would have a very different relationship with the community. Even though moderators are sometimes perceived as agents of the company, they are first and foremost community members. A monetary relationship would destroy this. Having moderators who are and remain from the community is important for community cohesion and for the health of the community. People who face the same problems that other community members are facing are more likely to take decisions that benefit the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderators should be giggers, but giggers on behalf of their community, which is itself a volunteer endeavor. The current status is that moderators are giggers on behalf of both their community and the company. This creates ambiguity which is detrimental to everyone: to the company (who may have legal and financial obligations that it hadn't bargained for), to the moderators (who face conflicting responsibilities when the interests of the company diverge from the interests of the community), and to the community (because moderators cannot fully act on their behalf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This needs to change. &lt;strong&gt;The governance of Stack Exchange needs to change&lt;/strong&gt;. We need to distinguish the &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; (the servers, the software), managed by a for-profit company, from the &lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt; (the content, the moderation), managed by a non-profit. And then &lt;strong&gt;moderators would be volunteering for a non-profit organization&lt;/strong&gt;, which carries no expectation of pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ &lt;sub&gt;Background: I was a moderator for over 8 years, across 5 different low- to moderate-activity sites (1 to 3 at a time).&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;4f84&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em hr gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;“XML, really? It’s bloated and outdated. Why not use JSON? It’s the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c7a9&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;These comments imply that JSON is the “one true file format” that should be used for everything, but we don’t believe there’s such a thing. Each format makes tradeoffs in encoding, flexibility, and expressiveness to best suit a specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;1b86&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hs ht hu&quot;&gt;A format optimized for size will use a binary encoding that won’t be human-readable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d06d&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;In addition to the intrinsic properties of a format, external factors can influence its practical use cases, such as the popularity of the format among the target developers, or library support in the desired programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4deb&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;When choosing a file format to use in a software project, software engineers pick the one with the best balance of features and external factors for the situation. This post is the first in a 3-part series examining the decision process we used to choose XML over JSON as the format at the core of Hyperview. In part 1, we focus on the suitability of each format for defining user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;0ec6&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Both XML and JSON can represent complex nested data structures, but they excel at different types of structures. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;JSON’s origins&lt;/a&gt; as a subset of JavaScript can be seen with how easily it represents key/value object data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, optimizes for document tree structures, by cleanly separating node data (attributes) from child data (elements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;912e&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;We can illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each format by using both formats to represent two types of data: lists and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;39c5&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ax ay iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja&quot;&gt;Example 1: List of users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ea7f&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz jb hb jc hd jd hf je hh jf hj&quot;&gt;Let’s represent a list of users. Each user has a first and last name, and a list of favorite movies. In JSON, there’s a sensible way to model this data: as an array of objects with keys for the user properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;fa23&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;[&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Michael&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Scott&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;favorite_movies&quot;: [ &quot;Diehard&quot;, &quot;Threat Level Midnight&quot; ]&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Dwight&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Schrute&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;favorite_movies&quot;: [ &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; ]&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Pam&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Beesly&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;favorite_movies&quot;: [ &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; ]&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;48c5&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;A particular strength of JSON is its support for nested data structures. Notice that the list of movies can be easily represented using an array value for the &lt;em class=&quot;hr&quot;&gt;favorite_movies&lt;/em&gt; key. In XML, however, element attributes must be strings. This means there’s no officially supported way to represent the list of movies in an element attribute. We can hack this by encoding the list into an attribute using a comma delimiter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;c779&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Users&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&lt;br/&gt;first=&quot;Michael&quot;&lt;br/&gt;last=&quot;Scott&quot;&lt;br/&gt;favoriteMovies=&quot;Diehard, Threat Level Midnight&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&lt;br/&gt;first=&quot;Dwight&quot;&lt;br/&gt;last=&quot;Schrute&quot;&lt;br/&gt;favoriteMovies=&quot;The Crow, Wedding Crashers&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&lt;br/&gt;first=&quot;Pam&quot;&lt;br/&gt;last=&quot;Beesly&quot;&lt;br/&gt;favoriteMovies=&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Users&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;94c3&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;This solution is not ideal. We’re not using XML semantics to represent the list of movies, meaning we can’t rely on XML syntax validation to verify the data. The clients reading the data will need to know how to split on commas and unescape the data in this particular attribtue. So both writing and reading the data is error-prone. To address these shortcomings, we should use XML syntax to represent the list of movies. This means creating child elements for each movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;7063&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Users&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User first=&quot;Michael&quot; last=&quot;Scott&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Diehard&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Threat Level Midnight&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User first=&quot;Dwight&quot; last=&quot;Schrute&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;The Crow&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Wedding Crashers&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User first=&quot;Pam&quot; last=&quot;Beesly&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Legally Blonde&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Users&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5dc8&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;With this approach, we avoid the hack of using a comma delimiter in an attribute. However, we’ve created another problem in the form of inconsistency: some user properties are represented as element attributes, others as child elements. The client has to know to look in both places to get all of the user’s data. To be consistent, we can represent all user properties as child elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;e2ff&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Users&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FirstName&amp;gt;Michael&amp;lt;/FirstName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;LastName&amp;gt;Scott&amp;lt;/LastName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Diehard&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Threat Level Midnight&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FirstName&amp;gt;Dwight&amp;lt;/FirstName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;LastName&amp;gt;Schrute&amp;lt;/LastName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;The Crow&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Wedding Crashers&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FirstName&amp;gt;Pam&amp;lt;/FirstName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;LastName&amp;gt;Beesly&amp;lt;/LastName&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt;Legally Blonde&amp;lt;/Movie&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/FavoriteMovies&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Users&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7717&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Now we have a consistent, extensible representation for a list of users in XML. But compared to the same data in JSON, this representation is overly verbose and hard to write. The XML syntax obscures the structure of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e9bc&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;So JSON is well-suited for representing lists of objects with complex properties. JSON’s key/value object syntax makes it easy. By contrast, XML’s attribute syntax only works for simple data types. Using child elements to represent complex properties can lead to inconsistencies or unnecessary verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;50b8&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ax ay iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja&quot;&gt;Example 2: Org Chart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e7e7&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz jb hb jc hd jd hf je hh jf hj&quot;&gt;XML may not be ideal to represent generic data structures, but it excels at representing one particular structure: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)).&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; By separating node data (attributes) from parent/child relationships, the tree structure of the data shines through, and the code to process the data can be quite elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0028&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;A classic example of a tree structure is a company org chart. Let’s assume each node in the tree is an employee, with a name and title. The edges in the tree represent a reporting relationship. The root of the tree is the boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ace3&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;In JSON, we represent each employee as an object with key/value pairs for the name and title. But JSON doesn’t provide a separate notation for relationships vs attributes, so we must also use a key/value pair to represent an employee’s direct reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6fe8&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Notice that it’s hard to distinguish a node’s properties from the relationships. It’s common to prefix the relationship keys with “$” or “_” to make the distinction clearer, but this is a hack akin to using a delimiter in an XML attribute. When writing the JSON, we can cause errors by forgetting the prefix. Likewise when reading the JSON, we can’t loop through the keys in an object without remembering to filter out the ones starting with the prefix. Both reading and writing the data is now error-prone and inelegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1c74&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;XML really shines when it comes to tree data: elements are nodes, attributes are node properties, and child elements imply the reporting relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;fe6c&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Michael Scott&quot; title=&quot;Regional Manager&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Dwight Schrute&quot; title=&quot;Ass. Regional Mgr&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Jim Halpert&quot; title=&quot;Head of Sales&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Andy Bernard&quot; title=&quot;Sales Rep&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Phyllis Lapin&quot; title=&quot;Sales Rep&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Employee&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Pam Beesly&quot; title=&quot;Office Administrator&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Employee&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3a44&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Compared to the JSON example, it’s much easier to get a sense of the underlying structure of the data. Attributes of the employee (name and title) are cleanly separated from the employee relationships. The relationships are both easier to visualize when writing the file, and the code to read the data can operate on the overall structure without touching node properties. There’s no chance of accidentally interpreting the relationship data as an employee attribute like in the JSON example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c962&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;The advantages of XML over JSON for trees becomes more pronounced when we introduce different node types. Assume we wanted to introduce departments into the org chart above. In XML, we can just use an element with a new tag name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;810a&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Department name=&quot;Scranton Branch&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Michael Scott&quot; title=&quot;Regional Manager&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Department name=&quot;Sales&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Dwight Schrute&quot; title=&quot;Ass. Regional Mgr&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Jim Halpert&quot; title=&quot;Head of Sales&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Andy Bernard&quot; title=&quot;Sales Rep&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Phyllis Lapin&quot; title=&quot;Sales Rep&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Employee&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Department&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Employee name=&quot;Pam Beesly&quot; title=&quot;Office Administrator&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Employee&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/Department&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eb2d&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;JSON doesn’t have a concept of node types, so again we need to introduce a new special prefixed key to represent the type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;ga gb gc gd ge jg jh dl&quot;&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;6a0a&quot; class=&quot;ip ib em bk ji b fe jj jk r jl&quot;&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;department&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Scranton Branch&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Michael Scott&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Regional Manager&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$reports&quot;: [&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;department&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Sales&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$reports&quot;: {&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Dwight Schrute&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Assistant to the Regional Manager&quot;&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Jim Halpert&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Head of Sales&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$reports&quot;: [&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Andy Bernard&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sales Rep&quot;&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Phyllis Lapin&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sales Rep&quot;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;$type&quot;: &quot;employee&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Pam Beesly&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Office Administrator&quot;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f8ac&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Now it’s JSON’s turn to be bloated and hard-to-read. Meanwhile, the XML version represents the tree data succinctly without obscuring the underlying structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1fdc&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;These two examples highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of JSON and XML when representing different types of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;d4e8&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hs ht hu&quot;&gt;JSON excels at representing a collection of homogenous objects, where object properties can be composite data types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;c1dc&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz hv hb hw hd hx hf hy hh hz hj hs ht hu&quot;&gt;XML excels at representing trees with heterogeneous objects, where object properties are simple data types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8058&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz jb hb jc hd jd hf je hh jf hj&quot;&gt;Hyperview’s goal is to bring a web-like development experience to mobile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;e0f3&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hs ht hu&quot;&gt;On the web, a server responds to an HTTP request with HTML/CSS to render a web page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;25c9&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz hv hb hw hd hx hf hy hh hz hj hs ht hu&quot;&gt;In Hyperview, a server responds to an HTTP request with a response to render a mobile app screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;b762&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;In order to fill the role of HTML/CSS for mobile apps, Hyperview’s file format must be able to define the layout and structure of an app screen’s UI.&lt;br/&gt;And component trees are the best way to represent UI layouts. Every major UI framework out there uses a component tree. Xcode even offers an exploded 3D view that really highlights the underlying tree structure of a screen: each component has a parent component, and everything rolls up to a shared root component.&lt;/p&gt;

3D view of the component tree in the Instawork app
&lt;p id=&quot;077d&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Trees are a powerful representation for UI layouts. They naturally provide component groupings, allowing designers and developers to use higher-level abstractions. When we need to hide, show, or animate a section of the screen, we don’t need to change the state of each component in the section. Rather, we can change the state of the single parent component that contains every UI element of the section. When modifying a component, we only need to worry about what’s in its subtree, and not what’s happening at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;


HTML, Android, React, and Hyperview all use XML syntax for UI layouts
&lt;p id=&quot;dd30&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;UI layouts are represented as component trees. And XML is ideal for representing tree structures. It’s a match made in heaven! In fact, the most popular UI frameworks in the world (HTML and Android) use XML syntax to define layouts. Still not convinced? Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, the popular JS library designed around composing UI components. If there was ever a library to embrace JSON for defining UI, it should be React, right? But the React website actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; defining component UI using JSX, an XML-like format. Even though using JSX requires learning a new non-JS syntax and adding a transpiling step to the build process, the library authors feel it’s worth the pain in order to use XML!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ffb7&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;As noted at the beginning, each data format comes with certain tradeoffs. Overall, the benefits of XML for Hyperview outweigh the downsides, we still need to handle those rough spots. In particular, we noted that XML element attributes cannot natively represent lists of data. This case occurs in Hyperview with how we apply &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyperview.org/docs/reference_view&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;styles to elements&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this limitation of XML, styles are represented as space-separated ids, and the ids cannot contain spaces. Luckily, this limitation matches the behavior of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;class attribute in HTML&lt;/a&gt;, so the approach is at least familiar to web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;49fb&quot; class=&quot;gw gx em bk gy b gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj&quot;&gt;Check outparts 2 and 3 of our exploration of XML and JSON in the context of Hyperview. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyperview.org/blog/2019/02/10/when-xml-beats-json-2&quot; class=&quot;fg cp hk hl hm hn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Part 2 covers the extensibility of JSON and XML&lt;/a&gt;, while Part 3 will compare the developer experience of both formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuevo movimiento en internet para &lt;strong&gt;bloquear a la plataforma independentista Tsunami Democràtic&lt;/strong&gt; y a su particular 'app'. Después de que un juez decidiese &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2019-10-19/el-juez-ordena-cerrar-la-aplicacion-de-tsunami-y-otras-webs-detectadas_2291300/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;bloquear sus direcciones web&lt;/a&gt;, obligando a sus gestores a migrar dominios y buscar nuevo alojamiento, ahora ha sido GitHub, el servicio propiedad de Microsoft desde junio de 2018, el que ha acabado por bloquear el acceso al repositorio que alojaba la web y la aplicación de la plataforma desde España.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La noticia ha saltado esta misma tarde cuando &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2019-10-22/anonymous-catalonia-tsunami-democratic-cdr-telegram-proces_2293039/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Anonymous Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;, uno de los grupos más activos desde que se conociera la sentencia del 'Procés', ha anunciado a través de su canal de Telegram que la compañía estadounidense había tumbado el acceso el repositorio de Tsunami desde nuestro país. Solo hace falta a acudir a uno de sus últimos enlaces de la web disponibles: &lt;a data-pjax=&quot;#js-repo-pjax-container&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/tsunamidemocratic/tsunamidemocratic.github.io&quot;&gt;tsunamidemocratic.github.io&lt;/a&gt; para ver que es cierto. &lt;strong&gt;En un mensaje de aviso escrito en inglés&lt;/strong&gt;, el sistema alerta de que &quot;el repositorio no está disponible en tu localización&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;related-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2018-06-04/microsoft-ahora-ama-el-software-libre-compra-la-startup-github-por-7-500-millones_1573704/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sign-related&quot;&gt;Teknautas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La compañía de Satya Nadella acaba de anunciar su acuerdo con una de las plataformas más potentes y más conocidas de la red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pese a que el servicio de 'software' libre estaba entre los objetivos de las autoridades por dar cobijo a la plataforma independentista, fuentes de Microsoft España han confirmado a Teknautas que ellos &lt;strong&gt;no han recibido ninguna petición por parte de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad&lt;/strong&gt; del Estado para cerrar los repositorios de Tsunami por lo que la decisión se ha tomado a nivel internacional. Este diario ha contactado con GitHub y Microsoft en sus sedes en EEUU, pero a la hora de publicar este artículo no habían enviado respuesta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aunque ni desde Telegram ni desde las cuentas oficiales de Tsunami Democràtic se han pronunciado sobre este asunto aún, distintos usuarios confirman en las redes sociales que usando una VPN que enmascare la procedencia de tu conexión &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/QJordiQ/status/1189192503506825216&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;es posible acceder sin ningún problema&lt;/a&gt;. Teknautas también ha podido corroborar este hecho accediendo a través del navegador Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto significa un paso más en la presión sobre la plataforma independentista en la red ya que ha sido un nuevo actor, esta vez GitHub, el que ha tomado cartas en el asunto, cortando las alas y complicado, en parte, &lt;strong&gt;la difusión tanto de su web como de su 'app'&lt;/strong&gt;. Eso sí, como ya explicamos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2019-10-18/tsunami-democratic-web-app-guardia-civil-barcelona_2290071/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;en un artículo anterior&lt;/a&gt;, censurar estos servicios y programas es casi imposible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;La muralla de Telegram&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ante la presión que estaban recibiendo por diferentes plataformas y servicios web, el propio Tsunami Democràtic decidió resguardarse hace unos días en el servicio que, de momento, más apoyo y réditos le ha dado: Telegram. Este programa de mensajería instantánea, creado por disidentes rusos y con sede en Dubái, se ha convertido en &lt;strong&gt;uno de los nombres clave de las protestas en Cataluña&lt;/strong&gt; y, al menos por ahora, en el mejor refugio para los independentistas en la red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A través de distintos canales han ido compartiendo información, movilizando y llamando a los manifestantes, y desde el 26 de octubre también comparten la 'app' de Tsunami usando sus servidores. La plataforma independentista abrió el pasado sábado un nuevo canal &lt;strong&gt;creado solo y para compartir la 'app' y hablar de novedades&lt;/strong&gt; y mejoras en el sistema. Así, han optado por alojar su APK en este programa por lo que si Telegram acaba por no tomar cartas en el asunto, a las autoridades les será harto complicado tumbar la difusión de la aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En cuanto a si anteriormente se han visto situaciones similares tanto en Github como en Telegram hay que decir que el segundo de estos servicios ha defendido en todo momento su neutralidad en estos casos incluso &lt;a href=&quot;https://telegra.ph/Dont-Shoot-the-Messenger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicando artículos defendiendo a ultranza sus principios&lt;/a&gt;. Solo actúan cuando hay &lt;strong&gt;delitos contra la propiedad intelectual&lt;/strong&gt; o casos muy extremos de &lt;a href=&quot;https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2015/11/19/la-aplicacion-telegram-bloqueo-78-cuentas-relacionadas-con-isis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yihadismo&lt;/a&gt; o similar. El caso de Github es algo diferente y es que hace solo unos meses se vivió un importante escándalo después de que el sistema optase por &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/github-ha-comenzado-a-bloquear-cuentas-desarrolladores-que-se-encuentran-paises-sancionados-eeuu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bloquear cuentas de países sancionados por EEUU&lt;/a&gt; e incluso cerrase repositorios de trabajadores chinos que se quejaban de sus situaciones laborales.&lt;/p&gt;
