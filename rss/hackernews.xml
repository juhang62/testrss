<title>Vitamin D Insufficiency is Prevalent in Severe Covid-19</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section abstract&quot; id=&quot;abstract-1&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;Background: COVID-19 is a major pandemic that has killed more than 196,000 people. The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: In an Institutional Review Board approved study performed at a single, tertiary care academic medical center, the medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. We determined the frequency of VDI among COVID-19 patients to evaluate the likelihood of a VDI-COVID-19 relationship. Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients with serum 25OHD levels were identified; 65.0% required ICU admission.The VDI prevalence in ICU patients was 84.6%, vs. 57.1% in floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. Coagulopathy was present in 62.5% of ICU COVID-19 patients, and 92.3% were lymphocytopenic. Conclusions: VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction. Thus, we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Insomnia Designer – Open-source collaborative editor for API design</title>
<link>https://insomnia.rest/blog/introducing-designer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://insomnia.rest/blog/introducing-designer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/download/designer/&quot;&gt;Insomnia Designer&lt;/a&gt; a new open-source desktop application that provides a modern workflow for teams to design and collaborate on APIs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a software developer, there's a good chance you interact with APIs almost every day. Since 2015, it's been Insomnia's goal to help make this process as simple and enjoyable as possible. Fast-forward to today and Insomnia is the leading open-source tool for interacting with REST and GraphQL APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction is only half the story, however, which is why &lt;strong&gt;we're pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/download/designer/&quot;&gt;Insomnia Designer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—a new application that focuses on improving the API design workflow that so many companies struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designer builds on top of the existing Insomnia (now Insomnia Core) codebase to facilitate a &quot;spec-first development&quot; workflow that allows you to design and edit OpenApi documents in one place, share them across your organization using Git, and interact with them using the Insomnia features you already know and love 💜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/images/blog/designer-screens.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/images/blog/designer-screens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Specifications Home&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first release contains a core set of features to edit and share OpenAPI specifications, with the intention of involving the community as soon as possible to help shape drive the app in the right direction. So, we encourage you to take it for a spin and &lt;strong&gt;submit any and all feedback to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Kong/insomnia&quot;&gt;Insomnia GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;, or join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.insomnia.rest&quot;&gt;Community Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feature Highlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/strong&gt; 🤗&lt;br/&gt;Designer is for developers and teams designing and creating APIs. Today, it's not uncommon for organizations to manage &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of APIs that span across teams and departments. Our plan is to make Designer into a platform developers can use to collaboratively design, review, test API specifications during the API development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I download it?&lt;/strong&gt; 🛒&lt;br/&gt;Designer is a free and open-source desktop application that can be installed on Mac, Windows, or Linux. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/downloads/&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; page to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why open source?&lt;/strong&gt; 💜&lt;br/&gt;Insomnia Core would not be where it is today without the help of the open-source community. We're using the same strategy for Designer in order to help make it as robust, full-featured, and adaptable as possible. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kong/insomnia/&quot;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a separate app?&lt;/strong&gt; 📦&lt;br/&gt;Insomnia is an extremely powerful tool, but most users love it for how simple and easy it is to use. In order to maintain this core tenet, Designer needs to be simple too, which is why we're releasing Insomnia Designer as a separate application, focused specifically on &lt;em&gt;API design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it support Insomnia Plus/Team accounts?&lt;/strong&gt; 💼&lt;br/&gt;Designer &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; currently integrate with existing Insomnia Plus/Team accounts, but we plan on adding support in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lyft lays off 17% of workforce, furloughs hundreds more</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/lyft-lays-off-17percent-of-workforce-furloughs-hundreds-more.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/lyft-lays-off-17percent-of-workforce-furloughs-hundreds-more.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;43.801195002716&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LYFT&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; is laying off 982 employees and furloughing 288 others in an effort to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the company announced Wednesday in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1759509/000119312520125193/d848949d8k.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft stock was up nearly 4% Wednesday afternoon, amid a broader market rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layoffs account for 17% of the workforce, Lyft said. Lyft also has implemented reductions in base salary for employees exempt from the layoffs and furloughs for a 12-week period. The salary cuts, which begin in May, will consist of a 30% reduction for executive leadership, 20% for vice presidents and 10% for all other exempt employees, Lyft said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is now clear that the Covid-19 crisis is going to have broad-reaching implications for the economy, which impacts our business. We have therefore made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team,&quot; Lyft CEO Logan Green said in a statement Wednesday. &quot;Our guiding principle for decision-making right now is to ensure we emerge from the crisis in the strongest possible position to achieve the company's mission.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft said it expects to incur $28 million to $36 million in restructuring and related charges from the layoffs, primarily related to employee severance and benefits. The company said the charges will mostly impact its second quarter. Lyft's board members will also forgo 30% of their cash compensation for the second quarter of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft's filing comes just a day after The Information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/uber-discusses-plan-to-lay-off-about-20-of-employees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lyft's rival &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UBER&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; is discussing laying off 20% of its staff. Uber declined to comment, but did say in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its long-time CTO resigned from the company. Rideshare companies have seen a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/02/uber-lyft-rideshare-businesses-drop-by-50percent-due-to-coronavirus-report.html&quot;&gt;drop in demand&lt;/a&gt; as the Covid-19 pandemic keeps Americans largely at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;--CNBC's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/deirdre-bosa/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deirdre Bosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I could do that in a weekend (2016)</title>
<link>https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;I could do that in a weekend!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;166.42690513219&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could do that in a weekend!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a single large software company that doesn't regularly draw internet comments of the form “What do all the employees do? I could build their product myself.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitquabit.com/post/one-which-i-call-out-hacker-news/&quot;&gt;Benjamin Pollack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-its-trivial/&quot;&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt; called out people who do that with Stack Overflow. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/03/29/stack-overflow-the-hardware-2016-edition/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow is relatively obviously lean&lt;/a&gt;, so the general response is something like “oh, sure maybe Stack Overflow is lean, but FooCorp must really be bloated”. And since most people have relatively little visibility into FooCorp, for any given value of FooCorp, that sounds like a plausible statement. After all, what product could possible require hundreds, or even thousands of engineers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, in the wake of the rapgenius SEO controversy, a number of folks called for someone to write a better Google. Alex Clemmer responded that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nullspace.io/building-search-engines.html&quot;&gt;maybe building a better Google is a non-trivial problem&lt;/a&gt;. Considering how much of Google's $500B market cap comes from search, and how much money has been spent by tens (hundreds?) of competitors in an attempt to capture some of that value, it seems plausible to me that search isn't a trivial problem. But in the comments on Alex's posts, multiple people respond and say that Lucene basically does the same thing Google does and that Lucene is poised to surpass Google's capabilities in the next few years. It's been long enough since then that we can look back and say that Lucene hasn't improved so much that Google is in danger from a startup that puts together a Lucene cluster. If anything, the cost of creating a viable competitor to Google search has gone up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For making a viable Google competitor, I believe that ranking is a harder problem than indexing, but even if we just look at indexing, there are individual domains that contain on the order of one trillion pages we might want to index (like Twitter) and I'd guess that we can find on the order a trillion domains. If you try to configure any off-the-shelf search index to hold an index of some number of trillions of items to handle a load of, say, 1/100th Google's load, with a latency budget of, say, 100ms (most of the latency should be for ranking, not indexing), I think you'll that this isn't trivial. And if you use Google to search Twitter, you can observe that, at least for select users or tweets, Google indexes Twitter quickly enough that it's basically real-time from the standpoint of users. Anyone who's tried to do real-time indexing with Lucene on a large corpus under high load will also find this to be non-trivial. You might say that this isn't totally fair since it's possible to find tweets that aren't indexed by major search engines, but if you want to make a call on what to index or not, well, that's also a problem that's non trivial in the general case. And we're only talking about indexing here, indexing is one of the easier parts of building a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses that actually care about turning a profit will spend a lot of time (hence, a lot of engineers) working on optimizing systems, even if an MVP for the system could have been built in a weekend. There's also a wide body of research that's found that decreasing latency has a signifiacnt effect on revenue over a pretty wide range of latencies for some businesses. Increasing performance also has the benefit of reducing costs. Businesses should keep adding engineers to work on optimization until the cost of adding an engineer equals the revenue gain plus the cost savings at the margin. This is often many more engineers than people realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just performance. Features also matter: when I talk to engineers working on basically any product at any company, they'll often find that there are seemingly trivial individual features that can add integer percentage points to revenue. Just as with performance, people underestimate how many engineers you can add to a product before engineers stop paying for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, features are often much more complex than outsiders realize. If we look at search, how do we make sure that different forms of dates and phone numbers give the same results? How about internationalization? Each language has unique quirks that have to be accounted for. In french, “l'foo” should often match “un foo” and vice versa, but American search engines from the 90s didn't actually handle that correctly. How about tokenizing Chinese queries, where words don't have spaces between them, and sentences don't have unique tokenizations? How about Japanese, where queries can easily contain four different alphabets? How about handling Arabic, which is mostly read right-to-left, except for the bits that are read left-to-right? &lt;a href=&quot;https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/part3&quot;&gt;And that's not even the most complicated part of handling Arabic&lt;/a&gt;! It's fine to ignore this stuff for a weekend-project MVP, but ignoring it in a real business means ignoring the majority of the market! Some of these are handled ok by open source projects, but many of the problems involve open research problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also security! If you don't “bloat” your company by hiring security people, you'll end up like hotmail or yahoo, where your product is better known for how often it's hacked than for any of its other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we've looked at so far is a technical problem. Compared to organizational problems, technical problems are straightforward. Distributed systems are considered hard because real systems might drop something like 0.1% of messages, corrupt an even smaller percentage of messages, and see latencies in the microsecond to millisecond range. When I talk to higher-ups and compare what they think they're saying to what my coworkers think they're saying, I find that the rate of lost messages is well over 50%, every message gets corrupted, and latency can be months or years. When people imagine how long it should take to build something, they're often imagining a team that works perfectly and spends 100% of its time coding. But that's impossible to scale up. The question isn't whether or not there will inefficiencies, but how much inefficiency. A company that could eliminate organizational inefficiency would be a larger innovation than any tech startup, ever. But when doing the math on how many employees a company “should” have, people usually assume that the company is an efficient organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post happens to use search as an example because I ran across some people who claimed that Lucene was going to surpass Google's capabilities any day now, but there's nothing about this post that's unique to search. If you talk to people in almost any field, you'll hear stories about how people wildly underestimate the complexity of the problems in the field. The point here isn't that it would be impossible for a small team to build something better than Google search. It's entirely plausible that someone will have an innovation as great as PageRank, and that a small team could turn that into a viable company. But once that company is past the VC-funded hyper growth phase and wants to maximize its profits, it will end up with a multi-thousand person platforms org, just like Google's, unless the company wants to leave hundreds of millions or billions of dollars a year on the table due to hardware and software inefficiency. And the company will want to handle languages like Thai, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, each of which is non-trivial. And the company will want to have relatively good security. And there are the hundreds of little features that users don't even realize that are there, each of which provides a noticeable increase in revenue. It's &quot;obvious&quot; that companies should outsource their billing, except that when you talk to companies that handle their own billing, they can point to individual features that increase conversion by single or double digit percentages that they can't get from Stripe or Braintree. That fifty person billing team is totally worth it, beyond a certain size. And then there's sales, which most engineers don't even think of; the exact same line of reasoning that applies to optimization also applies to sales -- as long as marginal benefit of adding another salesperson exceeds the cost, you should expect the company to keep adding salespeople, which can often result in a sales force that's larger than the engineering team. There's also research which, almost by definition, involves a lot of bets that don't pan out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that all of those things are necessary to run a service at all; it's that almost every large service is leaving money on the table if they don't seriously address those things. This reminds me of a common fallacy we see in unreliable systems, where people build the happy path with the idea that the happy path is the “real” work, and that error handling can be tacked on later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/postmortem-lessons/&quot;&gt;For reliable systems, error handling is more work than the happy path&lt;/a&gt;. The same thing is true for large services -- all of this stuff that people don't think of as “real” work is more work than the core service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;correction&quot;&gt;Correction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often make minor tweaks and add new information without comment, but the original version of this post had an error and removing the error was a large enough change that I believe it's worth pointing out the change. I had a back of the envelope calculation on the cost of indexing the web with Lucene, but the numbers were based on benchmarks results from some papers and comments from people who work on a commercial search engine. When I tried to reproduce the results from the papers, I found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu/status/814167684954738688?lang=ro&quot;&gt;it was trivial to get orders of magnitude better performance than reported in one paper&lt;/a&gt; and when I tried to track down the underlying source for the comments by people who work on a commercial search engine, I found that there was no experimental evidence underlying the comments, so I removed the example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I'm experimenting with writing blog posts stream-of-consciousness, without much editing. Both this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/&quot;&gt;and my last post&lt;/a&gt; were written that way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu&quot;&gt;Let me know what you think&lt;/a&gt; of these posts relative to my “normal” posts!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Leah Hanson, Joel Wilder, Kay Rhodes, and Ivar Refsdal for corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suitcase is a command line tool that can be &lt;em&gt;&quot;programmed&quot;&lt;/em&gt; to display a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/a&gt; interface that can trigger commands and scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, but for macOS and driven by the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Class Mac Citizen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its SwiftUI underpinnings Suitcase supports things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208976&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dark Mode&lt;/a&gt; out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Powerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its power and flexibility come form the tried and trusted UNIX command line. Anything you can do in Terminal you can do in Suitcase, but with a UI and export the command as a &lt;code&gt;.command&lt;/code&gt; file, to check in with a project or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase-Bazaar&quot;&gt;share with the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Command-Line Utility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;OVERVIEW: A flexible command line tool for instantly deploying user interfaces
for simple commands and scripts.

USAGE: Suitcase &amp;lt;subcommand&amp;gt;

OPTIONS:
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.

SUBCOMMANDS:
  basic                   Launch a basic Suitcase process, that has a main menu
                                                  and an icon in the Dock when running.
  utility                 Launch a utility Suitcase process, without a Dock
                                                  icon or main menu.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Suitcase &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt; Suitcase process has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/menus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;main menu&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;icon in the Dock&lt;/a&gt; when running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/blob/master/Basic.md&quot;&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Suitcase utility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;utility&lt;/code&gt; Suitcase process does not have a Dock icon or main menu. It consists of just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;main window&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/blob/master/Utility.md&quot;&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Export as a &lt;code&gt;.command&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Suitcase command can be exported as a self running &lt;code&gt;.command&lt;/code&gt; file. You can double click this file to launch the Suitcase or share the file (it's just plain text).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/blob/master/Resources/export-screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/raw/master/Resources/export-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Export Command&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples are very basic but should give you a good idea of how you can use Suitcase. If you have any questions please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/issues&quot;&gt;create an issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you create an example you'd like to share &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase-Bazaar&quot;&gt;open a PR at the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hello World&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example consisting of one button that when clicked calls the &lt;code&gt;say&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ Suitcase --name=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Demo App&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --window-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --window-width=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;200&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --window-height=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;200&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --control-type=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --control-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Give a face to every voice…&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --control-type=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --control-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;🗣 Say hello&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --control-action=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/bin/say Hello World&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/413136057&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/raw/master/Resources/hello-world.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the .gif to see a skippable video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Menus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example shows how to create menus and sub-menus. Actions can be attached to any menu item the same way as &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menu items can also be assigned a keyboard shortcut. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/blob/master/Basic.md&quot;&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ Suitcase --name=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Demo App&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --window-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Menus&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --control-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;UUID&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
        --control-type=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --control-identifier=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;com.label.uuid&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --menu-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Action&amp;gt;Generate&amp;gt;UUID&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
        --menu-action=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/bin/uuidgen&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
        --menu-action-destination=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;com.label.uuid&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --menu-title=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Action&amp;gt;Copy UUID&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --menu-shortcut=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;k&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \
  --menu-action=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/usr/bin/printenv com.label.uuid | /usr/bin/pbcopy&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/413141354&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/raw/master/Resources/menus.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Menus&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the .gif to see a skippable video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hidden Files &amp;amp; Folders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a more involved example that uses &lt;code&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; to read the macOS user defaults system and use &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; to set a state &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the command would be run in Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ defaults &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sed &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;s/1/Visible/g;s/0/Hidden/g&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The button uses &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to run two commands, one to write to the user defaults and the second to relaunch the Finder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kill the Finder and relaunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ killall Finder

<title>Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith</title>
<link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While almost every engineering team has considered moving to microservices at some point, the advantages they bring come with serious trade-offs. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconlondon.com/&quot;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconlondon.com/london2020/presentation/microservices-and-back-again-insights-both-sides-digital-tr&quot;&gt;Alexandra Noonan&lt;/a&gt; told how &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/&quot;&gt;Segment&lt;/a&gt; broke up their monolith into microservices, then, a few years later, went back to a monolithic architecture. In Noonan's words, &quot;If microservices are implemented incorrectly or used as a band-aid without addressing some of the root flaws in your system, you'll be unable to do new product development because you're drowning in the complexity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices were first introduced to address the limited fault isolation of Segment's monolith. However, as the company became more successful, and integrated with more external services, the operational overhead of supporting microservices became too much to bear. The decision to move back to a monolith came with a new architecture that considered the pain points around scaling related to company growth. While making sacrifices in modularity, environmental isolation, and visibility, the monolith addressed the major issue of operational overhead, and allowed the engineering team to get back to new feature development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noonan explained several key points in the evolution of Segment's architecture. The problems faced, and the decisions made at the time, sounded familiar to any experienced software engineer. Only with the advantage of hindsight is it clear which decisions could have been better. Noonan explained each major decision point on a timeline, and noted the pros and cons of each state of the system architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Segment started with a monolithic architecture. This provided low operational overhead, but lacked environmental isolation. Segment's functionality is based around integrating data from many different providers. In the monolith, problems connecting to one provider destination could have an adverse effect on all destinations and the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of isolation within the monolith was addressed by moving to microservices, with one worker service per destination. Microservices also improved modularity and visibility throughout the system, allowing the team to easily see queue lengths and identify problem workers. Noonan pointed out that visibility can be built in to a monolith, but they got it for free with microservices. However, microservices came with increased operational overhead and problems around code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A period of hypergrowth at Segment, around 2016-2017, added over 50 new destinations, about three per month. Having a code repository for each service was manageable for a handful of destination workers, but became a problem as the scale increased. Shared libraries were created to provide behavior that was similar for all workers. However, this created a new bottleneck, where changes to the shared code could require a week of developer effort, mostly due to testing constraints. Creating versions of the shared libraries made code changes quicker to implement, but reversed the benefit the shared code was intended to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noonan pointed out the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach to their microservices. Because there was so much effort required just to add new services, the implementations were not customized. One auto-scaling rule was applied to all services, despite each having vastly different load and CPU resource needs. Also, a proper solution for true fault isolation would have been one microservice per queue per customer, but that would have required over 10,000 microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision in 2017 to move back to a monolith considered all the trade-offs, including being comfortable with losing the benefits of microservices. The resulting architecture, named &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/&quot;&gt;Centrifuge&lt;/a&gt;, is able to handle billions of messages per day sent to dozens of public APIs. There is now a single code repository, and all destination workers use the same version of the shared library. The larger worker is better able to handle spikes in load. Adding new destinations no longer adds operational overhead, and deployments only take minutes. Most important for the business, they were able to start building new products again. The team felt all these benefits were worth the reduced modularity, environmental isolation, and visibility that came for free with microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QCon attendees discussing the presentation sounded like typical engineers joining a project with a long history. Quick remarks such as, &quot;Well, obviously you shouldn't do what they did,&quot; were countered with voices of experience pointing out that most decisions are made based on the best information available at the time. One of the key takeaways was that spending a few days or weeks to do more analysis could avoid a situation that takes years to correct.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>To Microservices and Back Again - Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith</og:title>
<og:description>When Segment moved to a microservices architecture, they gained environmental isolation, but at a cost of higher operational overhead. Three years later, the costs were too high, and the team migrated back to a monolith. At QCon London, Alexandra Noonan told the cautionary tale, and emphasized the importance of evaluating trade-offs in architectural decisions.</og:description>

<title>Anger Management</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://genevievefiles.blogspot.com/2020/04/anger-management.html</guid>
<description>I was molested and raped as a child. I spent my teens and twenties filled with anger. My therapist once said something like &quot;How did I know you were angry? Maybe it was the flames shooting out your ears.&quot;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't actually talking about me. He was describing someone else. But he could have been talking about me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took up role playing gaming in my teens and my first character was a Red Sonja-esque character with long red tresses. She was a fighter mage and she had issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaming was good for me. I made a lot of friends and they were mostly male and they were protective of me. I began to put down my baggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, I retired that first character because she was so angry and toxic and I wasn't anymore. Playing her required me to put back on the mantel of so much baggage that I had worked hard to put down and it wasn't good for me to keep that alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my late twenties, me and my husband bought a house and it was about thirty minutes from the military base where my career military husband worked. At least twice a month, I would go do a major grocery shopping trip on base, usually without the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We never had a lot of money and I didn't like spending money on myself because my kids and family came first. One of my few indulgences was that I put together a collection of audiotapes to listen to for the thirty minute drive each way for these twice monthly shopping trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I listened to was Def Leppard's &lt;em&gt;Hysteria&lt;/em&gt; album. A group of men singing about love and relationships did me a lot of good. One of my favorite songs was &lt;em&gt;Love Bites&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4XiSFyYRE8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Their work was meaningful to me in part because of the personal stories of the band members. Their drummer had anger management issues and, in a fit of rage, one night he wrecked his car really badly.&lt;p&gt;I saw an interview with him many years ago. My recollection, which may not be accurate anymore, is that he walked to a nearby farm house carrying his severed arm and said to the person who answered the door something about how he was a drummer and he had just lost his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He actually came close to losing both arms. It was fairly touch and go at first and my recollection or impression is that it had the flavor of someone wrestling with personal demons and he could have lost his second arm had he lost the battle to his inner demons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He decided to let his anger go and his remaining arm survived. And then he began a long, hard recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His band mates stood by him and they never considered replacing him. One of them said in an interview &quot;The music was still in there. It just needed to be redirected elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got him a custom drum set and he had to relearn how to make music with one less arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a big thing is that it is just as much physical labor but with fewer muscles to carry the load. Plus recovering from a limb amputation is a major health event, so stamina was a big issue for a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hired a backup drummer for their first tour to take some of the pressure off of him. At some point, the backup drummer was like thirty minutes late to a show for some reason and no one had noticed. At that point, they decided they didn't need him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of young men singing about love who also stood by their talented but now severely handicapped band member after he lost an arm is something that spoke to my soul. To me, these people had to know something more than pretty words. There had to be something deeper in their songs than just &quot;sex, drugs and rock and roll.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would listen to these songs by myself while driving and sometimes I cried. The voice of the lead singer was the sound of my soul healing, yet I never can remember his name. I think it's Joe something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't fantasize about having sex with the man. Sure, he was a sexy guy, but to me this was a spiritual connection. His voice and his music were washing my soul clean of things that the world often seems to think no one can wash off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a man who can say &quot;The music was still in there. We just needed to remap it.&quot; -- and my recollection is that it was the lead singer who said that -- and stand by his band mate, his brethern, this is not just a musician. This was the high priest of the sound temple of my car trips and I wouldn't sully it by treating him like a sex object in the privacy of my mind, though he's no doubt sexy as all hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm also a fan of Aerosmith. Their song &lt;em&gt;Janie's Got A Gun&lt;/em&gt; used to regularly bring me to tears any time I heard it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqQn2ADZE1A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It's a song about a girl who is a victim of incest who kills the perpetrator. I saw an interview and they talked about the fact that initially the lyrics said something about &quot;He raped a little baby girl&quot; and the music company wasn't willing to publish that. So they changed it from &lt;em&gt;raped&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;jacked&lt;/em&gt; and that went through.&lt;p&gt;A group of men singing about how child molestation is a bad thing, so bad that in the fantasy world of their song lyrics they are willing to celebrate the murder of such a man, this was also good for my soul. I needed to know that not all men thought that women were just sex objects whose feelings and personal sanctity didn't matter to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all men would turn a blind eye to how some men treat women and little girls. Some men very strongly disapprove of such things to the point that they implicitly believe such people deserve to die for their crimes, or so their song lyrics would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I was alone in my car and it came on the radio, I would listen to it, even if it meant delaying my errand because I had already parked. I would listen to it and cry and let go of just a little more of my baggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of sayings about anger and I used to collect such sayings. Here's one I held near and dear in my twenties when I was trying hard to figure out how to put down my anger instead of continuing to cling to it:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.&lt;br/&gt;-- Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But it didn't really work for me to try to be some sort of pacifist who never felt anger. I had to learn to relate to my anger in a healthy fashion and not just treat it like it was a bad thing in and of itself.&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy.&lt;br/&gt;-- Aristotle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I developed a mental model that there are basically two responses to a crisis: Depression or anger.&lt;p&gt;Depression is a coping mechanism of hunkering down and enduring a crisis. It is about not rocking the boat and that's sometimes appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger is energy for doing something about the problem. Righteous anger can be a force for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I learned to stop just stewing and being mad and wallowing in that feeling. I learned to do something about things that made me mad and this was the best thing I ever learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I'm really, really mad and just can't let it go, I need to take action. It doesn't mean I need to yell at people or be loud and emotional necessarily. But anger tells me there is injustice and working on a solution is the best way to stop being mad as hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think hurt people tend to cling to their anger because they hope to use it as a shield. They hope to not be made a fool of again. They think being mad as hell will serve as protection from bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a case of &quot;Once burned, twice shy&quot; so to speak. But it's often not a very effective approach to protecting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have been raped sometimes decide to hate all men as their solution, their idea of how to protect themselves. If they are, themselves, heterosexual, it can end up depriving them of any means to get their own sexual and emotional needs met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been burned and you are angry, recognize that you need to learn how to protect yourself effectively. Sometimes the best cure for anger is to find a better shield that will more effectively protect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23015430&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HN Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
