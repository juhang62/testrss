<title>Show HN: ClojureScript pixel game engine with Blender live-reloading</title>
<link>https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/clojurescript-pixel-game-engine-with-blender-live-reloading</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/clojurescript-pixel-game-engine-with-blender-live-reloading</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Aug. 17, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;61.195704057279&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been hacking on a game engine for &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinitelives.github.io/&quot;&gt;infinitelives&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/infinitelives/px3d&quot;&gt;px3d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;around.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://mccormick.cx/gfx/blogref/joplin/8e5a78db8e21423f9b6632be9cc47285.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clojurescript.org/&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/blender.org&quot;&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;Three.js&lt;/a&gt; and it runs in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature I'm particularly happy with is the live-reloading of Blender assets into the game. You hit &quot;save&quot; in Blender and the updates appear in the running game a second later - no need to re-compile or re-load the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;live-reloading.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://mccormick.cx/gfx/blogref/joplin/03a0feb654c6432d81bd01eedb9786ff.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this works is with a background script which watches the &lt;code&gt;assets.blend&lt;/code&gt; file. It re-builds the &lt;code&gt;assets.glb&lt;/code&gt; whenever it is modified, and writes the hash of the file into &lt;code&gt;assets.cljs&lt;/code&gt;. Figwheel pushes changes to the compiled cljs files whenever they change, and there is another bit of code which tells three.js to re-load &lt;code&gt;assets.glb&lt;/code&gt; if the hash has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infinitelives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://infinitelives.github.io/&quot;&gt;Infinitelives&lt;/a&gt; is the vehicle me and my buddy Crispin use to make games and tooling, mostly for gamejams. The gamejam format is great because it is time-boxed, which means we can periodically do this self-indulgent thing we enjoy without taking too much family or work time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamejams are typically only 48 hours long and so we have learned some good techniques for shipping working code under extreme constraints. A hardcore economy of time, resources, and scope is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clojurescript.org/&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://figwheel.org&quot;&gt;Figwheel&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for this with their hot-loading of modified code. I built the tight Blender re-load integration for the same reason. Hand drawn graphics consume a lot of time during jams and this should help us really level up on the content side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cda02a53bdeea5ee13ac8d943761a42b.png&quot; src=&quot;https://mccormick.cx/gfx/blogref/joplin/9c9b3668d5b94fbc8e4ca5d5f11146fd.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hacking the Sonos IKEA Symfonisk into a High Quality Speaker Amp</title>
<link>https://makezine.com/2019/08/16/hacking-the-sonos-ikea-symfonisk-into-a-high-quality-speaker-amp/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://makezine.com/2019/08/16/hacking-the-sonos-ikea-symfonisk-into-a-high-quality-speaker-amp/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as I saw IKEA’s announcement for a $99 Sonos-powered Airplay speaker, I was excited for the possibilities its internals could bring. And oh boy, was I right to be. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to whittle away the woefully inefficient compact speaker unit, and bring it to life on a pair of quality vintage bookshelf speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note about speaker selection. Be sure to select a pair of speakers that are (A) set up for bi-amping (eg. four input terminals instead of the standard two), or (B) a set of two-way speakers that you aren’t opposed to dissecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 Phillips Screwdriver (Possibly #1 as well, if you’re picky)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needle Nose Pliers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spudger or pick (if you don’t have fingernails long enough)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://makezine.com/?attachment_id=546424&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif?ssl=1&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=1875%2C2500&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-546424&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1875&quot; height=&quot;2500&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?w=1875&amp;amp;ssl=1 1875w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=620%2C827&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=90%2C120&amp;amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=300%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=301%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 301w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-546424&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=1875%2C2500&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1875&quot; height=&quot;2500&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?w=1875&amp;amp;ssl=1 1875w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=620%2C827&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=90%2C120&amp;amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=300%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001.jpg?resize=301%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 301w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t much information out there on disassembly of the speaker, a little bit of hunting around the sealed plastic enclosure revealed that the fabric tab with the Sonos and IKEA logos on it functioned as a pull tab to get the grille off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reveals the three acoustic elements, a 1 inch rubber done tweeter, a 3 inch woofer, and a curved tuned port. The rubber inserts that suspend the grille in place are firmly seated in their holes, requiring the needle-nose pliers to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath each insert is a Loctite sealed #2 phillips screw, which will each give out a small pop when unscrewed, due to the threadlocker releasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is the tricky part. The front panel, with all the speakers, is sealed to the case by a friction fit foam strip. The easiest way to remove it is to wedge as many fingers as you can into the bass port, and hook them around the bend (towards the tweeter) and pull firmly and consistently. Be careful not to yank the whole assembly too hard, as there are a few connections to the motherboard inside that can be quite fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it’s free from the foam seal, it’s easiest to open it up like a book, in order to get to the four spade connectors, two per driver, and the small flex cable for the buttons and status lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two different size spade connectors per speaker, a smaller one for ground, and a large one for the positive terminal. Be careful removing these, they are locking spade connectors, meaning that if you pull directly on them, something important will give instead of the connector. Pull back the clear heat shrink, and locate the small locking tab. Squeeze this down with the needle-nose pliers as you pull, and they come off with little to no effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is the tiny, fragile 8-pin flex cable, and corresponding connector, which the motherboard uses to connect to the front panel controls and indicator light. After peeling back the small oval-shaped foam tape covering the connector, use a spudger, or a fingernail, to open the latch, and gently lift out the end of the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the front panel is completely free, we get our first real look at the internals of the speaker, and WOW, is it impressive for the price. We’ll take a closer look at the motherboard later, but just as a precursor, we can see three large, name brand capacitors, a socketed wifi card (meaning a feasible wifi upgrade years on), and properly isolated high and low voltage sections of the PCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re next going to remove the brace that holds the foam-wrapped speaker cables in place. One short #2 phillips screws on each side of the plastic part come off, and with minimal effort, you can remove the cables and ferrite core from the clips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker cables have their own socket and connector, but watch out, as it is yet another locking connector. Use the end of your screwdriver to push the small rectangular latch towards the body of the connector, while simultaneously giving the cable a gentle tug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite corner of the motherboard, the AC power input has a similar connector, which is removed in the same way. Next to that are the two wifi antenna cables, one red and one yellow. It is easiest to remove these by removing the blob of hot glue they are seated in at the same time. If it all comes out in one unit, reassembly outside of the case will be easier. If not, peel away the excess hot glue, and prepare for the microscopic job of reconnecting the two coaxial connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, remove the six screws holding the motherboard in place. Be careful with the four screws closest to the bottom of the unit, as they are threaded into a cast aluminum heatsink, and require just a bit more torque. Remove the board from the enclosure, turning it diagonally to avoid the internal ribbing of the enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surprisingly large heatsink is held in by three more phillips screws, but be careful not to damage the two thermal pads when removing the screws. Remove the heatsink, and use four of the six motherboard screws to affix it back to its spot on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the motherboard and heatsink are one again, we can look closer at the board, and marvel at the quality of it. A good mixture of cheaper and more compact SMD components, as well as appropriately beefy through-hole components. Each side of the board has its own EMI shielded enclosure, with the computer on the front, and the amplifier on the back. Plated mounting holes, heavy doses of solastic, and name brand components all jump out as features of much more expensive circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the front panel, we can remove the four small phillips screws holding the button assembly to the panel. Remove these, and the buttons, rubber membrane, and small daughterboard are freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, slowly peel the flex cable from the bottom of the enclosure, as it’s needed to connect the two circuit boards. It’s worth noting that the 8 contact pads of the flex cable face towards the circuit board upon reinsertion. Remove the two phillips screws around the AC socket, and reconnect it to the motherboard for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up are the two oddly angled antennas in the top of the enclosure. Engineering-wise, these feel like an afterthought, as they each have their own plastic bracket connecting them to the enclosure, instead of having their mounts molded into the plastic, like all the other components. Speculation aside, they’re easy enough to remove, using a bit of force on the bottom of each bracket breaks the strong double-sided tape holding them in, and the hot glue holding the antenna cables into the enclosure is easy enough to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have all the electronics free, it’s time to connect them to the speaker and give it a quick test. This is what you should have in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with a speaker, of course. This is where things start to differ. As mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, you will need either a bi-amp-able speaker (i.e., separate terminals for woofer and tweeter) or a two-way speaker for which you can bypass the internal crossover. These are two discrete digital amplifiers, one for the tweeter, and one for the woofer. Bridging them not only causes the amplifier to shut down, but it may damage your $99 pile of circuit boards and wires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-546440&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=620%2C827&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=90%2C120&amp;amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=300%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image033.jpg?resize=301%2C400&amp;amp;ssl=1 301w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connections are as follows, for the tweeter, red for positive, black for negative, just like the textbook says. For the woofer, blue for positive, and white for negative. A polarity swap isn’t the end of the world, it’ll just cause your two-way speaker to be out of phase with itself. I have my board connected to a vintage JMLabs bi-amped two-way bookshelf speaker, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug in the AC cord, launch the Sonos app, and launch the real star of the show, the TruePlay tuning feature baked into the app, and your board. Follow the directions, disregarding that your speaker isn’t in its final resting place, as you can simply retune it later. The TruePlay software quickly adapts the digital crossover within the board, allocating the correct frequency ranges to the woofer and the tweeter of your speaker, making it sound near perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! One half of the perfect budget Sonos system. Repeat the procedure for your second speaker, maybe build yourself a nice enclosure for the electronics, and relish in the glory of a beautiful pair of Airplay-2, Sonos-enabled, TruePlay-tuned speakers for a few hundred bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The most frequent 777 characters give 90% coverage of Kanji in the wild</title>
<link>http://japanesecomplete.com/777</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://japanesecomplete.com/777</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on a report from 2000 that analyzed a large corpus of Japanese text, it says that at roughly the 750-800 character line, 90% of kanji occurrences in the wild are covered. By looking at the cumulative frequency of characters, the efficacy of learning the most frequent kanji first is shown by the following: 　７７７ characters: ９０.０％ coverage １４７７ characters: ９８.０％ coverage ２４７７ characters: ９９.９％ coverage [Caption: Let's use some rudimentary data science to hyper-accelerate your kanji acquisition!] So that the world may swiftly learn Japanese, without further adu, we give you the triple 7 kanji list (so far I've gotten through number 669, I'll update this once I'm done with the list).

<description>&lt;p&gt;Most videogame stories are power fantasies. You spend your time getting ever stronger, ever tougher, ever more formidable as you accumulate experience points, gold, and equipment. Obstacles aren’t things to go around; they’re things you go through. If you can’t get past any given monster, the solution is to go kill some other monsters, then come back when you’re yet more powerful and slay the big beast at last. Life, these games tell us, is or ought to be one unadulterated ride up the escalator of success; a setback just means you haven’t yet risen high enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dynamic held true in 1992 just as much as it usually does today. But during that year there came a well-nigh revolutionary game out of France that upended all of these traditional notions about what the medium of videogames can do and be. It cast you as a painfully ordinary, near-powerless individual adrift in a scary world, with no surefire panaceas in the form of experience points, gold, or portable rocket launchers to look forward to. It was just you and your wits, trapped in a haunted house full of creatures that were stronger than you and badly wanted to kill you. Despite its supernatural elements, this game’s scenario felt more disconcertingly close to real life than that of any of those other games. Here, you truly were alone in the dark. Aren’t we all from time to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4040&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4040&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover-236x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover-768x978.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover-500x637.jpg 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/440-alone-in-the-dark-dos-front-cover.jpg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any story of how this shockingly innovative game came to be must begin with that of Frédérick Raynal, its mastermind. Born in the south-central French town of Brive-la-Gaillarde in 1966, Raynal was part of the first generation of European youths to have access to personal computers. In fact, right from the time his father first came home with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/05/micro-men&quot;&gt;Sinclair ZX81&lt;/a&gt;, he was obsessed with them. He was also lucky: in a dream scenario for any budding hacker, his almost equally obsessed father soon added computers to the product line of the little videocassette-rental shop he owned, thus giving his son access to a wide variety of hardware. Raynal worked at the store during the day, renting out movies and watching them to kill the time — he was a particular fan of horror movies, a fact which would soon have a direct impact on his career — and helping customers with their computer problems. Then, with a nerdy young man’s total obliviousness to proportion, he hacked away most of the night on one or another of the machines he brought home with him. He programmed his very first released game, a platformer called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/exelvision/robix&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in 1986 on an obscure home-grown French computer called the Exelvision which his father sold at the store. His father agreed to sell his son’s Exelvision game there as well, managing to shift about 80 units to customers desperate for software for the short-lived machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raynal’s lifestyle was becoming so unbalanced that his family was beginning to worry about him. One day, he ran out of his room in a panic, telling them that all of the color had bled out of his vision. His mother bustled him off to an ophthalmologist, who told him he appeared to have disrupted the photoreceptors in his eyes by staring so long at a monitor screen. Thankfully, the condition persisted only a few hours. But then there came a day when he suddenly couldn’t understand anything that was said to him; he had apparently become so attuned to the language of computer code that he could no longer communicate with humans. That worrisome condition lasted several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus just about everyone around him took it as a good thing on the whole when he was called up for military service in 1988. Just before leaving, Raynal released his second game, this time for MS-DOS machines. Not knowing what else to do with it, he simply posted it online for free. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/popcorn&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popcorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2011/09/jobs-and-woz&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; clone with many added bells and whistles, the latest entry in a sub-genre which was enjoying new popularity following the recent success of the Taito arcade game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/arkanoid&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arkanoid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and its many ports to home computers and consoles. Raynal’s game could hold its head high in a crowded field, especially given its non-existent price tag. One magazine pronounced it one of the five best arcade games available for MS-DOS, whether commercial or free, and awarded it 21 points on a scale of 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raynal was soon receiving letters at his military posting from all over the world. “&lt;em&gt;Popcorn&lt;/em&gt; has made my life hell!” complained one player good-naturedly. Another wrote that “I caught acute &lt;em&gt;Popcornitus&lt;/em&gt;. And, it being contagious, now my wife has it as well.” When Raynal completed his service in the summer of 1989, his reputation as the creator of &lt;em&gt;Popcorn&lt;/em&gt; preceded him. Most of the companies in the French games industry were eager to offer him a job. His days working at his father’s computer store, it seemed, were behind him. The Lyon-based Infogrames, the most prominent French publisher of all, won the Raynal sweepstakes largely by virtue of its proximity to his hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Raynal quickly realized that the company he had elected to join was in a rather perilous state. An ambitious expansion into many European markets hadn’t paid off; in fact, it had very nearly bankrupted them. Bruno Bonnell, Infogrames’s co-founder and current chief executive, had almost sold the company to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/12/a-time-of-endings-part-2-epyx&quot;&gt;American publisher Epyx&lt;/a&gt;, but that deal had fallen through as soon as the latter had gotten their first good look at the state of his books. It seemed that Infogrames would have to dig themselves out of the hole they’d made. Thus Bonnell had slashed costs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/11/controlling-the-spice-part-2-cryos-dune&quot;&gt;shed subsidiaries&lt;/a&gt; ruthlessly just to stay alive. Now, having staunched the worst of the bleeding, he knew that he needed as many talented programmers as he could get in order to rebuild his company — especially programmers like Raynal, who weren’t terribly assertive and were naive enough to work cheap. So, Raynal was hired as a programmer of ports, an unglamorous job but an absolutely essential one in a European market that had not yet consolidated around a single computer platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnell, for his part, was the polar opposite of the shy computer obsessive he had just hired; he had a huge personality which put its stamp on every aspect of life at Infogrames. He believed his creativity to be the equal of anyone who worked for him, and wasn’t shy about tossing his staff ideas for games. He called one of them, which he first proposed when Raynal had been on the job for about a year, &lt;em&gt;In the Dark&lt;/em&gt;. A typically high-concept French idea, its title was meant to be taken literally. The player would wander through a pitch-dark environment, striking the occasional match from her limited supply, but otherwise relying entirely on sound cues for navigation. Bonnell and Raynal were far from bosom buddies, then or ever, but this idea struck a chord with the young programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Raynal saw it, the question that would make or break the idea was that of how to represent a contiguous environment with enough verisimilitude to give the player an embodied sense of really &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; there in the dark. Clearly, a conventional adventure-game presentation, with its pixel graphics and static views, wouldn’t do. Only one approach could get the job done: 3D polygonal graphics. Not coincidentally, 3D was much on Raynal’s mind when he took up Bonnell’s idea; he’d been spending his days of late porting an abstract 3D puzzle game known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/continuum&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continuum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Atari ST to MS-DOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had occasion to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this burgeoning new approach to game-making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/another-world&quot;&gt;in previous articles&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t rehash that material here. Suffice to say that the interest so many European programmers had in 3D reflected not least a disparity in the computing resources available to them in comparison to their American counterparts. American companies in this period were employing larger and larger teams, who were filling handfuls of floppy disks — and soon CD-ROMs — with beautiful hand-drawn art and even digitized snippets of real-world video. European companies had nothing like the resources to compete with the Americans on those terms. But procedurally-generated 3D graphics offered a viable alternative. At this stage in the evolution of computer technology, they couldn’t possibly be as impressively photorealistic as hand-drawn pixel art or full-motion video, but they could offer far more flexible, interactive, immersive environments, with — especially when paired with a French eye for aesthetics — a certain more abstracted allure of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, was the road Raynal now started down. It was a tall order for a single programmer. Not only was he trying to create a functional 3D engine from scratch, but the realities of the European market demanded that he make it run on an 80286-class machine, hardware the Americans by now saw as outdated. Even Bonnell seemed to have no confidence in Raynal’s ability to bring his brainstorm to fruition. He allowed Raynal to work on it only on nights and weekends, demanding that he spend his days porting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/06/simcity-part-1-will-wrights-city-in-a-box&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;SimCity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/the-68000-wars-part-5-the-age-of-multimedia&quot;&gt;Commodore CDTV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artist named Didier Chanfray was the closest thing to a partner and confidante which Raynal had at Infogrames during his first year of working on the engine. It was Chanfray who provided the rudimentary graphics used to test it. And it was also Chanfray who, in September of 1991, saw the full engine in action for the first time. A character roamed freely around a room under the control of Raynal, able to turn about and bend his body and limbs at least semi-realistically. The scene could be viewed from several angles, and it could be lit — or not — by whatever light sources Raynal elected to place in the room. Even shadows appeared; that of the character rippled eerily over the furniture in the room as he moved from place to place. Chanfray had never seen anything like it. He fairly danced around Raynal’s desk, pronouncing it a miracle, magic, alchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Bruno Bonnell had negotiated and signed a new licensing deal — not exactly a blockbuster, but something commensurate with a rebuilding Infogrames’s circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4041&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/concept/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4041&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4041&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4041&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/concept-300x205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/concept-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/concept.jpg 463w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4041&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Something tentacled and other-worldly, it seems, got into the water at Infogrames from the start: Didier Chanfray provided this very Lovecraftian concept drawing for Raynal’s game long before the conscious decision was made to turn it a Lovecraft pastiche. Raynal kept the sketch tacked on the wall beside his desk throughout the project as a reminder of the atmosphere he was going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American horror writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2015/09/the-campy-cosmic-horror-of-h-p-lovecraft&quot;&gt;H.P. Lovecraft&lt;/a&gt;, who died well before the advent of the computer age in 1937, was nowhere near as well-known in 1991 as he is today, but his so-called “Cthulhu Mythos” of extra-dimensional alien beings, terrifying by virtue of their sheer indifference to humanity and its petty morality, had already made appearances in games. The very first work of ludic Lovecraftia would appear to be the 1979 computer game &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluerenga.blog/tag/kadath/?order=asc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kadath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an odd sort of parser-less text adventure. Two years later, at the height of the American tabletop-RPG craze, a small company called Chaosium published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2015/09/lovecraft-on-the-tabletop&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a game which subverted the power fantasy of tabletop &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; in much the same way that Raynal’s project would soon be subverting that of so many computer games. Still, although &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; was well-supported by Chaosium and remained reasonably popular by the standards of its niche industry throughout the 1980s and beyond, its success didn’t lead to any Lovecraftian onslaught in the realm of digital games. The most notable early example of the breed is Infocom’s very effective 1987 interactive fiction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2015/10/the-lurking-horror&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lurking Horror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But, being all text at a time when text adventures were becoming hard sells, it didn’t make much commercial impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, Bonnell believed the time had come for a more up-to-date Lovecraftian computer game; he believed such a thing could do well, both in France and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovecraft had long had a strong following in France. From the moment his books were first translated into the language in 1954, they had sold in considerable numbers. Indeed, in 1991 H.P. Lovecraft was about as popular in France as he was anywhere — arguably more popular on a per-capita basis than in his native land. The game of &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; too had long since been translated into French, giving a potential digital implementation of it as much natural appeal there as in its homeland. So, Bonnell approached Chaosium about licensing their &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; rules for computers, and the American company agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When viewed retrospectively, it seems a confusing deal to have made, one that really wasn’t necessary for what Infogrames would ultimately choose to do with Lovecraft. When Lovecraft died in obscurity and poverty, he left his literary estate in such a shambles that no one has ever definitively sorted out its confusing tangle of copyright claimants; his writing has been for all intents and purposes in the public domain ever since his death, despite numerous parties making claims to the contrary. Prior to publishing their Lovecraft tabletop RPG, Chaosium had nevertheless negotiated a deal with Arkham House, the publisher that has long been the most strident of Lovecraft’s copyright claimants. With that deal secured, Chaosium had promptly trademarked certain catchphrases, including “Call of Cthulhu” itself, in the context of games. Yet as it turned out Infogrames would use none of them; nor would they draw any plots directly from any of Lovecraft’s published stories. Like the countless makers of Lovecraftian games and stories that would follow them, they would instead draw from the author’s spirit and style of horror, whilst including just a few of his more indelible props, such as the forbidden book of occult lore known as the &lt;em&gt;Necronomicon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Lovecraftian game Infogrames would make would, of course, be the very game that Frédérick Raynal had now spent the last year or so prototyping during his free time. By the time news of his work reached Bonnell, most of Infogrames’s staff were already talking about it like the second coming. While the idea that had inspired it had been wonderfully innovative, it seemed absurd even to the original source of said idea to devote the best 3D engine anyone had ever seen to a game that literally wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; you see what it could do most of the time. It made perfect sense, on the other hand, to apply its creepy visual aesthetic to the Lovecraft license. The sense of dread and near-powerlessness that was so consciously designed into the tabletop RPG seemed a natural space for the computer game as well to occupy. It was true that it would have to be &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; in concept only: the kinetic, embodied, real-time engine Raynal had created wasn’t suitable for the turn-based rules of the tabletop RPG. For that matter, Raynal didn’t even like the Chaosium game all that much; he considered it too complicated to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Bonnell, who couldn’t fail to recognize the potential of Raynal’s project, put whatever resources he could spare from his still-rebuilding company at the mild-mannered programmer’s disposal: four more artists to join Chanfray, a sound designer, a second programmer and project manager. When the team’s first attempts at writing an authentic-feeling Lovecraftian scenario proved hopelessly inadequate, Bonnell hired for the task Hubert Chardot, a screenwriter from 20th Century Fox’s French division, a fellow who loved Lovecraft so much that he had turned his first trip to the United States into a tour of his dead hero’s New England haunts. One of Chardot’s first suggestions was to add the word “alone” to the title of the game. He pointed out, correctly, that it would convey the sense of existential loneliness that was such an integral part of Lovecraftian horror — even, one might say, the very thing that sets it apart from more conventional takes on horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4044&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;You can choose to enter the mansion as either of two characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game takes place in the 1920s, the era of Lovecraft himself and of most of his stories (and thus the default era as well for Chaosium’s &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; game). It begins as you arrive in the deserted Louisiana mansion known as Derceto, whose owner Jeremy Hartwood has recently hanged himself. You play either as Edward Carnby, a relic hunter on the trail of a valuable piano owned by the deceased, or as Emily Hartwood, the deceased’s niece, eager to clear up the strange rumors that have dogged her uncle’s reputation and to figure out what really went down on his final night of life. The direction in which the investigation leads you will surprise no one familiar with Lovecraft’s oeuvre or Chaosium’s RPG: occult practices, forbidden books, “things man was never meant to know,” etc. But, even as Chardot’s script treads over this ground that was well-worn already in the early 1990s, it does so with considerable flair, slowly revealing its horrifying backstory via the books and journals you find hidden about the mansion as you explore. (There is no in-game dialog and no real foreground story whatsoever, only monsters and traps to defeat or avoid.) Like most ludic adaptations of Lovecraft, the game differs markedly from its source material only in that there is a victory state; the protagonist isn’t absolutely guaranteed to die or become a gibbering lunatic at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4043&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/aotd1/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4043&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4043&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4043&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD1-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD1-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD1.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4043&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;One of the in-game journals, which nails the spirit and style of Lovecraft perfectly. As I noted in an earlier article about the writer, the emotion he does better than any other is disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Chaosium wasn’t at all pleased when Infogrames sent them an early build of the game for their stamp of approval. It seems that the American company had believed they were licensing not just their trademarks to their French colleagues, nor even the idea of a Lovecraft game in the abstract, but rather the actual &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; rules, which they had expected to see faithfully implemented. And, indeed, this may have been Bonnell’s intention when he was making the deal — until Raynal’s 3D engine had changed everything. Chaosium, who had evidently been looking forward to an equivalent of sorts to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop&quot;&gt;Gold Box&lt;/a&gt; line of licensed &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; CRPGs, felt betrayed. After some tense negotiation, they agreed to let &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; continue without the &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; name on the box; some editions would include a note saying the game had been “inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft,” while others wouldn’t even go that far. In return for Chaosium’s largess on this front, Infogrames agreed to make a more conventional adventure game that would make explicit use of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/call-of-cthulhu-shadow-of-the-comet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fruit of that negotiation, would prove a serviceable game, albeit one that still didn’t make much direct use of the tabletop rules. But, whatever its merits, it would come and go without leaving much of a mark on an industry filled to bursting with graphical adventures much like it in terms of implementation. &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, would soon be taking the world by storm — and Chaosium could have had their name on it, a form of advertisement which could hardly have failed to increase their commercial profile dramatically. Chalk it up as just one more poor decision in the life of a company that had a strange talent for surviving — Chaosium is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chaosium.com&quot;&gt;still around to this day&lt;/a&gt; — without ever quite managing to become really successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infogrames got their first preview of just what an impact &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; was poised to make in the spring of 1992, when Dany Boolauck, a journalist from the French videogame magazine &lt;em&gt;Tilt&lt;/em&gt;, arrived to write a rather typical industry puff piece, a set of capsule previews of some of the company’s current works-in-progress. He never got any further than &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;. After just a few minutes with it, he declared it “the best game of the last five years!” and asked for permission to turn the capsule blurb about it into a feature-length article, complete with a fawning interview with Raynal. (He described him in thoroughly overwrought terms: as a reincarnation of The Little Prince from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s beloved novella of the same name.) In a “review” published in the summer of 1992, still a couple of months before Infogrames anticipated releasing the game, he gave it 19 of 20 stars, gushing over its “exceptional staging” and “almost perfect character movement,” calling it “a revolution in the field of play” that “people must buy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Bonnell was pleased with the positive press coverage, but less thrilled by Boolauck’s portrayal of Raynal as the game’s genius auteur. He called in his introverted young programmer, who seemed a bit befuddled by all the attention, and told him to scrub the words “a Frédérick Raynal creation” from the end credits. &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, he said, was an &lt;em&gt;Infogrames&lt;/em&gt; creation, full stop. Raynal agreed, but a grievance began to fester in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Bonnell’s policy of not advertising the individuals behind Infogrames’s games, Raynal’s name didn’t spread quite so far and wide as that of such other celebrated gaming auteurs as Éric Chahi, the mastermind of &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;, France’s standout game from the previous year. Nevertheless, upon its European release in September of 1992, Raynal’s game stood out on its own terms as something special — as an artistic creation that was not just fun or scary but &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; to its medium. As one would expect, the buzz started in France. “We review many games,” wrote one magazine there. “Some are terrible, some mediocre, some excellent. And occasionally there comes along &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; game that will revolutionize the world of microcomputers, one that causes sleepless nights, one that you cannot tear yourself away from, can only marvel at. We bid welcome now to the latest member of this exclusive club: &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;.” By the end of 1992, the game was a hit not only in France but across most of Europe. Now for America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnell closed a deal with the American publisher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2015/05/brian-fargo-and-interplay&quot;&gt;Interplay&lt;/a&gt; for distribution of the game there. Interplay had also published &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;, which had turned into a big success Stateside, and the company’s head Brian Fargo was sure he saw similar potential in &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;. He thus put the game through his company’s internal testing wringer, just as he had &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;; the French studios had their strengths, but such detail work didn’t tend to be among them. Raynal’s game became a much cleaner, much more polished experience thanks to Interplay’s QA team. Yet Bonnell still had big international ambitions for Infogrames, and he wasn’t willing to let such a remarkable game as this one share with &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt; the fate of becoming known to American players simply as an Interplay title. Instead he convinced Fargo to accept a unique arrangement. Interplay and Infogrames each took a stake in a new shared American subsidiary known as I-Motion, under which imprint they published &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game took North America by storm in early 1993, just as it had Europe a few months earlier. It was that rarest of things in games, a genuine paradigm shift; no one had ever seen one that played quite like this. Worldwide, it sold at least 400,000 copies, putting Infogrames on the map in the United States and other non-European countries in the process. Indeed, amidst the international avalanche of praise and punditry, perhaps the most gratifying press notice of all reached Frédérick Raynal’s ears from all the way off in Japan. Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; and many other iconic Nintendo classics, proclaimed &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; to be, more so than any other game, the one he wished he could have come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4045&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/aotd3/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4045&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4045&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4045&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD3-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD3-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD3.jpg 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4045&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Arguably the creepiest visual in the game is the weird mannequin’s head of your own character. Its crudely painted expression rather smacks of Chucky the doll from the &lt;em&gt;Child’s Play&lt;/em&gt; horror films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen from the perspective of a modern player, however, the verdict on &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; must be more mixed. Some historically important games transcend that status to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/about-me/hall-of-fame&quot;&gt;remain vital experiences&lt;/a&gt; even today, still every bit as fun and playable as the day they were made. But others — and please forgive me the hoary old reviewer’s cliché! — haven’t aged as well. This game, alas, belongs to the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in an era when 3D graphics have long since ceased to impress us simply for existing at all, those of &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; are pretty painful to look at, all jagged pixels sticking out everywhere from grotesquely octagonal creatures. Textures simply don’t exist, leaving everything to be rendered out of broad swatches of single colors. And the engine isn’t even holistically 3D: the 3D characters move across pasted-on pre-rendered backgrounds, which looks decidedly awkward in many situations. (On the other hand, it could have been worse: Raynal first tried to build the backgrounds out of digitized photographs of a real spooky mansion, a truly unholy union that he finally had to give up on.) Needless to say, a comparison with the lovingly hand-drawn pixel art in the adventure games being put out by companies like LucasArts and Sierra during this period does the crude graphics found here no favors whatsoever. Some of the visuals verge on the unintentionally comical; one of the first monsters you meet was evidently meant to be a fierce dragon-like creature, but actually looks more like a sort of carnivorous chicken. (Shades of the dragon ducks from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/08/living-worlds-of-action-and-adventure-part-1-the-atari-adventure&quot;&gt;original Atari &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4046&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/aotd4/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4046&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4046&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4046&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD4-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD4-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD4-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD4.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4046&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Dead again! Killed by… Prince during his &lt;em&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/em&gt; period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, too, the keyboard-only controls are clunky and unintuitive, and they aren’t made any less awkward by a fixed camera that’s constantly shifting about to new arbitrary locations as you move through the environment; some individual rooms have as many as nine separate camera angles. This is confusing as all get-out when you’re just trying to get a sense of the space, and quickly becomes infuriating when you’re being chased by a monster and really, really don’t have time to stop and adjust your thinking to a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more abstract design choices also leave something to be desired. Sudden deaths abound. The very first room of the game kills you when you step on a certain floorboard, and every book is either a source of backstory and clues or an instant game-ender; the only way to know which it is is to save your game and open it. Some of the puzzles are clever, some less so, but even those that are otherwise worthy too often depend on you standing in &lt;em&gt;just the right&lt;/em&gt; position; if you aren’t, you get no feedback whatsoever on what you’re doing wrong, and are thus likely to go off on some other track entirely, never realizing how close you were to the solution. This fiddliness and lack of attention to the &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; in the “if, then, else” dynamic of puzzle design is a clear sign of a game that never got sufficiently tested for playability and solubility. At times, the game’s uncommunicativeness verges on the passive-aggressive. You’ll quickly grow to loathe the weirdly stilted message, “There is a mechanism which can be triggered here,” which the game is constantly spitting out at you as you gaze upon the latest pixelated whatsit. Is it a button? A knob? A keyhole? Who knows… in the end, the only viable course of action is to try every object in your inventory on it, then go back and start trying all the other objects you had to leave lying around the house thanks to your character’s rather brutal inventory limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4047&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/08/alone-in-the-dark/aotd5/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4047&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4047&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4047&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD5-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD5-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD5-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOTD5.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4047&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Fighting is a strange, bloodless pantomime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, one might be able to write some of the game’s issues off as an aesthetic choice — as merely more ways to make the environment feel unsettling. Franck de Girolami, the second programmer on the development team as well as its project leader, has acknowledged using the disorienting camera consciously for just that purpose: “We realized that the camera angles in which the player was the most helpless were the best to bring in a monster. Players would instantly run for a view in which they felt comfortable.” While one does have to admire the team’s absolute commitment to the core concept of the game, the line between aesthetic choice and poor implementation is, at best, blurred in cases like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the fact remains that it was almost entirely thanks to that same commitment to its core concept that &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; became one of the most important games of its era. Not a patch on a contemporary like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/02/life-off-the-grid-part-2-playing-ultima-underworld&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultima Underworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a demonstration of the full power and flexibility of 3D graphics — to be fair, it ran on an 80286 processor with just 640 K of memory while its texture-mapped, fully 3D rival demanded at least an 80386 with 2 MB — it remained conceptually unlike anything that had come before in daring to cast you as an ordinary mortal, weak and scared and alone, for whom any aspirations toward glory quickly turn into nothing more than a desperate desire to just &lt;em&gt;escape&lt;/em&gt; the mansion. For all that it threw the &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt; rules completely overboard, it retained this most fundamental aspect of its inspiration, bringing Chaosium’s greatest innovation to a digital medium for the first time. It’s not always impossible to kill the monsters in &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; — often it’s even necessary to do so — but, with weapons and ammunition scarce and your health bar all too short, doing so never fails to feel like the literal death struggle it ought to. When you do win a fight, you feel more relieved than triumphant. And you’re always left with that nagging doubt in the back of the mind as you count your depleted ammo and drag your battered self toward the next room: was it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legacy of this brave and important game is as rich as that of any that was released in its year, running along at least three separate tracks. We’ll begin with the subsequent career of Frédérick Raynal, its original mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeds of that career were actually planted a couple of weeks before the release of &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, when Raynal and others from Infogrames brought a late build of it to the European Computer Trade Show in London. There he met the journalist Dany Boolauck once again, learning in the process that Boolauck had switched gigs: he had left his magazine and now worked for Delphine Software, one of Infogrames’s French competitors. Delphine had recently lost the services of their biggest star: Éric Chahi, the auteur behind the international hit &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;. As his first assignment in his own new job, Boolauck had been given the task of replacing Chahi with a similarly towering talent. Raynal struck him as the perfect choice; he rather resembled Chahi in many respects, what with his very French aesthetic sensibility, his undeniable technical gifts, and his obsessive commitment to his work. Boolauck called in Paul de Senneville, the well-known composer who had launched Delphine Software as a spinoff from his record label of the same name, to add his dulcet voice to the mix. “We wish to place you in a setting where you will be able to create, where you will not be bullied, where we can make you a star,” said the distinguished older gentleman. “We want to give free rein to the fabulous talent you showed in &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;.” When Raynal returned to Lyon to a reprimand from Bruno Bonnell for letting his game’s planned release date slip by a week, the contrast between his old boss and the possible new one who was courting him was painted all too clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to Raynal’s dismay, Bonnell was already pushing him and the rest of the team that had made the first &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; to make a sequel as quickly as possible using the exact same engine. One Friday just before the new year, Bonnell threw his charges a party to celebrate what he now believed would go down in history as the year when his struggling company turned the corner, thanks not least to Raynal’s game. On the following Monday morning, Raynal knocked on Bonnell’s office door along with three other members of the newly christened &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark 2&lt;/em&gt; team, including his most longstanding partner Didier Chanfray. They were all quitting, going to work for Delphine, Raynal said quietly. Much to their surprise, Bonnell offered to match Delphine’s offer, the first overt sign he’d ever given that he understood how talented and valuable they really were. But his counteroffer only prompted Delphine to raise the stakes again. Just after New Years Day, Bonnell bowed out of the bidding in a huff: “You want to leave? Goodbye!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later, the videogame magazine &lt;em&gt;Génération 4&lt;/em&gt; held an awards ceremony for the previous year’s top titles at Disneyland Paris. Everyone who had been involved with &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, both those who still worked at Infogrames and those who didn’t, was invited. When, as expected, it took the prize for top adventure game, Bruno Bonnell walked onto the stage to accept the award on behalf of his company. The departure of Raynal and crew being the talk of the industry, the room held its collective breath to see what would happen next. “My name is Bruno Bonnell,” he said from behind the rostrum. “I’d like to thank God, my dog, my grandmother, and of course the whole team at Infogrames for a beautiful project.” And with that he stumped offstage again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hadn’t been a particularly gracious acceptance speech, but Raynal and his colleagues nonetheless had much to feel good about. Dany Boolauck and Paul de Senneville were true to their word: they set Raynal up with a little auteur’s studio all his own, known as Adeline Software. They even allowed him to run it from Lyon rather than joining the rest of Delphine in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, all of the &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; technology, along with the name itself and the Chaosium license (whatever that was worth), stayed with Infogrames. Raynal and his colleagues were thus forced to develop a new engine in the style of the old and to devise a fresh game idea for it to execute. Instead of going dark again, they went light. Released in 1994, &lt;em&gt;Little Big Adventure&lt;/em&gt; (known as &lt;em&gt;Relentless: Twinsen’s Adventure&lt;/em&gt; in North America) was a poetic action-adventure set in a world of cartoon Impressionism, consciously conceived by Raynal as an antidote to the ultra-violent &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; mania that was sweeping the culture of gaming at the time. He followed it up in 1997 with &lt;em&gt;Little Big Adventure 2&lt;/em&gt; (known as &lt;em&gt;Twinsen’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; in North America). Although both games were and remain lovely to look at, Raynal still struggled to find the right balance between the art and the science of game design; both games are as absurdly punishing to play as they are charming to watch, with a paucity of save points between the countless places where they demand pin-point maneuvering and split-second timing. This sort of thing was, alas, something of a theme with the French games industry for far too many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, is one legacy of &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;. Another followed on even more directly, taking the form of the two sequels which Infogrames published in 1993 and 1994. Both used the same engine, as Bruno Bonnell had demanded in the name of efficiency, and both continued the story of the first game, with Edward Carnby still in the role of protagonist. (Poor Emily Hartwood got tossed by the wayside.) But, although Hubert Chardot once again provided their scripts, much of the spirit of the first game got lost, as the development team began letting the player get away with much more head-to-head combat. Neither sequel garnered as many positive reviews or sales as the original game, and Infogrames left the property alone for quite some time thereafter. A few post-millennial attempts to revive the old magic, still without the involvement of Raynal, have likewise yielded mixed results at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s with &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;‘s third legacy, its most important by far, that we should close. For several years, few games — not even its own sequels — did much to build upon the nerve-wracking style of play it had pioneered. But then, in 1996, the Japanese company Capcom published a zombie nightmare known as &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; for the Sony Playstation console. “When I first played &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;,” remembers Infogrames programmer Franck de Girolami, “I honestly thought it was plagiarism. I could recognize entire rooms from &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;.” Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; sold in huge numbers on the consoles, reaching a mass market the likes of which &lt;em&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, being available only on computers and the 3DO multimedia appliance, could never have dreamed. In doing so, it well and truly cemented the new genre that became known as survival-horror, which had gradually filtered its way up from the obscure works of a poverty-stricken writer to a niche tabletop RPG to a very successful computer game to a mainstream ludic blockbuster. Culture does move in mysterious ways sometimes, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Plans to Deprecate FTP URL Support in Chrome</title>
<link>https://www.pulltech.net/article/1566007822-Google-plans-to-deprecate-FTP-URL-support-in-Chrome</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pulltech.net/article/1566007822-Google-plans-to-deprecate-FTP-URL-support-in-Chrome</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently people can access FTP list and download resources hosted on FTP servers in Chrome through FTP URLs, but this may not work anymore in the near future. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/feature/6246151319715840&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; published by Chrome engineers, there is a plan to deprecate FTP support in Chrome version 82.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/Chrome.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major motivation for this deprecation is that Chrome doesn't have an encrypted FTP connection support(FTPs), this raises security risk of downloading resources over FTP. Since users can access FTP URLs and download resources, there is no encryption of the data which indicates any sensitive information would be exposed to middle man attack. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2013/12/security-risks-of-ftp-and-benefits-of.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;other vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/ftp-list.PNG&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another motivation for this deprecation is that the usage of FTP in Chrome is low which isn't worth of investing more resource to improve the current FTP implementation in Chrome and there are other bugs in the implementation which further demotivates the FTP support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alternative secure FTP implementations and clients in all platforms such as FileZilla, so users should not be impacted by this deprecation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deprecation will start from Chrome version 82 planned to be released in 2020 Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making email more modern with JMAP</title>
<link>https://fastmail.blog/2019/08/16/jmap-new-email-open-standard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fastmail.blog/2019/08/16/jmap-new-email-open-standard/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The specifications for JMAP Email have been published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), marking a big victory for email tools now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fastmail engineers have been working for the past five years to bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/&quot;&gt;JMAP technology&lt;/a&gt; to developers and customers. We’re proud to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8620&quot;&gt;RFC 8620&lt;/a&gt;, published on July 18th, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8621&quot;&gt;RFC 8621&lt;/a&gt;, published on August 13th, have introduced JMAP to the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These documents have been reviewed and refined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted publisher of high quality, fully open technical specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;webelieveopenstandardsdrivethepoweroftheinternet&quot;&gt;We believe open standards drive the power of the internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open standards make it possible for you to keep connected across your services. Without them, companies build proprietary protocols that can lock you into a single provider. We believe you deserve more choices for email providers, and control so you can change providers as you please. We want a more level playing field so more email innovation can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open standards allow you to select tools from different providers, and have them work together. In our work to make email fast, efficient, and fair, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2018/03/29/challenge-of-calendaring/&quot;&gt;contribute to improving open standards for all the services that we use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creatingstandardsthatmaketheinternetwork&quot;&gt;Creating standards that make the internet work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear to our team that we could offer more to email customers if we had a protocol aligned with how people use email today. As champions of open standards, we wanted that technology to be available to customers using any email client. The existing open email protocol, IMAP, was designed before mobile devices were common and makes long-lived, inefficient connections. You can learn more about our reasoning for replacing IMAP at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmap.io/&quot;&gt;JMAP website&lt;/a&gt; under “Why is this needed?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/&quot;&gt;announced our work on JMAP&lt;/a&gt;, a new protocol that leveraged existing standards to make it easier for developers to work with email on the web and in modern programming environments. JMAP also lets us, as well as other email developers, create more features for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary author of the specification is &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/author/neilj/&quot;&gt;Neil Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, Director and User Experience Architect at Fastmail, and the co-author is Chris Newman, Principal Engineer at Oracle. Our CEO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/author/brong/&quot;&gt;Bron Gondwana&lt;/a&gt;, worked to shepherd the specification through the IETF as co-chair of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/blog/jmap/&quot;&gt;JMAP working group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With JMAP we want to spur email innovation by making the best protocol for email be an open standard,” says Jenkins. “This work is based on years of real-world experimentation at Fastmail and conversations with developers at other major email providers and client teams. The result is a protocol that’s much easier for developers to work with, makes efficient use of network resources, and allows a richer experience for mobile users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;avictoryfiveyearsinthemaking&quot;&gt;A victory five years in the making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 18th, 2019, after months of knowing we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2018/12/27/jmap-is-on-the-home-straight/&quot;&gt;on the home straight&lt;/a&gt;, we could finally bring out the champagne glasses. RFC 8620 was published, introducing a model for efficient data synchronization. On August 13th, 2019, RFC 8621 took what IMAP does for email and made it simpler, faster, and more extendable using the JMAP framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IETF, experts from all over the world generate new specifications. Whether from big tech companies, universities, or other interested parties, we work together as equals to create high-quality internet standards. For Fastmail engineers, we see IETF’s acceptance and support of JMAP as a tremendous achievement, demonstrating what big ideas and hard work can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatthismeansforyou&quot;&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fastmail and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.topicbox.com/&quot;&gt;Topicbox&lt;/a&gt; customers are already benefiting from JMAP. It backs our web interface and apps, giving customers a reliable and streamlined experience, with more enhancements coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hope that something speaks to you in learning about the international cooperation, community, and inclusion that open standards foster. Through knowing our customers, it’s clear to us that many email users today are uncomfortable with the control that some providers are asking you to give up. What you need and expect is private, secure email, which you can always access, and that you fully own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, proprietary tools make these core concepts fragile. Open standards keep improving based on new technologies and consumer needs, giving people back the power and control that they expect when using email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, JMAP makes massive email archives ready for you remotely nearly as fast if you had the data already on your device. On mobile, instead of waiting for a refresh, you get instant push notifications when the server receives an email. Plus, JMAP makes it easy to add a subset of information from a mailbox or calendar to a new service. Developers can build on top of existing services, creating more tools and conveniences for customers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;howtousejmaprightnow&quot;&gt;How to use JMAP right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been thinking about developing for email, you can start working with JMAP today! Developers can learn more about implementation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmap.io/#i-want-to-implement-it-what-do-i-need-to-know&quot;&gt;jmap.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development releases of the open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyrusimap.org/&quot;&gt;Cyrus IMAP&lt;/a&gt; server have JMAP support already, built and maintained by Fastmail engineers. Set up a test mail server and monitor both ends of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fastmail apps and web interface are also using JMAP already, and we have an invitation-only developer beta underway. If you’re interested in using Fastmail for your JMAP development, please subscribe to our developer public beta group at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmap.topicbox.com/groups/fastmail-dev-beta&quot;&gt;Topicbox&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll contact you as we add more developers to our beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working hard to grow adoption of JMAP by other providers, too. In the future, it will be available to more people as email clients, and servers made by other companies and developers add support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the speed of the future, try Fastmail today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/signup/&quot;&gt;Start a free trial&lt;/a&gt; and don’t forget to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/mobileapp.html&quot;&gt;try our mobile apps&lt;/a&gt; during your trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy your experience as part of the next wave of email innovation!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;ve reproduced 130 research papers about “predicting the stock market”</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/cr7jey/ive_reproduced_130_research_papers_about/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/cr7jey/ive_reproduced_130_research_papers_about/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;ok, so firstly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;all of the papers I found through Google search and Google scholar. Google scholar doesn't actually have every research paper so you need to use both together to find them all. They were all found by using phrases like &quot;predict stock market&quot; or &quot;predict forex&quot; or &quot;predict bitcoin&quot; and terms related to those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Next,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I only tested papers written in the past 8 years or so, I think anything older is just going to be heavily Alpha-mined so we can probably just ignore those ones altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Anything where it's slightly ambiguous with methodology, I tried every possible permutation to try and capture what the authors may have meant. For example, one paper adds engineered features to the price then says &quot;then we ran the data through our model&quot; - it's not clear if it means the original data or the engineered data, so I tried both ways. This happens more than you'd think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;THEN,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Anything that didn't work, I tried my own ideas with the data they were using or substituted one of their models with others that I knew of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Now before we go any further, I should caveat that I was a profitable trader at multiple Tier-1 US banks so I can say with confidence that I made a decent attempt of building whatever the author was trying to get at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Oh, and one more thing. All of this work took about 7 months in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Right, let's jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So with the papers, I found as many as I could, then I read through them and put them in categories and then tested each category at a time because a lot of papers were kinda saying the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Here are the categories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;News Text Mining.&lt;/em&gt; - This is where they'd use NLP on headlines or the body of news as a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Social data - Twitter Sentiment/Google Search/Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt;. Again, some were NLP, for google trends they just used the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Technical Analysis &amp;amp; Machine Learning together&lt;/em&gt;. Most of these would take the price, add TA features, then feed into a ML model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Other machine learning (as in, not using TA)&lt;/em&gt;. Just using the price and some other engineered features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Analyst Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;. Literally just taking the recommendations from banks/brokers and using that as the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Fundamental data&lt;/em&gt;. So ratios from the income statement/balance sheet,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Literally every single paper was either p-hacked, overfit, or a subsample of favourable data was selected (I guess ultimately they're all the same thing but still) OR a few may have had a smidge of Alpha but as soon as you add transaction costs it all disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Every author that's been publicly challenged about the results of their paper says it's stopped working due to &quot;Alpha decay&quot; because they made their methodology public. The easiest way to test whether it was truly Alpha decay or just overfitting by the authors is just to reproduce the paper then go further back in time instead of further forwards. For the papers that I could reproduce, all of them failed regardless of whether you go back or forwards. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Now, results from the two most popular categories were:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;*Social data.*A lot of research papers were extensions of or based off of a paper by Johan Bollen called &quot;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Twitter mood predicts the stock market&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. It literally has 3,955 citations and is complete and utter horse shit; the paper is p-hacking to the extreme. Not only could I not reproduce the results, but given the number of sentiment indicators he uses I regularly found correlations between sentiment and my data based on how I engineered it. None of these correlations held over longer time periods. Every paper that's a derivative of this one or cites it has the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;*Technical analysis &amp;amp; machine learning.*Every paper would do something along the lines of.. take past price data for some asset (stocks, forex), then add technical analysis indicators as &quot;features&quot;. Then either they'd run through a feature-selector that figures out the best features then put the best ones into a model OR they'd dump this data straight into the model and afterwards select the subset of instruments that it &quot;worked&quot; on. None of these would hold if you k-fold test them or test on different subsets of data outside of the ones used in the paper. The results are always based off of selecting favourable subsets of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;The most frustrating paper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I have true hate for the authors of this paper: &quot;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;A deep learning framework for financial time series using stacked autoencoders and long-short term memory&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Probably the most complex AND vague in terms of methodology and after weeks trying to reproduce their results (and failing) I figured out that they were leaking future data into their training set (this also happens more than you'd think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;The two positive take-aways that I did find from all of this research are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP&quot; readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Almost every instrument is mean-reverting on short timelines and trending on longer timelines. This has held true across most of the data that I tested. Putting this information into a strategy would be rather easy and straightforward (although you have no guarantee that it'll continue to work in future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;When we were in the depths of the great recession, almost every signal was bearish (seeking alpha contributors, news, google trends). If this holds in the next recession, just using this data alone would give you a strategy that vastly outperforms the index across long time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hopefully if anyone is getting into this space this will save you an absolute tonne of time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So in conclusion, if you're building trading strategies, &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;simple is good&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Also one other thing I'd like to add, even the Godfather of value investing, the late Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor) used to test his strategies (even though he'd be trading manually) so literally every investor needs to backtest regardless of if you're day-trading or long-term investing or building trading algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japan surpasses China as largest foreign holder of US Treasurys</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan surpassed China as the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has added about $21 billion since May, making its holdings the largest since October, 2016. Japan now holds $1.12 trillion Treasurys, and China has $1.11 trillion, a $2 billion increase from the month earlier, according to U.S. Treasury department data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been a less aggressive buyer of the U.S. sovereign debt, and market players have speculated that one action it could take in the trade war with the U.S. is to lighten up on its U.S. holdings. But there are no signs that is happening, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is the third-largest holder with $342.3 billion, up from $323.1 billion a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
