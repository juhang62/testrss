    &lt;/time&gt;

        
  &lt;/div&gt;

  



       &lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission proposed an overhaul of the agency’s online comment system after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-people-post-comments-on-federal-regulations-many-are-fake-1513099188?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;millions of fake comments were posted&lt;/a&gt; about a recent FCC rule change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCC’s 




      Ajit Pai




       said in a letter to two senators that he was proposing “to rebuild and re-engineer” the commission’s electronic comment system “to institute appropriate safeguards against abusive conduct.”&lt;/p&gt; 




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the July 6 letter to Sens. 




      Pat Toomey, 




       a Pennsylvania Republican, and 




      Jeff Merkley, 




       an Oregon Democrat, Mr. Pai said he has asked Congress for permission to shift funds to pay for the comment system overhaul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Messrs. Toomey and Merkley wrote to Mr. Pai in May to complain that their names had improperly been used to post comments on Mr. Pai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-readies-unwinding-of-net-neutrality-regime-1513247401?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;repeal of Obama-era rules on the internet known as net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The senators have opposing positions on the repeal, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/2-senators-disagree-on-net-neutrality-but-agree-the-fcc-needs-to-secure-its-online-comments-1527015911?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;they agree that the FCC’s comment system is broken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is troubling that some bad actors submitted comments using false names,” Mr. Pai said in the letter. “Indeed, like you, comments were submitted in my name and my wife’s name that reflect viewpoints we do not hold.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Pai’s move comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-people-post-comments-on-federal-regulations-many-are-fake-1513099188?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal uncovered thousands of fraudulent comments&lt;/a&gt; on regulatory dockets at five federal agencies, including the FCC—some using what appear to be stolen identities posted by computers programmed to pile comments onto the dockets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-found-the-fakes-1513101491?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Journal contacted thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; who said they didn’t draft or authorize comments that were posted in their names. Mr. Pai cited 7.5 million identical comments that came from 50,000 individuals whose addresses didn’t appear to exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the changes proposed by the senators and accepted by Mr. Pai was to require commenters to fill out a Captcha—a system designed to prove humans rather than bots provided the information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview Tuesday, Sen. Merkley said that while he was pleased to hear of safeguards, he was disappointed that Mr. Pai didn’t seem to take seriously his request that the use of his name to file a public comment be referred to the Justice Department for investigation. Mr. Pai said in his letter that he couldn’t comment “on any such investigations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the misuse of commenters’ identities, Mr. Pai said in the letter that the victim could send the commission a statement that also would be put on the public record alongside the fake comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said Mr. Merkley: “The system of public comment is completely broken and manipulated to the point that it has basically lost any integrity or value.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 




      Alex Howard, 




       an open-government advocate and founder of e-PluribusUnum.org, which has urged safeguards in the comment system, said the FCC fixes are a small step. “Adding a Captcha to try to prevent spam, unfortunately, sounds like a solution from the last millennium to a decidedly 21st century set of problems,” Mr. Howard said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An FCC spokesman declined to comment beyond what was in the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;James V. Grimaldi at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james.grimaldi@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;james.grimaldi@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Donald Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'http://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;solar tariffs&lt;/a&gt; and desire to prop up the coal industry can’t stop renewable energy. A solar auction in Nevada just yielded the cheapest solar project in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It broke a record that was set [checks calendar] last week. Not only that, the price the plant will operate at is cheaper than new natural gas and coal plants. While the sunny weather in Nevada and federal tax credits certainly play a role, it’s also part of a clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/mexico-just-auctioned-off-the-cheapest-solar-project-in-1820676364#_ga=2.42651621.1327569358.1528845635-1762295482.1524154050&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/mexico-just-auctioned-off-the-cheapest-solar-project-in-1820676364#_ga=2.42651621.1327569358.1528845635-1762295482.1524154050', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;trend of solar power&lt;/a&gt; becoming cost-competitive with and even starting to beat fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The project in question is the Eagle Shadow Mountain Solar Farm, which will begin operating in 2021. The farm will have a generating capacity of 300 megawatts, enough to power about 210,000 American homes. But it’s the price part that’s eye-popping. It will operate at a flat rate of $23.76 per megawatt-hour over the course of a 25-year power purchasing agreement (the term for a contract between an electricity generator and utility who buys it). On the surface, that price may not mean a lot to you if you’re not an energy nerd, but it’s a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On their face, they’re less than a third the price of building a new coal or natural gas power plant,” Ramez Naam, an energy expert and lecturer at Singularity University, told Earther in an email. “In fact, building these plants is cheaper than just &lt;em&gt;operating&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; coal or natural gas plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a 30 percent federal investment tax credit for solar projects that helps drive down the cost of this and other solar projects. But Naam said even if you take away that credit, “these bids, &lt;em&gt;un-subsidized&lt;/em&gt;, are still cheaper than any new coal or gas plants, and possibly cheaper than operating existing plants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price and size of the plant handily beats the cheapest confirmed solar project in the country, a title that formerly belonged to a piddly 30 megawatt farm in Arizona that was part of an effort to replace the aging Navajo Generating Station (&lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/solar-is-killing-major-arizona-coal-plant-despite-tribe-1826670124#_ga=2.24516732.713082378.1528719151-619078092.1521480267&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/solar-is-killing-major-arizona-coal-plant-despite-tribe-1826670124#_ga=2.24516732.713082378.1528719151-619078092.1521480267', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;some tribal members aren’t happy&lt;/a&gt;). That project was auctioned for the low, low price of $24.99 per megawatt-hour over the duration of its 20-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nevada auction also included a number of projects that link up utility-scale solar with batteries. Mastering solar plus storage will be critical for renewables to truly overtake fossil fuels, since they only generate power when it’s sunny or when the wind blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Three years ago you almost never saw batteries as part of a new solar or wind project,” Naam said. “In 2018, we’ve seen battery storage frequently show up as part of these bids. Energy storage is becoming the new normal with solar bids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these projects have one important have one important factor in common: being located in the sunny Southwest. That geography absolutely plays a role in keeping prices low. But increasingly efficient technology also helps, and Naam said these prices are a bellwether of what’s to come in the next few years in places like Texas, California, and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also show that the efforts of the Trump administration to prop up fossil fuels at the expense of renewables aren’t enough to push solar out to sea. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/almost-everyone-is-outraged-by-trump-s-solar-tariff-1822330070', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;tariffs that Trump levied&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year against cheap solar panels imported from China &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/trumps-solar-tariff-could-kill-the-fastest-growing-job-1822337710&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/trumps-solar-tariff-could-kill-the-fastest-growing-job-1822337710', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;could eventually dampen installations&lt;/a&gt;. Naam said they add roughly 10 percent to the price of utility-scale projects, but “at most, they move the price of solar back by about a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they haven’t slowed solar deployments yet. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-adds-25-gw-pv-q1-2018-growing-13-year-over-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-adds-25-gw-pv-q1-2018-growing-13-year-over-year', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released by the Solar Energy Industries Association on Tuesday revealed that 55 percent of all U.S. electricity generating capacity installed in the first quarter of 2018 was solar. A whopping 2.5 gigawatts of solar was added, marking the 10th straight quarter where more than 2 gigawatts of capacity added. The report also noted that total installed capacity could double in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is good news, but the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewables needs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://earther.com/costa-rica-plans-to-be-the-worlds-first-fossil-fuel-fre-1825950235&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://earther.com/costa-rica-plans-to-be-the-worlds-first-fossil-fuel-fre-1825950235', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;happen even faster&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The San Franciso Fire Department makes its own wooden ladders by hand</title>
<link>https://gizmodo.com/inside-san-francisos-fire-department-where-ladders-are-1552279252</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gizmodo.com/inside-san-francisos-fire-department-where-ladders-are-1552279252</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--l5yCRiv3--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/pqqddsqymlp8nqmofees.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;970&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;pqqddsqymlp8nqmofees&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco's Fire Department is one of the few left in the United States that still uses wooden ladders. Each is made by hand at a dedicated workshop. Some have been in rotation for nearly a century. We'll get to the why and how, but hang on: Wouldn't a wooden ladder burn? Yes. They go up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds like a terrifying safety hazard, but these ultra-durable climbing tools aren't constructed from run-of-the-mill kindling. I visited the SFFD's in-house ladder studio and main repair facility in SF's industrial Bayview neighborhood, where every single fire apparatus cycles through when it needs to get fixed up. My guide, Mike Braun, has been on-site for the past 20 years, and has run the whole show for 16 of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proud motto of the SFFD workshop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Wood?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood is resilient in ways which aluminum—now standard for fire department ladders—can't even compare. &quot;You know if you take an empty coke can and bend it three or four times and it tears really easy? That's what aluminum ladders will do,&quot; Braun says. &quot;They have a seven to eight year lifespan, after which they need to be replaced.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wooden ladders, on the other hand, can last indefinitely. &quot;You can stress wood right up to its failure point a million times; as long as you don't go beyond that, it will come right back to where it was. They can be involved in a fire for a pretty long time; after that, it's just a matter of sanding off the top coat of material then inspecting the wood. If it's good we'll re-oil it, revarnish it, and put it back in service.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;A panorama of the ladder shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lest you think this is just a quick fix for your own failing apparatus, the shop is starting out with an exceptionally high grade of lumber. Ladder rails are all made from West Coast Douglas Fir, which Braun says is harvested from the eastern slope of a mountain: That side gets less sunshine; which means the trees grow more slowly; resulting in rings that are closer together and an all-around more resilient material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There have to be nine rings per inch—minimum,&quot; Braun tells me. &quot;You don't want them spread too far apart because that makes it weaker. Plus, the grain pattern can't vary more than 15 degrees off of vertical, with no knots, no inclusions, no funny marks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;970&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;791483808511033639&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is marked up to show which part of the wood will be used for rails based on the SFFD's exacting standards. Anything that doesn't make the cut will be turned into cross-beams or pulls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Waiting is the Hardest Part&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it passes the ring density test, then it's time to fully acclimate the wood to San Francisco's climate, which is about 13 percent moisture, before it's ready for action. Each piece is left in the workshop for years until it hits the right ratio—at one year per inch of thickness, it's quite a wait! Testing is done by pounding a probe into each end of the wood and sending a current between the two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;970&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;eokqtgy68flqzhehrmf4&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's where the wood sits for years, acclimating to the moisture level in SF's climate. The darker pieces on the top have been around for longer—&quot;Some are 50 years old,&quot; Braun says—while the boards on the bottom still have a ways to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Never a Wasted Rung&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now the wood is properly aged—what next? &quot;Our ladders were designed to be disassembled and reassembled,&quot; Braun says. &quot;We use machinist level measurements so all the rungs are spaced properly and precisely.&quot; Each ladder gets two coats of linseed oil, then two or three coats of marine spar varnish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That incredibly precise craftsmanship is obviously imperative to making damn certain these things will withstand the most extreme conditions and incredible wear and tear, but there's an important mix-and-match component to that design decision—one that's central to the way the workshop and repair facility approach their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're all pretty eco-friendly around here,&quot; Braun says. &quot;We don't like to waste.&quot; This could be their second motto. To wit: Elements from every ladder—all 13 different styles, the tallest of which is 50 feet—can be repurposed in a newer incarnation, should the original need to be taken out of service for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;970&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;fbsnlvza41xtlsnt449u&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you can see old rungs—made of Hickory or Ash—being used on new rails. &quot;Those were from a bigger ladder; we just turn the ends, and put 'em in the next size down.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each ladder gets two coats of linseed oil, then two or three coats of marine spar varnish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the ladders above. &quot;See what happens? You have a sharp edge right there on the left—that's a brand new ladder that's been refinished once or twice. That one on the right is probably 60 years old, and has been refinished five or six times. That one in the middle is ready to be taken out of service because it's getting too thin. We may load test it and keep it as a spare— one of those just-in-case ladders. But you can see as they get older the wood gets darker from the finish.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the whole center is like an ultra-high-efficiency hub for upcycling; almost everything is salvageable in some way. &quot;Anything that we can reuse to save money for the city, we'll reuse it. The idea is always to economize how we can by utilizing component parts—especially because we've already paid for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Wood's So Great, Why Don't More Fire Departments Use It?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a city-specific reason why San Francisco has stuck with wood rather than swap over to metals, and the answer lies in looking up. The high-voltage cables and wires that guide the city's (oft-maligned) public transport system Muni, and trolley cars crisscross above nearly every street, mean that ladders made of conductive elements are generally just too dangerous to use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think there's a lot of fire departments that went aluminum and wish they could go back to wood but it's too expensive,&quot; Braun says. &quot;There's only two ladders manufacturers in the states—and we're one of 'em. We only make our own ladders and can barely even keep up with what we have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 28 years, a man named Jerry Lee built and restored all of San Francisco's ladders—he retired last year, and finished his reign with a stint as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://workshopresidence.com/collections/jerry-lee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://workshopresidence.com/collections/jerry-lee', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;artist-in-residency&lt;/a&gt; at Workshop Residence. After all that time, showing his handiwork to a new audience offered an entirely new perspective. &quot;I was so surprised when people referred to the ladders as 'beautiful.' For me they've always just been functional,&quot; he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had one ladder here that was fully involved in a fire for 25 minutes, and the whole tip of it—six feet—was crispy. It looked like a log you pull out of a campfire,&quot; Braun says. &quot;That can't go back in service but we were curious, so we put a new halyard [rope used to hoist ladders] on it for a load test. Even in that condition, it passed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of the main repair facility. &quot;We fix literally everything. The only thing we don't do here is Muni—they have their own facility—and some of the water department stuff.&quot; Each of the portable lifts beneath the raised vehicles can hold seven-and-a-half tons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;And finally: This may have been my favorite part of the tour. &quot;Pete has collected all these different donuts over the years. They're all real, and covered with lacquer so they won't go bad. Some of these are ten years old.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>San Francisco&amp;#39;s Fire Department is one of the few left in the United States that still uses wooden ladders. Each is made by hand at a dedicated workshop. Some have been in rotation for nearly a century. We&amp;#39;ll get to the why and how, but hang on: Wouldn&amp;#39;t a wooden ladder burn? Yes. They go up in flames.</og:description>

&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown New Tab allows you to take down important notes, thoughts or anything else you need to jot down or paste quickly, directly into your New Tab page... via the markdown syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown will allow you to easily create headings, subheadings, links, styled texts, checkboxes, tables, lists, images and much more... just by a simple syntax. To get the hang of it, check this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&quot;&gt;brilliant cheat sheat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown New Tab is complete with the ability to store revisions of the markdown content you made, so if you ever need to look back at previous versions of your content, check the revision history!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clone this repo:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git clone https://github.com/plibither8/markdown-new-tab
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Chrome and go to &lt;code&gt;chrome://extensions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable 'Developer Mode' by checking the tickbox (on the top of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the 'Load Unpacked Extension' button and select the &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt; folder of the cloned repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extension should be loaded now and the 'New Tab' page should be Markdown New Tab. 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing in Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox the extension can be installed temporarily until you restart the browser. To do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;enter &quot;about:debugging&quot; in the URL bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click &quot;Load Temporary Add-on&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open the extension's directory in your local repo and select &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plibither8/markdown-new-tab/blob/master/markdown-new-tab/dist/manifest.json&quot;&gt;dist/manifest.json&lt;/a&gt; More info &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can edit and save the texts either by pressing the buttons on the top right, or by using the shortcuts &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; (or &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; on Mac) to edit the text and &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;S&lt;/kbd&gt; (or &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;S&lt;/kbd&gt; on Mac) to save the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code makes use of &lt;code&gt;localStorage()&lt;/code&gt; to save the raw text and the time and date of when the edit has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable user to change colors/add themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement user-defined markdown rendering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other gimmicks to make it less minimalistic (?)&lt;/li&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-employment-20180710-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a share of gross domestic income, corporate profits have nearly doubled, to 6.4% in 2016 from 3.3% in 1990, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Meanwhile, the labor share, measured as wages and salaries paid to individuals, has been on a schneid, falling to 42.2% in 2013 from 46.2% in 1991. The labor share has since crept up to 43% as of 2016, but it’s still well below its postwar peak of 51.5%, reached in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Djbsort: A new software library for sorting arrays of integers</title>
<link>https://sorting.cr.yp.to/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sorting.cr.yp.to/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;djbsort is a new software library for sorting arrays of integers. It provides the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are not separate options: there is a single sorting function that is simultaneously fast, secure, and verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://sorting.cr.yp.to/install.html&quot;&gt;current release&lt;/a&gt; of djbsort has the following limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides fast verified code only for CPUs with the AVX2 instruction set (e.g., Intel Haswell). However, the underlying techniques can easily be ported to other CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sorts only signed 32-bit integers. However, the underlying techniques can easily be adapted to integers of other sizes (e.g., 16 bits or 64 bits); floating-point numbers of various sizes (e.g., 32 bits or 64 bits); etc. The techniques can also, with slightly more effort, permute fixed-size records or pointers to variable-size records along with the keys being sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It requires the array to fit into RAM (plus swap space). However, the underlying techniques can easily be adapted to larger arrays, such as arrays stored on disk. The data-access pattern is quite regular, and standard techniques to further reduce disk accesses are applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sorts an array using one core on one machine, so the latency is suboptimal for large arrays. However, the underlying techniques can easily be parallelized across cores and across machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verification does not check memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verification runs separately for each array size, and becomes slower as the array size increases. On the other hand, this verification covers the specific array sizes used in cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The djbsort author is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr.yp.to/djb.html&quot;&gt;Daniel J. Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;djbsort builds upon results from the following paper: Daniel J. Bernstein, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Tanja Lange, Christine van Vredendaal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/papers.html&quot;&gt;&quot;NTRU Prime: reducing attack surface at low cost&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, Selected Areas in Cryptography 2017. The NTRU Prime paper explained how to make constant-time sorting software run faster than Intel's sorting software on Intel CPUs, and demonstrated this with a software release in 2017. djbsort includes verification and provides another 2x speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version:&lt;/strong&gt; This is version 2018.07.10 of the &quot;Intro&quot; web page.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

<title>Why Isn&amp;#039;t Debugging Treated as a First-Class Activity?</title>
<link>https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/07/why-isnt-debugging-treated-as-first.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/07/why-isnt-debugging-treated-as-first.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Côté has published a &quot;vision for engineering workflow at Mozilla&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrcote.info/blog/2018/07/05/a-vision-for-engineering-workflow-at-mozilla-part-two/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrcote.info/blog/2018/07/10/a-vision-for-engineering-workflow-at-mozilla-part-three/&quot;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds really good. These are its points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking out the full mozilla-central source is fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source code and history is easily navigable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing a development environment is fast and easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building is fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews are straightforward and streamlined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code is landed automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug handling is easy, fast, and friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metrics are comprehensive, discoverable, and understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information on “code flow” is clear and discoverable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider also Gitlab's &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/product/&quot;&gt;advertised features&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of your process, GitLab provides powerful planning tools to keep everyone synchronized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create, view, and manage code and project data through powerful branching tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep strict quality standards for production code with automatic testing and reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy quickly at massive scale with integrated Docker Container Registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab's integrated CI/CD allows you to ship code quickly, be it on one - or one thousand servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure your applications and infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically monitor metrics so you know how any change in code impacts your production environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security capabilities, integrated into your development lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing developers spend a lot of time on is completely absent from both of these lists: &lt;strong&gt;debugging!&lt;/strong&gt; Gitlab doesn't even list anything debugging-related in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/product/missing/&quot;&gt;missing features&lt;/a&gt;. Why isn't debugging treated as worthy of attention? I genuinely don't know — I'd like to hear your theories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my theories is that debugging is ignored because people working on these systems aren't aware of anything they could do to improve it. &quot;If there's no solution, there's no problem.&quot; With Pernosco we need to raise awareness that progress &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible and therefore debugging &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; demand investment. Not only is progress possible, but debugging solutions can deeply integrate into the increasingly cloud-based development workflows described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of my theories is that many developers have abandoned interactive debuggers because they're a very poor fit for many debugging problems (e.g. multiprocess, time-sensitive and remote workloads — especially cloud and mobile applications). Record-and-replay debugging solves most of those problems, but perhaps people who have stopped using a class of tools altogether stop looking for better tools in the class. Perhaps people equate &quot;debugging&quot; with &quot;using an interactive debugger&quot;, so when trapped in &quot;add logging, build, deploy, analyze logs&quot; cycles they look for ways to improve those steps, but not for tools to short-circuit the process. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; This &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17505920&quot;&gt;HN comment&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of the attitude that if you're not using a debugger, you're not debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox switching to clang-cl for Windows builds</title>

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Bug 1443590 is switching our official Windows builds to use clang-cl&lt;br /&gt;as the compiler.&lt;p&gt;Please keep an eye out for regressions and file a blocking bug for&lt;br /&gt;anything that might be fallout from this change. I'm especially&lt;br /&gt;interested in hearing about the quality of the debugging experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the patch may bounce and we'll go back and forth to&lt;br /&gt;MSVC for a while. You can check your build's compiler at&lt;br /&gt;`about:buildconfig`.

This is a *major* milestone. And while&lt;br /&gt;the transition will likely have a few bumps, the payoff should be well&lt;br /&gt;worth it.&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us get here. From the initial work to&lt;br /&gt;support Clang on Windows a few years ago. To the upstream work that was put&lt;br /&gt;into LLVM and Clang (especially by Google/Chromium).

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;27.249039385207&quot;&gt;At the moment, performance is a mixed bag. Some tests are up and some&lt;br /&gt;are down. In particular I believe Speedometer is down a few percent.&lt;p&gt;Note however that clang-cl is punching above its weight. These builds&lt;br /&gt;currently have neither LTO nor PGO, while our MSVC builds use both of&lt;br /&gt;those. Any regressions that we're seeing ought to be short-lived. Once&lt;br /&gt;we enable LTO and PGO, I expect clang to be a clear performance win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the short-term regressions end up being unacceptable, we can revert&lt;br /&gt;to MSVC later in the release, but at this early point in the cycle&lt;br /&gt;that shouldn't prevent us from collecting data on Nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.1739130434783&quot;&gt;

The MSVC nightly builds will likely continue until we fully commit to clang-cl. It is expensive to maintain MSVC workarounds and given that cross-language LTO[1] is compelling for Firefox, it is unlikely we'd return to MSVC.&lt;p&gt;Anthony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49879&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49879&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Actually, I don't think we do produce MSVC nightly builds. We *do* MSVC&lt;br /&gt;build on automation, but they're not exactly nightlies. You won't find&lt;br /&gt;them along other nightlies. And until bug 1474756 lands, those builds&lt;br /&gt;aren't even with PGO enabled.&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b6ccef5a13c58f59163d966f0dc68ceac29e3ee3/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f6269672d6c6f676f2d76322e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b6ccef5a13c58f59163d966f0dc68ceac29e3ee3/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f6269672d6c6f676f2d76322e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;cheat.sh logo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://cheat.sh/files/big-logo-v2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified access to the best community driven cheat sheets repositories of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine for a moment that there is such a thing as an ideal cheat sheet. What should it look like? What features should it have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concise&lt;/strong&gt; — It should be concise; it should only contain the things you need, and nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt; — It should be possible to use it instantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive&lt;/strong&gt; — It should contain answers for every question you could have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal&lt;/strong&gt; — It should be available everywhere, as soon as needed, without any preparations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unobtrusive&lt;/strong&gt; — It does not distract you from your main task when you are using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tutoring&lt;/strong&gt; — It helps you to learn the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconspicuous&lt;/strong&gt; — It should be possible to use it completely unnoticed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a thing does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cheat.sh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has a simple curl/browser interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers 55 programming languages, several DBMSes, and more than 1000 most important UNIX/Linux commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides access to the best community driven cheat sheets repositories in the world as well as to StackOverflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available everywhere, no installation needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultrafast, returns answers, as a rule, within 100 ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a convenient command line client, &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt;, that is very advantageous and helpful, though not mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used directly from code editors, without opening a browser and not switching your mental context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports a special mode (stealth mode), where it can be used fully invisibly, not even touching a key and not making a sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/85cf29460f6af99d0e1ddb467fde7ec32b6e9989/68747470733a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f64656d6f2d6375726c2e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/85cf29460f6af99d0e1ddb467fde7ec32b6e9989/68747470733a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f64656d6f2d6375726c2e676966&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://cheat.sh/files/demo-curl.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a cheat sheet for a UNIX/Linux command from a command line, query the service using &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; or any other HTTP/HTTPS client specifying the name of the command in the query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cheat.sh/tar
    curl cht.sh/curl
    curl https://cheat.sh/rsync
    curl https://cht.sh/tr
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, you can use both HTTPS and HTTP to access the service, and both the long (cheat.sh) and the short (cht.sh) service names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt; are names of the UNIX/Linux commands, you want to get cheat sheets for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know the name of the command you need, you can search for it using the &lt;code&gt;~KEYWORD&lt;/code&gt; notation. For example, to see how you can make &lt;code&gt;snapshots&lt;/code&gt; of a filesystem/volume/something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/~snapshot
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e4e9a05b478358161e8ddbf2666746768d582db/68747470733a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f6368742e73682d75726c2d7374727563747572652e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e4e9a05b478358161e8ddbf2666746768d582db/68747470733a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f6368742e73682d75726c2d7374727563747572652e6a7067&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://cheat.sh/files/cht.sh-url-structure.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming languages cheat sheets are located not directly in the root namespace, but in special namespaces, dedicated to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/go/Pointers
    curl cht.sh/scala/Functions
    curl cht.sh/python/lambda
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the list of available programming language cheat sheets, do a special query &lt;code&gt;:list&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/go/:list
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(almost) each programming language has a special page, named &lt;code&gt;:learn&lt;/code&gt;, that describes the language basics (that's a direct mapping from the &lt;em&gt;&quot;Learn X in Y&quot;&lt;/em&gt; project). It could be a good starting point, if you've just started learning a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no cheat sheet for some programming language query (and it is almost always the case), it is generated on the fly, basing on available cheat sheets and answers on StackOverflow. Of course, there is no guarantee that the returned cheat sheet will be a 100% hit, but it is almost always exactly what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try these (and your own) queries to get the impression of that, what the answers look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/go/reverse+a+list
    curl cht.sh/python/random+list+elements
    curl cht.sh/js/parse+json
    curl cht.sh/lua/merge+tables
    curl cht.sh/clojure/variadic+function
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't like an answer for some of your queries, you can pick another one: for that, repeat the query with an additional parameter &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; etc. appended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/python/random+string
    curl cht.sh/python/random+string/1
    curl cht.sh/python/random+string/2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheat sheets are formatted as code of the queried programming language (at least we are trying our best to do so) so they can be pasted into a program in this language directly. Text comments, if there are any, are formatted according to the language syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ curl cht.sh/lua/table+keys
    -- lua: retrieve list of keys in a table

    local keyset={}
    local n=0

    for k,v in pairs(tab) do
      n=n+1
      keyset[n]=k
    end

    --[[
       [ Note that you cannot guarantee any order in keyset. If you want the
       [ keys in sorted order, then sort keyset with table.sort(keyset).
       [ 
       [ [lhf] [so/q/12674345] [cc by-sa 3.0]
       ]]

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't need text comments in the answer, you can eliminate them using a special option &lt;code&gt;?Q&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ curl cht.sh/lua/table+keys?Q
    local keyset={}
    local n=0

    for k,v in pairs(tab) do
      n=n+1
      keyset[n]=k
    end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you don't need syntax highlighting, switch it off using &lt;code&gt;?T&lt;/code&gt;. You can combine the options together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl cht.sh/go/reverse+a+list?Q
    curl cht.sh/python/random+list+elements?Q
    curl cht.sh/js/parse+json?Q
    curl cht.sh/lua/merge+tables?QT
    curl cht.sh/clojure/variadic+function?QT
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full list of all options described below and in &lt;code&gt;/:help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try your own queries. Follow these rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to be more specific (&lt;code&gt;/python/append+file&lt;/code&gt; is better than &lt;code&gt;/python/file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/python/append&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask practical question if possible (yet theoretical question are possible too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask programming language questions only; specify the name of the programming language as the section name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate words with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; instead of spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use special characters, they are ignored anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the programming languages queries below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Command line client, cht.sh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheat.sh service has its own command line client (&lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt;), that, comparing to querying the service directly with &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, has several useful features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Special shell mode with a persistent queries context and readline support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clipboard integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tab completion support for shells (bash, fish, zsh).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stealth mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install the client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    curl https://cht.sh/:cht.sh &amp;gt; ~/bin/cht.sh
    chmod +x ~/bin/cht.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can use &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, and write your queries in more natural way, with spaces instead of &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ cht.sh go reverse a list
    $ cht.sh python random list elements
    $ cht.sh js parse json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is even more convenient to start the client in a special shell mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ cht.sh --shell
    cht.sh&amp;gt; go reverse a list
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all your queries are supposed to be about the same language, you can change the context of the queries and spare repeating the programming language name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ cht.sh --shell
    cht.sh&amp;gt; cd go
    cht.sh/go&amp;gt; reverse a list
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or even start the client in this context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ cht.sh --shell go
    cht.sh/go&amp;gt; reverse a list
    ...
    cht.sh/go&amp;gt; join a list
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change the context, you can do it with the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command, or if you want do a single query for some other language, just prepend it with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ cht.sh --shell go
    ...
    cht.sh/go&amp;gt; /python dictionary comprehension
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to copy the last answer into the clipboard, you can use the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;) command, or &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ccopy&lt;/code&gt;, without comments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    cht.sh/python&amp;gt; append file
    #  python - How do you append to a file?

    with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) as myfile:
        myfile.write(&quot;appended text&quot;)
    cht.sh/python&amp;gt; C
    copy: 2 lines copied to the selection
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; for other internal &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;     cht.sh&amp;gt; help
        help    - show this help
        hush    - do not show the 'help' string at start anymore
        cd LANG - change the language context
        copy    - copy the last answer in the clipboard (aliases: yank, y, c)
        ccopy   - copy the last answer w/o comments (cut comments; aliases: cc, Y, C)
        exit    - exit the cheat shell (aliases: quit, ^D)
        id [ID] - set/show an unique session id (&quot;reset&quot; to reset, &quot;remove&quot; to remove)
        stealth - stealth mode (automatic queries for selected text)
        update  - self update (only if the scriptfile is writeable)
        version - show current cht.sh version
        /:help  - service help
        QUERY   - space ceparated query staring (examples are below)
                                  cht.sh&amp;gt; python zip list
                                  cht.sh/python&amp;gt; zip list
                                  cht.sh/go&amp;gt; /python zip list
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt; client has its configuration file which is located at &lt;code&gt;~/.cht.sh/cht.sh.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Use it to specify query options that you would use with each query. For example, to switch syntax highlighting off, create the file with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;QUERY_OPTIONS=&quot;T&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to use a special syntax highlighting theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;QUERY_OPTIONS=&quot;style=native&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;curl cht.sh/:styles-demo&lt;/code&gt; to see all supported styles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tab completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To activate tab completion support for &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt;, add the &lt;code&gt;:bash_completion&lt;/code&gt; script to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    $ curl https://cheat.sh/:bash_completion &amp;gt; ~/.bash.d/cht.sh
    $ . ~/.bash.d/cht.sh
    $ # and add . ~/.bash.d/cht.sh to ~/.bashrc
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stealth mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important properties of any real cheat sheet, is that it could be used fully unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheat.sh can be used completely unnoticed too. The cheat.sh client, &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt;, has a special mode, called &lt;strong&gt;stealth mode&lt;/strong&gt;. Using that you don't even need to touch your keyboard to open a cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this mode, as soon as you select some text with the mouse (and thus it is added into the selection buffer of X Window System or into the clipboard) it's used as a query string for cheat.sh, and the correspondent cheat sheet is automatically shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine, that you are having an online interview, where your interviewer asks you some questions using a shared document (say Google Docs) and you are supposed to write your coding answers there (it's possible too that you'll type in the questions on your own, just to show to the interviewer that you've heard it right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using the stealth mode of &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt;, the only thing you need to do in order to see a cheat sheet for some question, is to select the question using the mouse. If you don't want any text in the answers and the only thing you need is code, use the &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; option when starting the stealth mode.&lt;/p&gt;

You: itertools                                      |
She: Yes, you may use it                            |

She: Good. Let's try something harder.              |
She: What about quicksort implementation?           |
You: (selecting &quot;quicksort implementation&quot;)         | stealth: quicksort implementation
You: Let me think about it.                         | (some big and clumsy lowlevel implementation shown)
You: Well...(starting typing it in)                 | def sort(array=[12,4,5,6,7,3,1,15]):

She: (seeing your ugly pascal style)                |     equal = []
She: Could you write it more concise?               |     greater = []
                                                    |     if len(array) &amp;gt; 1:

                                                    |         for x in array:

She: do you really need all these ifs and fors?     |             if x == pivot: equal.append(x)
She: Could you may be just use filter instead?      |             if x &amp;gt; pivot: greater.append(x)

You: (selecting &quot;quicksort with filter&quot;)            | stealth: quicksort with filter
You: Ok, I will try.                                | return qsort(filter(lt, L[1:]))+[pivot] \
You: Something like this?                           |     +qsort(filter(ge, L[1:]))
You: qsort(filter(lt, L[1:]))+[pivot] \             |
       + qsort(filter(ge, L[1:]))                   |
                                                    |
She: Yes! Perfect! Exactly what I wanted to see!    |
                                                    |

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is just fun, and you should never cheat in your coding interviews, because you know what happens when you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5b9b2100a3238483a4158af57663f138f8aed651/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f7768656e2d796f752d6c69652d6b61747a652e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5b9b2100a3238483a4158af57663f138f8aed651/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f7768656e2d796f752d6c69652d6b61747a652e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;when you lie in your interview&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://cheat.sh/files/when-you-lie-katze.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editors integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;em&gt;cheat.sh&lt;/em&gt; directly from the editor (&lt;em&gt;Vim&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Emacs&lt;/em&gt; are currently supported). Instead of opening your browser, googling, browsing Stack Overflow and eventually copying the code snippets you need into the clipboard and later pasting them into the editor, you can achieve the same instantly and without leaving the editor at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what it looks like in Vim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a question while editing a program, you can just type your question directly in the buffer and press &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KK&lt;/code&gt;. You will get the answer to your question in pager. (with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KB&lt;/code&gt; you'll get the answer in a separate buffer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like the answer, you can manually paste it from the buffer or the pager, or if you are lazy you can use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KP&lt;/code&gt; to paste it below/under your question (or replace you question using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KR&lt;/code&gt;). If you want the answer without the comments, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KC&lt;/code&gt; replays the last query toggling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use some static analysis plugin such as &lt;em&gt;syntastic&lt;/em&gt; (for Vim), you can use its warning and error messages as cheat.sh queries: place the cursor on the problem line and press &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;KE&lt;/code&gt;: explanation for the warning will be opened in a new buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Vim configuration example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&quot; some configuration above ...

let mapleader=&quot; &quot;

call vundle#begin()
Bundle 'gmarik/vundle'
Bundle 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Bundle 'dbeniamine/cheat.sh-vim'
call vundle#end()

let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = [ 'jshint' ]
let g:syntastic_ocaml_checkers = ['merlin']
let g:syntastic_python_checkers = ['pylint']
let g:syntastic_shell_checkers = ['shellcheck']

&quot; some configuration below ...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, several Vim plugins are used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntastic shows warnings and errors (found by code analysys tools: &lt;code&gt;jshint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;merlin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pylint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shellcheckt etc.), and&lt;/code&gt;cheat.sh-vim` shows you explanations for the errors and warnings and answers on programming languages queries written in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch a demo, where the most important features of the cheat.sh Vim plugin are shown (5 Min):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davep/cheat-sh.el&quot;&gt;cheat-sh.el&lt;/a&gt; — Emacs support (available also at cheat.sh/:emacs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cheat.sh/:emacs-ivy — Emacs support for ivy users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/3xvqwrsu9g4taj5w526sb2t35&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/14144a54a82dbc9cd0ebd7aa7d17932922016758/68747470733a2f2f61736369696e656d612e6f72672f612f337876717772737539673474616a35773532367362327433352e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;asciicast&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/3xvqwrsu9g4taj5w526sb2t35.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several special pages (their names are always starting with a colon), that are not cheat sheets and have special meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    :help               description of all special pages and options
    :intro              cheat.sh introduction, covering the most important usage questions
    :list               list all cheat sheets (can be used in a subsection too: /go/:list)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command line client &lt;code&gt;cht.sh&lt;/code&gt; and shells support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    :cht.sh             code of the cht.sh client
    :bash_completion    bash function for tab completion
    :bash               bash function and tab completion setup
    :fish               fish function and tab completion setup
    :zsh                zsh function and tab completion setup
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    :vim                cheat.sh support for Vim
    :emacs              cheat.sh function for Emacs
    :emacs-ivy          cheat.sh function for Emacs (uses ivy)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    :post               how to post new cheat sheet
    :styles             list of color styles
    :styles-demo        show color styles usage examples
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search for a keyword, use the query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    /~keyword
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case search is not recursive — it is conducted only in a pages of the specified level. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    /~snapshot          look for snapshot in the first level cheat sheets
    /scala/~currying     look for currying in scala cheat sheets
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a recursive search in all cheat sheets, use double slash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    /~snapshot/r         look for snapshot in all cheat sheets
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use special search options after the closing slash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    /~shot/bi           case insensitive (i), word boundaries (b)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of search options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    i   case insensitive search
    b   word boundaries
    r   recursive search
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programming languages cheat sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheat sheets related to programming languages are organized in namespaces (subdirectories), that are named according to the programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each supported programming language there are several special cheat sheets: its own sheet, &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:learn&lt;/code&gt;. Say for lua it will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    lua
    lua/hello
    lua/:list
    lua/:learn
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages has the one-liners-cheat sheet, &lt;code&gt;1line&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    perl/1line
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; describes how you can start with the language — install it if needed, build and run its programs, and it shows the &quot;Hello world&quot; program written in the language;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:list&lt;/code&gt; shows all topics related to the language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:learn&lt;/code&gt; shows a learn-x-in-minutes language cheat sheet perfect for getting started with the language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1line&lt;/code&gt; is a collection of one-liners in this language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;weirdness&lt;/code&gt; is a collection of examples of weird things in this language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f0d4f6b68e1831faa07500a6867729b00818d63f/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f737570706f727465642d6c616e6775616765732d632b2b2e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f0d4f6b68e1831faa07500a6867729b00818d63f/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f737570706f727465642d6c616e6775616765732d632b2b2e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;cheat.sh usage&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://cheat.sh/files/supported-languages-c++.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, cheat.sh covers the 55 following programming languages (alphabetically sorted):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Prefix&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Basics&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;One-liners&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Weirdness&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cheat sheets sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating yet another mediocre cheat sheet repository, we are concentrating our efforts on creation of a unified mechanism to access selected existing well developed and good maintained cheat sheet repositories covering topics of our interest: programming and operating systems usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cheat.sh&lt;/em&gt; uses selected community driven cheat sheet repositories and information sources, maintained by thousands of users, developers and authors all over the world (in the &lt;em&gt;Users&lt;/em&gt; column number of contributors/number of stars is shown):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pie diagram reflecting cheat sheets sources distribution (by number of cheat sheets on cheat.sh originating from a repository):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to edit a cheat sheet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit a cheat.sh cheat sheet, you should edit it in the upstream repository. You will find the name of the source repository in a browser, when you open a cheat sheet. There are two github buttons in the bottom of the page: the second one is the button of the repository, whom belongs the current cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can edit the cheat sheet directly in your browser (you need a github account for it). There is a edit button in the top right corner. If you click on it, an editor will be open. There you will change the cheat sheet (under the hood: the upstrem repository is forked, your changes are committed in the forked repository, a pull request to the upstream repository owner is sent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a2549ceb6e4a95913d1a8488efc491a71b17d109/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f656469742d63686561742d73686565742e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a2549ceb6e4a95913d1a8488efc491a71b17d109/687474703a2f2f63686561742e73682f66696c65732f656469742d63686561742d73686565742e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;cheat.sh cheat sheets repositories&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://cheat.sh/files/edit-cheat-sheet.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to add a cheat sheet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to add a cheat sheet, you have one of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add it to one of the external cheat sheets repositories; you should decide on your own what is the best repository for your cheat sheet;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add it to the local cheat.sh repository (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sheets&quot;&gt;cheat.sheets&lt;/a&gt;) on github (fork, commit, pull request);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post it on cheat.sh using curl or a web browser (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cheat.sh/:post&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cheat.sh/:post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to change an existing cheat sheet, you have to find the original repository (when you open a cheat sheet in a browser, you see the repository's github button in the bottom of the cheat sheet), the cheat sheet is coming from, and change it there. After some time the changes will be synchronized on cheat.sh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to add a cheat sheet repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to add a cheat sheet repository to cheat.sh, please open an issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please specify the name of the repository, and give its short description.&lt;/p&gt;
