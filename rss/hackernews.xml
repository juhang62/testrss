Yet i’m being asked to write 4,000 word articles describing and comparing my product with the competition. Why? Because SEO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blockParagraph-544a408c&quot; data-key=&quot;4cbdee95b18942bc88b74b7c85f64253&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text-4505230f--TextH400-3033861f--textContentFamily-49a318e1&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-key=&quot;f199d34644f74fa48d5b40762cbf341f&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;f199d34644f74fa48d5b40762cbf341f:0&quot;&gt;I’m being wooed by a couple of ‘SEO Consultants’ who claim their expertise is guaranteed to get me on to the first page of a Search Engine’s results. They claim a ‘multi-pronged’ strategy. First they check my website to make sure it has all the appropriate tags, keywords, descriptors. That taken care of, they have a bunch of blogs where they will write articles about my product. Then they will get a bunch of ‘paid-influencers’ to write articles about my product. Simultaneously they have a team that posts questions about my product (and the answers) on Quora and other social media forums - basically seeding a link of my site on as many other sites as they can get hold of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blockParagraph-544a408c&quot; data-key=&quot;b70e5417992b47658e17a67628afc51a&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text-4505230f--TextH400-3033861f--textContentFamily-49a318e1&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-key=&quot;2562019cba4f4e29baed948d1afecece&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;2562019cba4f4e29baed948d1afecece:0&quot;&gt;All these and one final trick of trade. That is to set up an ad account and pay the Search Engine to show my site at the top of search results. Why? Because there’s so much competition in my line of business and i need the initial paid traffic. The logic peddled is once i start paying the ‘search tax’ more people will start clicking my link, and in a few months my site will start to show up organically in the first page of search results. Of course, it’s never just a few months. I must pay to stay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Simple. To trick or treat the Search Engine into assuming my product is popular. With many different people (and sock puppets) writing and talking about my product, the Search Engine assumes my product is popular and slowly starts bubbling it up in search results. Does this work? ABSOLUTELY - according to the SEO Consultants. They present their proof. I’m blown by their confidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blockParagraph-544a408c&quot; data-key=&quot;2d744ed1e9414c228ede54f7895558c4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text-4505230f--TextH400-3033861f--textContentFamily-49a318e1&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-key=&quot;f58483055d3548a0900364ba6a3c2ecd&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;f58483055d3548a0900364ba6a3c2ecd:0&quot;&gt;I like to think search ranking algorithms are not as complex and machine-intelligent as they’re made out to be. They just bubble up the most gossiped links. Search Engines need some kind of validation to decide what’s popular. What better validation than gossip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blockParagraph-544a408c&quot; data-key=&quot;280bfb2b1cff415aadab1101f426f00c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text-4505230f--TextH400-3033861f--textContentFamily-49a318e1&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-key=&quot;e6cae9f551a24272a459a4ac516cfb52&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;e6cae9f551a24272a459a4ac516cfb52:0&quot;&gt;And that’s what the internet has become. Full of gossip, junk content, paid posts, con articles, click bait links, sock-puppetry, spam, regurgitated spam, free e-books, self aggrandizement, fake followers, fake news, - all designed to achieve one thing - con the Search Engine - and you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It attracts the bottom feeders of the tech world. It’s easy to make a livelihood off of SEO. Why? Because it requires little skill. The startup costs are little. There’s a huge and easy market … lots of entrepreneurs who will grab at any straw of hope that promises to make their product more visible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMP for email is bad</title>
<link>https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/amp-email-bad-idea/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/amp-email-bad-idea/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/&quot;&gt;Accelerated Mobile Pages&lt;/a&gt;, or short AMP, is software to presumably make websites faster. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.googleblog.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html&quot;&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; by Google in 2015, and has now been added to Gmail. AMP in an email service makes the emails 'dynamic', at least that's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/&quot;&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-amp-in-emails-achieve-&quot;&gt;What does AMP in emails achieve?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically AMP is putting apps into an email to offer dynamic content: advertisements, shops, questionnaires, and similar content that can be interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's claim that AMP is necessary to make mobile pages load faster is just a marketing pitch. Or as &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/&quot;&gt;Devin Coldewey&lt;/a&gt; puts it: &quot;It’s like someone who sells bottled water telling you your tap runs too slow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites become faster if they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;don't load ads,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't autoplay videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't use lots of trackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is what Gmail's AMP now wants to do for the websites: load ads, autoplay videos, and track what you click on - directly in your Gmail inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-why-amp-is-bad&quot;&gt;Reasons why AMP is bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one asked for AMP, at least not the users. This is not surprising because AMP was never designed to deliver something the users needed, it was designed to enable Google to make Gmail more profitable. Here's why you should reject it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;News will be presented without branding: AMP is an attempt by Google to colonize free platforms such as web and email. Google should not be infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does AMP actually do with your mailbox? No ad blocker will help if your emails are delivered through Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketers and Google love AMP: Attempt to track you across platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building fast websites is easy: AMP doesn't magically make websites faster. Absence of trackers does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a reason why email is still around: One of the best things about emails is that they are persistent. They don't push advertisements into your face, they are always the same. Google is trying to fix something about emails, which isn't even broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-news-will-be-presented-without-branding&quot;&gt;1. News will be presented without branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's AMP is bad for another reason: As content shown in Google's AMP view is stripped of all branding even fake news will be displayed as if the content were from a legitimate news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make the problems we already have with fake news on the web even worse, potentially destroying our democracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google should not have the power to lock content into its platform and display it according to their algorithms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth&quot;&gt;The example of YouTube's clickbait algorithms already shows how harmful this can be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-what-does-amp-actually-do-with-your-mailbox-&quot;&gt;2. What does AMP actually do with your mailbox?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of visiting websites - where you can block advertisements with an ad-blocker - Gmail now wants to display this content directly in your mailbox, marketing it as an &quot;engaging, interactive, and actionable email experience&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ad blocker can stop the ads displayed in your Gmail inbox. Obviously, this is not to improve speed, but simply to track you across platforms. It is another colonialist attempt by Silicon Valley to take over the independent email platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email, however, is not an app platform or an ad platform, it is a communication medium. The way it is set up - decentralized and independent, it works well with delivering messages reliably from one person to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-marketers-and-google-love-amp&quot;&gt;3. Marketers and Google love AMP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers, on the other hand, love AMP: It allows them to display their shop directly in your inbox, making it quick and easy for you to buy something you don't actually need at a price that most likely isn't going to be the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever marketers love something, alarm bells must start chiming. And Google is just another marketer, of course. Google's motive with AMP is very simple: If you don't leave your Gmail inbox for shopping, for social interaction, for booking tickets, Google controls it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, you are leaving Gmail to do all these things on the web, and that's infuriating Google. They want to be in charge, and they want to make money with your purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because let's face it: Dynamic content in email has only one reason - ads. It's Google's business model for offering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/webmail-good-bad-secure&quot;&gt;free webmail&lt;/a&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-building-fast-websites-is-easy&quot;&gt;4. Building fast websites is easy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't need AMP for fast websites. Building fast websites is easy if you don't load ads, don't autoplay videos, and don't add lots of trackers to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP is only necessary to make websites that WANT to add all this make them relatively fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-there-s-a-reason-why-email-is-still-around&quot;&gt;5. There's a reason why email is still around&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email protocol was designed decades ago, and as much as everyone is complaining about how outdated it is, everyone is still using it for a very simple reason: It is easy and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fast and easy replacement for sending letters, when using encrypted emails it is also as secure as a sealed letter. But instead of making &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/gmail-end-to-end-encryption-is-dead&quot;&gt;encrypted email easy in Gmail&lt;/a&gt;, Google is again pushing for advertisement options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google now claims that because emails are static, they are bad. But the opposite it true: Only because emails are static, they can function as a replacement of a letter - even in a legal sense. Making it dynamic would destroy this benefit of emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tutanota-will-not-support-amp&quot;&gt;Tutanota will not support AMP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Tutanota we believe in a free and open Internet. AMP is the opposite. Google is trying to lock content into its own system to make a profit with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutanota will not support AMP. Our business model does not rely on irritating our users with targeted advertisements, but on offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/open-source-email&quot;&gt;open source emails&lt;/a&gt; that users are happy to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the best time to try Tutanota. We respect your right to privacy and don't post ads to your mailbox. Check here why Tutanota is a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutanota.com/gmail-alternative&quot;&gt;Gmail alternative&lt;/a&gt; and particularly why you should use Tutanota for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutanota.com/secure-business-email&quot;&gt;secure business emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FPGAs Have the Wrong Abstraction for Computing</title>
<link>https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/fpgaabstraction.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/fpgaabstraction.html</guid>
<description>&lt;aside&gt;These are notes from a short talk I’ll do at an “open mic” that some Microsoft folks are hosting at FCRC this weekend.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-computational-fpga&quot;&gt;The Computational FPGA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is an FPGA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the architecture community has a consensus definition. Let’s entertain three possible answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;An FPGA is a bunch of transistors that you can wire up to make any circuit you want.&lt;/em&gt; It’s like a breadboard at nanometer scale. Having an FPGA is like taping out a chip, but you only need to buy one chip to build lots of different designs—and you take an efficiency penalty in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t like this answer. It’s neither literally true nor a solid metaphor for how people actually use FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not literally true because of course you don’t literally rewire an FPGA—it’s actually a 2D grid of lookup tables connected by a routing network, with some arithmetic units and memories thrown in for good measure. FPGAs do a pretty good job of faking arbitrary circuits, but they really are faking it, in the same way that a software circuit emulator fakes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer doesn’t work metaphorically because it oversimplifies the way people actually use FPGAs. The next two definitions will do a better job of describing what FPGAs are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;An FPGA is a cheaper alternative to making a custom chip, for prototyping and low-volume production.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re building a router, you can avoid the immense cost of taping out a new chip for it and instead ship an off-the-shelf FPGA programmed with the functionality you need. Or if you’re designing a CPU, you can use an FPGA as a prototype: you can build a real, bootable system around it for testing and snazzy demos before you ship the design off to a fab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit emulation is the classic, mainstream use case for FPGAs, and it’s the reason they exist in the first place. The point of an FPGA is to take a hardware design, in the form of HDL code, and to buy cheap hardware that behaves the same as the ASIC you would eventually produce. You’re unlikely to take &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same Verilog code and make it work both on an FPGA and on real silicon, of course, but at least it’s in the same abstraction ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;An FPGA is a pseudo-general-purpose computational accelerator.&lt;/em&gt; Like a GPGPU, an FPGA is good for offloading a certain kind of computation. It’s harder to program than a CPU, but for the right workload, it can be worth the effort: a good FPGA implementation can offer orders-of-magnitude performance and energy advantages over a CPU baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a different use case from ASIC prototyping. Unlike circuit emulation, computational acceleration is an &lt;em&gt;emerging&lt;/em&gt; use case for FPGAs. It’s behind the recent Microsoft successes accelerating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-catapult/&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave/&quot;&gt;deep neural networks&lt;/a&gt;. And critically, the computational use case doesn’t depend on FPGAs’ relationship to real ASICs: the Verilog code people write for FPGA-based acceleration need not bear any similarity to the kind of Verilog that would go into a proper tapeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two use cases differ sharply in their implications for programming, compilers, and abstractions. I want to focus on the latter use case, which I’ll call &lt;em&gt;computational FPGA&lt;/em&gt; programming. My thesis here is that the current approach to programming computational FPGAs, which borrows the traditional programming model from circuit emulation, is not the right thing. Verilog and VHDL are exactly the right thing if you want to prototype an ASIC. But we can and should rethink the entire stack when the goal is computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gpufpga-analogy&quot;&gt;The GPU–FPGA Analogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be ruthlessly literal. An FPGA is a special kind of hardware for efficiently executing a special kind of software that resembles a circuit description. An FPGA configuration is a funky kind of software, but it’s software, not hardware—it’s a program written for a strange ISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a strong analogy here to GPUs. Before deep learning and before dogecoin, there was a time when GPUs were for graphics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/gpumatrixmult/gpumatrixmult.pdf&quot;&gt;In the early 2000s&lt;/a&gt;, people realized they could abuse a GPU as an accelerator for lots of computationally intensive kernels that had nothing to do with graphics: that GPU designers had built a more general kind of machine, for which 3D rendering was just one application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational FPGAs are following the same trajectory. The idea is to abuse this funky hardware not for circuit emulation but to exploit computational patterns that are amenable to circuit-like execution. In the form of an SAT analogy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;showcase&quot;&gt;GPU : graphics :: FPGA : circuit simulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To let GPUs blossom into the data-parallel accelerators they are today, people had to reframe the concept of what a GPU takes as input. We used to think of a GPU taking in an exotic, intensely domain specific description of a visual effect. We unlocked their true potential by realizing that GPUs execute programs. This realization let GPUs evolve from targeting a single &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; domain to targeting an entire &lt;em&gt;computational&lt;/em&gt; domain. I think we’re in the midst of a similar transition with computational FPGAs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;showcase&quot;&gt;GPU : massive, mostly regular data parallelism :: FPGA : irregular parallelism with static structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world hasn’t settled yet on a succinct description of the fundamental computational pattern that FPGAs are supposed to be good at. But it has something to do with potentially-irregular parallelism, data reuse, and mostly-static data flow. Like GPUs, FPGAs need a hardware abstraction that embodies this computational pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;showcase&quot;&gt;GPU : SIMT ISA :: FPGA : ____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s missing here is an ISA-like abstraction for the software that FPGAs run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rtl-is-not-an-isa&quot;&gt;RTL Is Not an ISA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Verilog for computational FPGAs is that it neither does a good job as a low-level hardware abstraction nor as a high-level programming abstraction. By way of contradiction, let’s imagine what it would look like if RTL were playing each of these roles well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verilog is an ergonomic high-level programming model that targets a lower-level abstraction.&lt;/em&gt; In this thought experiment, the ISA for computational FPGAs is something at a lower level of abstraction than RTL: netlists or bitstreams, for example. Verilog is the more productive, high-level programming model that we expose to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even RTL experts probably don’t believe that Verilog is a productive way to do mainstream FPGA development. It won’t propel programmable logic into the mainstream. RTL design may seem friendly and familiar to veteran hardware hackers, but the productivity gap with software languages is immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verilog is a low-level abstraction for FPGA hardware resources.&lt;/em&gt; That is, Verilog is to an FPGA as an ISA is to a CPU. It may not be convenient to program in, but it’s a good target for compilers from higher-level languages because it directly describes what goes on in the hardware. And it’s the programming language of last resort for when you need to eke out the last few percentage points of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, Verilog is the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; ISA for today’s computational FPGAs. The major FPGA vendors’ toolchains take Verilog as input, and compilers from higher-level languages emit Verilog as their output. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.megacz.com/thoughts/bitstream.secrecy.html&quot;&gt;Vendors keep bitstream formats secret&lt;/a&gt;, so Verilog is as low in the abstraction hierarchy as you can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Verilog as an ISA is that it is too far removed from the hardware. The abstraction gap between RTL and FPGA hardware is enormous: it traditionally contains at least synthesis, technology mapping, and place &amp;amp; route—each of which is a complex, slow process. As a result, the compile/edit/run cycle for RTL programming on FPGAs takes hours or days and, worse still, it’s unpredictable: the deep stack of toolchain stages can obscure the way that changes in RTL will affect the design’s performance and energy characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good ISA should directly expose unvarnished truth about the underlying hardware. Like an assembly language, it need not be convenient to program in. But also like assembly, it should be extremely fast to compile and yield predictable results. If there’s going to be a hope of building higher-level abstractions and compilers, they’re going to need such a low-level target that’s free of surprises. RTL is not that target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-abstraction&quot;&gt;The Right Abstraction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what abstraction should replace RTL for computational FPGAs. Practically, replacing Verilog may be impossible as long as the FPGA vendors keep their lower-level abstractions secret and their sub-RTL toolchains proprietary. The long-term resolution to this problem might only come when the hardware evolves, as GPUs once did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;showcase&quot;&gt;GPU : GPGPU :: FPGA : ____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If computational FPGAs are accelerators for a particular class of algorithmic patterns, there’s no reason to believe that today’s FPGAs are the ideal implementation of that goal. A new category of hardware that beats FPGAs at their own game could bring with it a fresh abstraction hierarchy. The new software stack should dispense with FPGAs’ circuit emulation legacy and, with it, their RTL abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>FPGAs Have the Wrong Abstraction</og:title>
<og:description>Verilog is the de facto abstraction for programming today’s FPGAs. RTL programming is fine if you want to use FPGAs for their traditional purpose as circuit emulators, but it’s not the right thing for the new view of FPGAs as general-purpose computational accelerators.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;author-image-container center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/assets/images/khaliq-gant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kjg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-date center&quot; id=&quot;15-june-2019&quot;&gt;15 June 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;js-read-time time center&quot;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author-intro&quot;&gt;Khaliq Gant is the creator of this website and a full stack web developer of over 8 years. He thinks it’s weird to write in the third person about himself but will continue because it’s now too late since he started this way. He works for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.happycog.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Happy Cog&lt;/a&gt; and currently resides in Paris where he enjoys a baguette at least once every three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Being a web developer means having a good grasp on a wide array of topics: navigating the terminal, html, css, javascript, cloud infrastructure, deployment strategies, databases, HTTP protocols and that’s just the beginning. There have been attempts to document &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;everything a web developer should know&lt;/a&gt;, and the list is quite long. Being able to memorize and know everything extremely well is both daunting and nearly impossible. Therefore, at a certain point there is an advantage to not even trying to know everything but rather just become really efficient at finding the answer to what you need. Being able to search &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/social-posts/searching-stackoverflow/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/social-posts/google-search-tips/&quot;&gt;google efficiently&lt;/a&gt; are truly skills that are essential in such a vast field as web development. Therefore, I maintain that I’m not really a good web developer, but rather just good at Googling things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image center top-space&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/assets/images/researching.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;research&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-clarify&quot;&gt;Let’s Clarify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;There is a ridiculous amount of information out there about web development and it is easy to drown in all the various websites and tutorials. Being able to navigate and know which article is best for your particular need is a very difficult task. Being a good web developer means you know how to search exactly for what you’re looking for and being able to differentiate between different resources that Google claims have the answer to your question. Having the baseline knowledge to write an efficient query into Stackoverflow takes years of knowledge and training, let alone being able to parse what the top answer is telling you and implement that. So, don’t get me wrong here, being able to research well is one thing, but you need a base skillset in web development to be able to interpret what you’ve found and put it to action. Part of being a good web development is being able to assimilate lots of information, combine it and put it towards your problem to solve it in an elegant and understandable way for your future self and other web developers on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-be-learned-from-my-most-recent-google-web-development-searches&quot;&gt;What Can Be Learned From My Most Recent Google Web Development Searches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;Let’s take a look at all my most recent Google Searches. Welllll, not all my most recent Google searches because…that is &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; out of the scope of this article. Let’s focus on just my most recent web development queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/assets/images/googling/git-flows.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-search&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;These are very specific queries about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;git flow&lt;/a&gt; where I was in a discussion with someone and trying to explain why I’m not always a fan of Git Flow. It took me to quite a few articles that helped me formulate my argument that I was previously having trouble putting into words. What can we take away from this query? It’s very specific and uses a very specific term “GitFlow” that will help focus my search results instead of showing general results about git itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/assets/images/googling/viewport-height.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-search-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;I was doing this google search for this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dev-diaries.com/social-posts/viewport-units/&quot;&gt;dev diaries post about viewport heights&lt;/a&gt; and compiling information. Again, this query is very specific and I’m filtering through some noise by including “css” in the query and using very specific language to find what I’m looking for. If I didn’t firstly have that vocabulary to even know what I’m looking for, my search results would be much more varied and noise filled, because I wouldn’t be able to accurately tell Google what I’m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;Ok, that was a fun little exercise – enough spying on my previous self and his Google searches…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;A web developer has a wealth of information at her or his fingertips. The trick is being able to access that information quickly and efficiently. A good web developer is organized, structured, analytical, and knows when he/she can cut corners. Knowing where and how to find something instead of stuffing your head is one of the best shortcuts you can take to make your life as a web developer easier. The other is documenting what you find and taking good notes once you do find that answer that you were looking for. One of the best and most valuable things I do is basically write doing everything. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://boostnote.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boostnote&lt;/a&gt; and know of many other developers who use &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;. The medium isn’t as important as the simple fact that notes are taken systematically and regularly. Having a place where you can write little snippets, notes, todos, and reminders is one of the most valuable things you can do as a web developer. Hell, that’s one of the reasons I started this website - not only to help others, but also myself. A developer has to juggle lots of different things on a day to day basis and it’s nearly impossible to remember everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The things I have found that have helped me develop most as a web developer over the years is being able to know how to find what I’m looking for, being able to parse what I’m reading, and make conclusions off of the information I’m taking in. Then after, noting my solution for future reference. After many years of doing this, I have a wealth of proven knowledge, resources and most importantly a process for assimilating information. So yes, I’m less so a good developer, but more so good at googling information and compiling that information for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Give Firefox a chance</title>
<link>https://dev.to/dtroode/why-you-need-to-give-firefox-a-chance-5g5a</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dev.to/dtroode/why-you-need-to-give-firefox-a-chance-5g5a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We live in the era of browser monopoly. Google occupied the whole web by its Chrome. Chrome has more than 50% of users:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0wWS3NWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fz6tvstqupgup3ijw9t5.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0wWS3NWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fz6tvstqupgup3ijw9t5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Browsers top&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safari is on the second place just because of macOS popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, most of the developers choose between Chrome and Firefox. And in 2017 Mozilla released their updated version of Firefox — Firefox Quantum with new customization settings, better extensions support, privacy and what's more important — speed. 2x faster than old Firefox and faster than Chrome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d9fF_-rn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/oj5ozdji2frqxjg7oebs.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d9fF_-rn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/oj5ozdji2frqxjg7oebs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox Quantum vs Chrome&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox using their own new engine with new Quantum CSS and Quantum DOM rendering. A lot of explanations &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And Chrome uses a lot of memory, Firefox — less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Firefox has a lot of useful features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolaschevobbe/status/1135798960361263104&quot;&gt;showing useless CSS rules&lt;/a&gt; and supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-67-dark-mode-css-webrender/&quot;&gt;prefers-color-scheme: dark&lt;/a&gt; media rules, that Chrome supports only in beta now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhksd5Nx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mpf3dc4ndob5kiwfc4yo.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhksd5Nx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mpf3dc4ndob5kiwfc4yo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you scare about extensions? Now, most developers write their extensions for both Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final reason — stop the monopoly. Give a chance to other companies that smaller and you can see how frontend develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move all your bookmarks in Firefox for one week and try.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Startup idea checklist</title>
<link>https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with different startup ideas and needed a good checklist to think through them. There are great templates for this already: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apply.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;The YC application&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister&quot;&gt;internal press release&lt;/a&gt;, and Sequoia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/&quot;&gt;Writing a Business Plan&lt;/a&gt;. I found myself mixing and tweaking these templates because they don’t exactly match my model of the world, so I wrote up my own list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this list both to develop ideas and filter them. If you adopt it, be careful about using it as a filter. Remember that in the early stages, good ideas are very easy to kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you building?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;= 70 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;= 70 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the essence of their dissatisfaction? If they read this answer, would they say “thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way”?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;= 240 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1110538673873805314&quot;&gt;@benedictevans&lt;/a&gt;: “The iTunes Store solved a user problem. So did the App Store. And so did Spotify and Apple Music, and indeed Apple News. But what user problem is solved by Apple’s commissioning TV shows?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/&quot;&gt;Peter Drucker&lt;/a&gt;: Is the product being designed &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; the customer, or &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; the customer?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer explaining the product and how it eliminates their dissatisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1110915013085028353&quot;&gt;@BrianNorgard&lt;/a&gt;: No one cares about your product. Who built it, its features, the origin story — it’s all superfluous. People only find value in what your product can do for them right now. Save people time. Save people money. Give people an escape. The selfish hand will always govern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/&quot;&gt;Peter Drucker&lt;/a&gt;: Are you &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; doing the best you can to help the customer?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a blog post title for your product launch. Is it surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the next day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;= 70 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>Startup idea checklist</og:title>
<og:description>I’ve been tinkering with different startup ideas and needed a good checklist to think through them. There are great templates for this already: The YC application, Amazon’s internal press release, and Sequoia’s Writing a Business Plan. I found myself mixing and tweaking these templates because they don’t exactly match my model of the world, so I wrote up my own list.</og:description>

<title>Google Chrome has become surveillance software. It’s time to switch</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-to-switch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Geoffrey A. Fowler | The Washington Post Columnist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You open your browser to look at the web. Do you know who is looking back at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a recent week of web surfing, I peered under the hood of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and found it brought along a few thousand friends. Shopping, news and even government sites quietly tagged my browser to let ad and data companies ride shotgun while I clicked around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was made possible by the web’s biggest snoop of all: Google. Seen from the inside, its Chrome browser looks a lot like surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been investigating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/28/while-youre-sleeping-your-iphone-stays-busy-2/&quot;&gt;secret life of my data&lt;/a&gt;, running experiments to see what technology really is up to under the cover of privacy policies that nobody reads. It turns out, having the world’s biggest advertising company make the most-popular web browser was about as smart as letting kids run a candy shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me decide to ditch Chrome for a new version of nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, which has default privacy protections. Switching involved less inconvenience than you might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tests of Chrome versus Firefox unearthed a personal data caper of absurd proportions. In a week of web surfing on my desktop, I discovered 11,189 requests for tracker “cookies” that Chrome would have ushered right onto my computer, but were automatically blocked by Firefox. These little files are the hooks that data firms, including Google itself, use to follow what websites you visit so they can build profiles of your interests, income and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome welcomed trackers even at websites you’d think would be private. I watched Aetna and the Federal Student Aid website set cookies for Facebook and Google. They surreptitiously told the data giants every time I pulled up the insurance and loan service’s log-in pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look in the upper right corner of your Chrome browser. See a picture or a name in the circle? If so, you’re logged in to the browser, and Google might be tapping into your web activity to target ads. Don’t recall signing in? I didn’t, either. Chrome recently started doing that automatically when you use Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome is even sneakier on your phone. If you use Android, Chrome sends Google your location every time you conduct a search. (If you turn off location sharing it still sends your coordinates out, just with less accuracy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox isn’t perfect – it still defaults searches to Google and permits some other tracking. But it doesn’t share browsing data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla, which isn’t in the data-collection business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, web snooping can be annoying. Cookies are how a pair of pants you look at in one site end up following you around in ads elsewhere. More fundamentally, your web history – like the color of your underpants – ain’t nobody’s business but your own. Letting anyone collect that data leaves it ripe for abuse by bullies, spies and hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s product managers told me in an interview that Chrome prioritizes privacy choices and controls, and they’re working on new ones for cookies. But they also said they have to get the right balance with a “healthy web ecosystem” (read: ad business).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox’s product managers told me they don’t see privacy as an “option” relegated to controls. They’ve launched a war on surveillance, starting this month with “enhanced tracking protection” that blocks nosy cookies by default on new Firefox installations. But to succeed, first Firefox has to convince people to care enough to overcome the inertia of switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tale of two browsers – and the diverging interests of the companies that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cookie fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Chrome and Firefox were taking on Microsoft’s lumbering giant Internet Explorer. The upstart Chrome solved real problems for consumers, making the web safer and faster. Today it dominates more than half the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, many of us have realized that our privacy is also a major concern on the web – and Chrome’s interests no longer always seem aligned with our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s most visible in the fight over cookies. These code snippets can do some helpful things, like remembering the contents of your shopping cart. But now many cookies belong to data companies, which use them to tag your browser so they can follow your path like crumbs in the proverbial forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re everywhere – one study found third-party tracking cookies on 92 percent of websites. The Washington Post website has about 40 tracker cookies, average for a news site, which the company said in a statement are used to deliver better-targeted ads and track ad performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also find them on sites without ads: Both Aetna and the FSA service said the cookies on their sites help measure their own external marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blame for this mess belongs to the entire advertising, publishing and tech industries. But what responsibility does a browser have in protecting us from code that isn’t doing much more than spying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Mozilla debuted a version of Firefox that included anti-tracking tech, turned on only in its “private” browsing mode. After years of testing and tweaking, that’s what it activated this month on all websites. This isn’t about blocking ads – those still come through. Rather, Firefox is parsing cookies to decide which ones to keep for critical site functions and which ones to block for spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s Safari browser, used on iPhones, also began applying “intelligent tracking protection” to cookies in 2017, using an algorithm to decide which ones were bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome, so far, remains open to all cookies by default. Last month, Google announced a new effort to force third-party cookies to better self-identify, and said we can expect new controls for them after it rolls out. But it wouldn’t offer a timeline or say whether it would default to stopping trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not holding my breath. Google itself, through its Doubleclick and other ad businesses, is the No. 1 cookie maker – the Mrs. Fields of the web. It’s hard to imagine Chrome ever cutting off Google’s moneymaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cookies play a role in user privacy, but a narrow focus on cookies obscures the broader privacy discussion because it’s just one way in which users can be tracked across sites,” said Ben Galbraith, Chrome’s director of product management. “This is a complex problem, and simple, blunt cookie blocking solutions force tracking into more opaque practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other tracking techniques – and the privacy arms race will get harder. But saying things are too complicated is also a way of not doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our viewpoint is to deal with the biggest problem first, but anticipate where the ecosystem will shift and work on protecting against those things as well,” said Peter Dolanjski, Firefox’s product lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Mozilla said they’re working on fighting “fingerprinting,” a way to sniff out other markers in your computer. Firefox is already testing its capabilities, and plans to activate them soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making the switch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a browser is no longer just about speed and convenience – it’s also about data defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that Google usually obtains consent before gathering data, and offers a lot of knobs you can adjust to opt out of tracking and targeted advertising. But its controls often feel like a shell game that results in us sharing more personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside readability=&quot;2.1428571428571&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get breaking news and alerts with our free mobile app. Get it from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareane.ws/mercappleapp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apple app store&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/googleplaymercapp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt hoodwinked when Google quietly began signing Gmail users into Chrome last fall. Google says the Chrome shift didn’t cause anybody’s browsing history to be “synced” unless they specifically opted in – but I found mine was being sent Google, and don’t recall ever asking for extra surveillance. (You can turn off the Gmail auto-login by searching “Gmail” in Chrome settings and switching off “Allow Chrome sign-in.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sign-in shift, Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green made waves in the computer science world when he blogged he was done with Chrome. “I lost faith,” he told me. “It only takes a few tiny changes to make it very privacy unfriendly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to defang Chrome, which is much more complicated than just using “Incognito Mode.” But it’s much easier to switch to a browser not owned by an advertising company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Green, I’ve chosen Firefox, which works across phones, tablets, PCs and Macs. Apple’s Safari is also a good option on Macs, iPhones and iPads, and the niche Brave browser goes even further in trying to jam the ad-tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does switching to Firefox cost you? It’s free, and downloading a different browser is much simpler than changing phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Mozilla launched a new version of Firefox called Quantum that made it considerably faster. In my tests, it has felt almost as fast as Chrome, though benchmark tests have found it can be slower in some contexts. Firefox says it’s better about managing memory if you use lots and lots of tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Switching means you’ll have to move your bookmarks, and Firefox offers tools to help. Shifting passwords is easy if you use a password manager. And most browser add-ons are available, though it’s possible you won’t find your favorite.
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has challenges to overcome. Among privacy advocates, the nonprofit is known for caution. It took a year longer than Apple to make cookie blocking a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a nonprofit, it earns money when people make searches in the browser and click on ads – which means its biggest source of income is Google. Mozilla’s CEO says the company is exploring new paid privacy services to diversify its income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its biggest risk is that Firefox might someday run out of steam in its battle with the Chrome behemoth. Even though it’s the No. 2 desktop browser, with about 10 percent of the market, major sites could decide to drop support, leaving Firefox scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care about privacy, let’s hope for another David and Goliath outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon wins ‘.amazon’ domain name, aggravating South American region</title>
<link>https://theconversation.com/amazon-wins-amazon-domain-name-aggravating-south-american-region-and-undermining-digital-commons-118186</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/amazon-wins-amazon-domain-name-aggravating-south-american-region-and-undermining-digital-commons-118186</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon has a new means of dominating the market – one that threatens the economic interests of the people who call the original Amazon home. In May 2019, the online megastore secured the general top-level domain name “.amazon.” Anyone with the internet will recognise these domain types even if they don’t know the term. They’re the endings to website addresses, like “.com,” “.org,” and “.ac.uk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICANN – the organisation charged with overseeing the internet’s domain names – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/board-material/resolutions-2019-05-15-en#1.c&quot;&gt;gave exclusive rights&lt;/a&gt; to the US based company to administer “.amazon” domains, allowing the company to expand its branding opportunities. Businesses have been able to purchase these domain names since 2011, and Amazon’s application has been pending since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the delay is because Brazil and Peru &lt;a href=&quot;https://gac.icann.org/work-products/public/amazon-br-pe-58086-2012-11-20.pdf?version=1&amp;amp;modificationDate=1353452622000&amp;amp;api=v2&quot;&gt;argued against it&lt;/a&gt;. They said granting a private company exclusive rights to the domain would “prevent the use of this domain for purposes of public interest related to the protection, promotion and awareness raising on issues related to the Amazon biome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Brazil and Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela belong to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO). Collectively, the ACTO states &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/mendoza-to-chalaby-marby-05sep18-en.pdf&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; their territorial interests entitle them to be involved in governing “.amazon” domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN’s guidance limits the right of corporations to register certain geographic names, but not others. The list they use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/mendoza-to-chalaby-marby-05sep18-en.pdf&quot;&gt;generates absurd results&lt;/a&gt;. The Isle of Man receives the highest level of protection in the world, while Scotland receives significantly less. Regions like Mesopotamia and the Amazon receive no protection at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtldresult.icann.org/applicationstatus/applicationdetails:downloadapplication/984?t:ac=984&quot;&gt;Amazon was unwilling to share the .amazon domains&lt;/a&gt; with the ACTO states, arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the .amazon registry will be a single entity registry and for purposes which serve Amazon’s strategic business aims, the reserved names cannot be offered to Governments or other official bodies for their own use…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that Brazil could not, for example, use Brazil.amazon to &lt;a href=&quot;http://opiniojuris.org/2019/04/19/who-owns-the-amazon-and-how-many-kindles-would-you-pay-for-it/&quot;&gt;promote tourism in its poorer and more isolated states&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil and Peru successfully argued this was inappropriate to an intergovernmental body that is supposed to influence ICANN decisions. As a result, ICANN denied Amazon’s application. The company appealed this decision to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/irp-amazon-final-declaration-11jul17-en.pdf&quot;&gt;independent arbitration panel&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, the panel concluded that ICANN was too deferential to the governments. They ordered ICANN to reconsider the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, the company and the ACTO states have attempted to negotiate an agreement over the use of the term “.amazon.” When talks broke down, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/huseman-to-chalaby-17apr19-en.pdf&quot;&gt;Amazon suggested compromises&lt;/a&gt; that it felt represented the interests of both parties. The company relented on its earlier opposition to sharing “.amazon” names with the ACTO states, granting nine domain names – one for the ACTO organisation and one for each state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon also promised not to use domain names that are significant for the culture and heritage of the Amazonian region. &lt;a href=&quot;http://opiniojuris.org/2019/04/19/who-owns-the-amazon-and-how-many-kindles-would-you-pay-for-it/&quot;&gt;The company had previously proposed&lt;/a&gt; providing USD$5,000,000 worth of Amazon products and services as compensation to the states, but this offer was not included in the latest proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before last month’s Board meeting, ACTO asked for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/moreira-to-chalaby-18apr19-en.pdf&quot;&gt;decision to be postponed&lt;/a&gt; so that negotiations could continue. Instead, ICANN’s Board of Directors ended the negotiations and granted the company the exclusive rights to administer the ‘.amazon’ domains in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enclosing the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision highlights what can happen when domain names like “.amazon” are privatised. ICANN is fulfilling a role previously carried out by the US government, but the arbitration panel’s decision indicates that ICANN is no longer subjected to the oversight of any government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of states to effectively influence ICANN decisions can have a detrimental impact on human rights and environmental protection. In their resolution outlining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/board-material/resolutions-2019-05-15-en#1.c&quot;&gt;the Amazon decision&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no reference to the rights of indigenous peoples in the original Amazon, but these people will still be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/van-ho-doyle-to-chalaby-22apr19-en.pdf&quot;&gt;international human rights law&lt;/a&gt;, the indigenous peoples in the region should have been consulted. Exclusive use of “.amazon” will deprive them of using it for economic opportunities in their historical lands, such as eco-tourism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/van-ho-doyle-to-chalaby-22apr19-en.pdf&quot;&gt;We raised this in a letter to ICANN&lt;/a&gt; before the Board’s decision. The Board does not appear to have considered these issues, and a response from ICANN acknowledged receipt of the letter but didn’t address the substantive concerns over the rights of indigenous peoples. Amazon, meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.aboutamazon.com/press-releases&quot;&gt;has not issued a press statement&lt;/a&gt; on the subject since the ICANN decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its inception, the internet was a great equaliser. It meant large and small businesses could compete with one another on a level playing field. ICANN has been entrusted with administering the internet and protecting it. That means protecting its broader purpose in society. ICANN appears to have forgotten that part of its role. It now charges &lt;a href=&quot;https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/agb/guidebook-full-04jun12-en.pdf&quot;&gt;costs USD$185,000&lt;/a&gt; for a top-level domain name like “.amazon”. It’s not surprising that a company whose 2018 profits were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/amazon-tax-bill-2018-no-taxes-despite-billions-profit&quot;&gt;reportedly USD$11.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; – for which it paid no federal taxes – was able to purchase the domain before an indigenous community in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications for the future of the internet are troubling. What was a global commons may become an exclusive field where those who have the most can acquire more. Those who have the least meanwhile lose even the right to use the name of their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
