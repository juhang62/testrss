<title>A Linux sysadmin&amp;#039;s introduction to cgroups</title>
<link>https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cgroups-part-one</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cgroups-part-one</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-embed-button=&quot;resource_list&quot; data-entity-embed-display=&quot;view_mode:resource_list.link&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;resource_list&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;78d8f7ba-4831-497f-b66d-ec0bb740244e&quot; data-langcode=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embedded-entity--resources embedded-entity--resources--link&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;resource-list-linux-containers&quot; class=&quot;eck-entity mt-2 py-3 pr-3 border-top border-danger&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;Linux Containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've heard of this thing called cgroups, and you are interested in finding out more. Perhaps you caught mention of it while listening to a talk about containerization. Maybe you were looking into Linux performance tuning, or perhaps you just happened to be traversing your file system one day and discovered &lt;code&gt;/sys/fs/cgroups&lt;/code&gt;. Either way, you want to learn more about this functionality that has been baked into the kernel for quite some time. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and prepare to (hopefully) learn something you may not have known before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are cgroups?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webster's dictionary defines &lt;em&gt;cgroups&lt;/em&gt; as... Just kidding. I always hated listening to talks that started with boring dictionary definitions. Instead, I am going to attempt to distill the technical definition of cgroups down into something easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cgroups are a huge topic. I've broken this discussion down into a four-part series. Part one, this article, covers the fundamental concepts of cgroups. Part two examines CPUShare in greater depth. Part three, entitled &quot;Doing cgroups the hardway,&quot; looks at cgroup administrative tasks. Finally, part four covers cgroups as managed by systemd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, the Linux kernel is responsible for all of the hardware interacting reliably on a system. That means, aside from just the bits of code (drivers) that enable the operating system (OS) to understand the hardware, it also sets limits on how many resources a particular program can demand from the system. This is most easily understood when talking about the amount of memory (RAM) a system has to divide up amongst all of the applications your computer may execute. In its most basic form, a Linux system is allowed to run most applications without restriction. This can be great for general computing if all applications play nicely together. But what happens if there is a bug in a program, and it starts to consume all of the available memory? The kernel has a facility called the Out Of Memory (OOM) Killer. Its job is to halt applications in order to free up enough RAM so that the OS may continue to function without crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's great, you say, but what does this have to do with cgroups? Well, the OOM process acts as a last line of defense before your system comes crashing down around you. It's useful to a point, but since the kernel can control which processes must survive the OOM, it can also determine which applications cannot consume too much RAM in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cgroups are, therefore, a facility built into the kernel that allow the administrator to set resource utilization limits on any process on the system. In general, cgroups control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of CPU shares per process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limits on memory per process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block Device I/O per process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which network packets are identified as the same type so that another application can enforce network traffic rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more facets than just these, but those are the major categories that most administrators care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cgroups' humble beginnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel mechanism for fine-grained control of resources. Originally put forward by Google engineers in 2006, cgroups were eventually merged into the Linux kernel around 2007. While there are currently two versions of cgroups, most distributions and mechanisms use version 1, as it has been in the kernel since 2.6.24. Like with most things added into the mainline kernel, there was not a huge adoption rate at first. Version 2 continues this trend, having been around for almost half a decade but still not widely deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue plaguing cgroup adoption is the lack of knowledge of its existence and its part in the modern Linux system. Low awareness and adoption often mean that the interaction with a kernel interface is clunky, convoluted, or just downright a manual process. Such was the case with cgroups initially. Sure, it's not that hard to create one-off cgroups. For example, if you wanted to simulate the early days before the tooling around cgroups was developed, you could create a bunch of directories, mount the &lt;code&gt;cgroup&lt;/code&gt; filesystem and start configuring everything by hand. But before we get to all that, let's talk a little bit about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; cgroups are vital in today's Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why cgroups are important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cgroups have four main features closely related to each other that make them very important in a modern system, especially if you are running a containerized workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Resource limiting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As touched upon earlier, cgroups allow an administrator to ensure that programs running on the system stay within certain acceptable boundaries for CPU, RAM, block device I/O, and device groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The device groups CGroup can be a key component in your system's comprehensive security strategy. Device groups include controlling permissions for read, write, and &lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; operations. The read/write operations are fairly self-explanatory, so let's take a moment to look at the &lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; functionality in a Linux system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; was initially designed to populate all of the things that show up in &lt;code&gt;/dev/&lt;/code&gt;. These are things like hard drives, USB interfaces for devices such as the Arduino, ESP8266 microcontrollers, or other devices that might exist on a system. Most modern Linux systems use &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; to automatically populate this virtual filesystem with things detected by the kernel. &lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; also allows multiple programs to communicate with each other by creating a named pipe. This concept is beyond the scope of this explanation, but it is sufficient to understand that this facilitates passing information from one program to another. Regardless, the &lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; in a controlled environment is something that an administrator should look closely at restricting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Prioritization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prioritization is slightly different than resource limiting because you are not restricting processes necessarily. Instead, you are merely saying that regardless of how many resources are available, process &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; will always have more time on the system than process &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Accounting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While accounting is turned off by default for most enterprise versions of Linux due to additional resource utilization, it can be really helpful to turn on resource utilization for a particular tree (more on this later). You can thus see what processes inside of which cgroup are consuming which types or resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Process control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a facility in cgroups called &lt;em&gt;freezer&lt;/em&gt;. While a deep understanding of this functionality is outside the scope of this article, you can think of freezer as the ability to take a snapshot of a particular process and move it. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/freezer-subsystem.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kernel Documentation&lt;/a&gt; for a deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what does this all mean? Well, from a system administrator's perspective, it means several things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, even without delving into container technology, it means that you can achieve greater density on a single server by carefully managing the type of workload, the applications, and the resources that they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it enhances your security posture quite a bit. While a typical Linux installation uses cgroups by default, it does not put any restrictions upon processes. You can impose restrictions by default if you so choose. You can also restrict access to specific devices for specific users, groups, or processes, which further helps to lock down a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can do a significant amount of performance tuning through cgroups. That, in combination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/power_management_guide/tuned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tuned&lt;/a&gt;, means that you can create an environment specifically adjusted for your individual workloads. At scale, or in a latency-sensitive environment, these adjustments can mean the difference between meeting or missing your Service Level Agreements (SLAs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do cgroups work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this discussion, we are talking about &lt;strong&gt;cgroups V1&lt;/strong&gt;. While version 2 is available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8), it is disabled by default. Most container technologies such as Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, and so on still rely on cgroups version 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed that cgroups are a mechanism for controlling certain subsystems in the kernel. These subsystems, such as devices, CPU, RAM, network access, and so on, are called &lt;em&gt;controllers&lt;/em&gt; in the cgroup terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each type of controller (&lt;code&gt;cpu&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blkio&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;memory&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) is subdivided into a tree-like structure. Each branch or leaf has its own weights or limits. A control group has multiple processes associated with it, making resource utilization granular and easy to fine-tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: Each child inherits and is restricted by the limits set on the parent cgroup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the diagram above, you can see that it is possible to have &lt;code&gt;PID 1&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;memory&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;disk i/o&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cpu&lt;/code&gt; control groups. The cgroups are created per resource type and have no association with each other. That means you could have a &lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt; group associated with all of the controllers, but the groups are treated independently. Like GIDs, these groups are assigned a numeric value upon creation and not a friendly name. Under the hood, the kernel uses these values to determine resource allocation. To think of it another way, assume that each cgroup name, once attached to a controller, is renamed to the name of the controller plus the name of your choosing. So a group called &lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;memory&lt;/code&gt; controller can actually be thought to be &lt;code&gt;memory-database&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, there is no relation to a &lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt; group associated with the controller &lt;code&gt;cpu&lt;/code&gt; as the friendly name can be thought of as &lt;code&gt;cpu-database&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a gross simplification and is NOT technically accurate should you be looking to get involved with the underlying cgroup code. The above explanation is meant for clarity of understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have an idea of what cgroups are and how they might help you with performance tuning and security. You also have a better understanding of how cgroups interact with controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is not a breakdown of all the controller types that exist in cgroups. Something on that scale would take an entire book to explain properly. In the next article, I look at CPUShares due to their relative complexity and the importance they play in the overall health of a system. The other controllers function similarly. Therefore, you should be able to take the lessons learned from the CPU controller and apply them to most of the remaining cgroup controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that in part three we'll examine administrative tasks and in part four we'll wrap up with how systemd interacts with cgroups.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>HP Instant Ink is “ink as a service”</title>
<link>https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/06/horrible-products/#inkwars</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/06/horrible-products/&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;xmasthead_link&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/06Nov2020.jpg?w=840&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/officespacepritnergiphy.gif?w=840&amp;amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot; class=&quot; jetpack-lazy-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/officespacepritnergiphy.gif?w=840&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP never stopped innovating. From its origins in the 1930s as a leading electronics manufacturer to its role in the birth of PCs and performance servers, it has always demonstrated incredible ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that ingenuity is deployed in service of evil ink-based fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer-ink business model has always been a form of commercial sadism in which you are expected to put giant manufacturers' interests ahead of your own with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer&quot;&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, when your profits depend on charging more for ink than vintage Veuve-Clicquot, you need to get up to some serious shenanigans to get your customers to drain their bank accounts to fill their printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contemporary standards, the opening hostilities in the ink-wars look positively quaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing special half-full cartridges to ship with new printers so their owners have to buy a new set just days after the open the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring frequent &quot;calibration&quot; printouts that use vast amounts of ink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gimmicking cartridges' sensors to declare them &quot;empty&quot; even when there's still ink in them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing is, all of this just makes official printer ink less desirable and fuels demand for third party ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, you need to win a two-front war: one on your customers and the other on your competitors. HP is fighting both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they pioneered the use of DRM to detect and prevent third-party ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when ink makers started making their own chips, or harvesting chips out of discarded cartridges to use in new ones, HP got US customs to seize the product, calling it a patent infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real ugliness started in March 2016, when HP pushed out a fake &quot;security update&quot; for inkjet printers. Owners who ran the update saw nothing, just a software version number that went up by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they didn't know was that they've been given an asymptomatic infection – a malicious update that only kicked in five months later, after everyone had had a good long time to update. That update's real purpose was to detect and reject third party ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It went off right after school started, stranding cash-strapped parents with a year's worth of ink for their kids' school projects. People were outraged. HP issued a nonpology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers&quot;&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One year later, they did it again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739&quot;&gt;https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time HP got caught doing something evil, they had the same excuse: &quot;that's the deal we offered and you accepted it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the box says &quot;Works best with HP ink,&quot; then you are &quot;agreeing&quot; that it might not work with other ink. Nevermind that the only reason your printer doesn't work with other ink is that HP tricked you into downgrading it so that the ink stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the grifter's all-purpose excuse: &quot;If you didn't want me to rip you off, then why did you click 'I agree'?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP was just getting started, though. In the ideal world, you wouldn't even own your printer ink, you'd just &lt;em&gt;rent&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter HP Instant Ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650&quot;&gt;https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &quot;ink as a service.&quot; You pre-commit to printing a certain number of pages/month and they mail you ink, which they own. You're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't print your quota in a month, some of the pages roll over, but they don't let you bank more than a few months' worth – and to keep those pages, you have to keep paying for your sub. Meanwhile, if you blow through your limit, you get charged for every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weird and unpalatable idea, so to sell it, HP rolled out a pay-on-price &quot;Free Ink for Life&quot; plan that gave you 15 pages every month for as long as you owned your printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot; class=&quot; jetpack-lazy-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is HP we're talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its &quot;free ink for life&quot; customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99/month, forever, or else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot; class=&quot; jetpack-lazy-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Darth Vader &quot;Pray I don't alter it further&quot; shit is the most on-brand HP thing ever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still are the many imitators HP inspires – all those companies that have decided that it's your solemn duty to arrange your affairs to suit their shareholders' needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the turn of this century, HP has been shedding its productive business units that make useful products, and focusing its legal and engineering departments on innovations in shitty dystopian hack-futurism.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Standing on our own two feet</title>
<link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When a new Certificate Authority (CA) comes on the scene, it faces a conundrum: In order to be useful to people, it needs its root certificate to be trusted by a wide variety of operating systems (OSes) and browsers. However, it can take years for the OSes and browsers to accept the new root certificate, and even longer for people to upgrade their devices to the newer versions that include that change. The common solution: a new CA will often ask an existing, trusted CA for a cross-signature, to quickly get it into being trusted by lots of devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, when Let’s Encrypt launched, that’s exactly what we did. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html&quot;&gt;We got a cross-signature from IdenTrust&lt;/a&gt;. Their “DST Root X3” had been around for a long time, and all the major software platforms trusted it already: Windows, Firefox, macOS, Android, iOS, and a variety of Linux distributions. That cross-signature allowed us to start issuing certificates right away, and have them be useful to a lot of people. Without IdenTrust, Let’s Encrypt may have never happened and we are grateful to them for their partnership. Meanwhile, we issued our own root certificate (“ISRG Root X1”) and applied for it to be trusted by the major software platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, those software platforms have trusted our root certificate for years. And the DST Root X3 root certificate that we relied on to get us off the ground is going to expire - on September 1, 2021. Fortunately, we’re ready to stand on our own, and rely solely on our own root certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does introduce some compatibility woes. Some software that hasn’t been updated since 2016 (approximately when our root was accepted to many root programs) still doesn’t trust our root certificate, ISRG Root X1. Most notably, this includes versions of Android prior to 7.1.1. That means those older versions of Android will no longer trust certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android has a long-standing and well known issue with operating system updates. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline&quot;&gt;lots of Android devices in the world running out-of-date operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. The causes are complex and hard to fix: for each phone, the core Android operating system is commonly modified by both the manufacturer and a mobile carrier before an end-user receives it. When there’s an update to Android, both the manufacturer and the mobile carrier have to incorporate those changes into their customized version before sending it out. Often manufacturers decide that’s not worth the effort. The result is bad for the people who buy these devices: many are stuck on operating systems that are years out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google no longer provides version numbers on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&quot;&gt;Distribution Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, but you can still get some data by downloading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/android-version-distribution-statistics-android-studio/&quot;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what the numbers looked like as of September 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/images/2020.11.06-android-version-distribution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Android Version Distribution as of September 2020&quot; title=&quot;Android Version Distribution as of September 2020&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, 66.2% of Android devices are running version 7.1 or above. The remaining 33.8% of Android devices will eventually start getting certificate errors when users visit sites that have a Let’s Encrypt certificate. In our communications with large integrators, we have found that this represents around 1-5% of traffic to their sites. Hopefully these numbers will be lower by the time DST Root X3 expires next year, but the change may not be very significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do about this? Well, while we’d love to improve the Android update situation, there’s not much we can do there. We also can’t afford to buy the world a new phone. Can we get another cross-signature? We’ve explored this option and it seems unlikely. It’s a big risk for a CA to cross-sign another CA’s certificate, since they become responsible for everything that CA does. That also means the recipient of the cross-signature has to follow all the procedures laid out by the cross-signing CA. It’s important for us to be able to stand on our own. Also, the Android update problem doesn’t seem to be going away. If we commit ourselves to supporting old Android versions, we would commit ourselves to seeking cross-signatures from other CAs indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a bind. We’re committed to everybody on the planet having secure and privacy-respecting communications. And we know that the people most affected by the Android update problem are those we most want to help - people who may not be able to buy a new phone every four years. Unfortunately, we don’t expect the Android usage numbers to change much prior to ISRG Root X1’s expiration. By raising awareness of this change now, we hope to help our community to find the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-are-a-site-owner&quot;&gt;If You Are a Site Owner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 11, 2021, &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/transition-to-isrgs-root-delayed-until-jan-11-2021/125516&quot;&gt;we’re planning to make a change to our API&lt;/a&gt; so that ACME clients will, by default, serve a certificate chain that leads to ISRG Root X1. However, it will also be possible to serve an alternate certificate chain for the same certificate that leads to DST Root X3 and offers broader compatibility. This is implemented via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-7.4.2&quot;&gt;ACME “alternate” link relation&lt;/a&gt;. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/certbot/certbot/releases/tag/v1.6.0&quot;&gt;supported by Certbot from version 1.6.0 onwards&lt;/a&gt;. If you use a different ACME client, please check your client’s documentation to see if the “alternate” link relation is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be site owners that receive complaints from users and we are empathetic to that being not ideal. We’re working hard to alert site owners so you can plan and prepare. We encourage site owners to deploy a temporary fix (switching to the alternate certificate chain) to keep your site working while you evaluate what you need for a long-term solution: whether you need to run a banner asking your Android users on older OSes to install Firefox, stop supporting older Android versions, drop back to HTTP for older Android versions, or switch to a CA that is installed on those older versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-get-let-s-encrypt-certificates-through-your-hosting-provider&quot;&gt;If You Get Let’s Encrypt Certificates Through Your Hosting Provider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hosting provider may be serving the DST Root X3 until September 2021, or they may decide to switch to the certificate chain that leads to ISRG Root X1 after January 11, 2021. Please contact them if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-use-an-older-version-of-android&quot;&gt;If You Use an Older Version of Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re on an older version of Android, we recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/&quot;&gt;install Firefox Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, which supports Android 5.0 and above as of the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does installing Firefox help? For an Android phone’s built-in browser, the list of trusted root certificates comes from the operating system - which is out of date on these older phones. However, Firefox is currently unique among browsers - it ships with its own list of trusted root certificates. So anyone who installs the latest Firefox version gets the benefit of an up-to-date list of trusted certificate authorities, even if their operating system is out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate your understanding and support both now and over the years as we continue to grow as a CA, making sure people everywhere have access to encryption. We will provide any future updates on how this root transition affects Android devices via &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/transition-to-isrgs-root-delayed-until-jan-11-2021/125516&quot;&gt;our community forum post&lt;/a&gt;. Our community is always ready to help should you have any questions about this change: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;community.letsencrypt.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We depend on contributions from our supporters in order to provide our services. If your company or organization would like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/&quot;&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt; Let’s Encrypt please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;sponsor@letsencrypt.org&lt;/a&gt;. We ask that you make an &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/donate/&quot;&gt;individual contribution&lt;/a&gt; if it is within your means.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Technical debt as a lack of understanding</title>
<link>https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Some time back, I was working on a project where it felt like the timebomb of technical debt was exploding in our faces. We couldn’t refactor the whoositz because of the whatsitz and when we asked about the whatsitz no one knew about the whatsitz and how it exactly worked with the whoositz and there certainly weren’t tests for it. When we notified management they replied, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2020/07/rebuild-the-plane-while-flying/&quot;&gt;We’re in a build the plane while flying situation&lt;/a&gt;, how can we get this out now without doing a big rewrite?” It was pretty clear how the technical debt had amassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This launched me on a bender exploring the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt&quot;&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt;. I knew what technical debt was, or rather &lt;em&gt;what it felt like&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn’t have a great way of explaining it that wasn’t purely subjective. “Code smells” are a great tell, but if “Code I don’t like” is the bar to qualify as technical debt, you’ll be refactoring the entire project every time you hire a new employee who has big opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some searching, I was pleased to find this short video by Ward Cunningham, the software programmer who originally coined the phrase “technical debt”, where he explains the concept a bit further…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you develop a program for a long period of time by only adding features but never reorganizing it to reflect your understanding of those features, then eventually that program simply does not contain any understanding and all efforts to work on it take longer and longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this definition that the problem lies in “never reorganizing [the code] to reflect your understanding.” In a go-go-go product cycle, that loss of understanding begins to create problems that have literal and figurative costs. A general sense of confusion builds and builds. The developer economics are fairly simple to quantify; either you slow down and pay someone to refactor and document the code after every major iteration, or you pay every developer who works on the project until the end of time to stare at the code for a few hours and wonder what the hell is going on. That dumbfounded staring at the codebase compounds over time. Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge management is so important in organizations, but they rarely undergo that critical step of reorganizing to reflect the current understanding. Need evidence? Take a look at your nearest corporate wiki. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/1323082503318626310?s=20&quot;&gt;I can almost guarantee it’s a mess&lt;/a&gt; because most companies should never have wikis. Successful wikis, like Wikipedia, are powered by an army of editors and most organizations will never prioritize that much time or content strategy. Poorly managed knowledge leaves organizations with the memory of goldfish. I can’t tell you how many new product initiative meetings I’ve been in where no one remembers the meeting about the exact same thing from two quarters ago. It’s like Groundhog’s Day, but you’re having the same meetings over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like about Cunningham’s understanding-based view of technical debt is that it leaves room to justify a big refactor when necessary. If there’s been enough organizational turnover or enough feature creep in a product, then maybe doing a rewrite is the best option so your team has a collective understanding of the code. You can’t expect people to be productive in something that was a culmination of rushed code, poorly understood requirements, and shortcuts made by people who no longer work there. At that point your technical debt balloon has popped, you are in possession of a toxic asset, and it’s time to pay the piper. And perhaps, with some agreed upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/16811&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/&quot;&gt;cheat entropy&lt;/a&gt; or build &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/2016/10/13/technical-credit&quot;&gt;technical credit&lt;/a&gt; instead of accruing debt or endlessly chasing the new shiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;I live in a &quot;Top 10 most dangerous cities in the U.S.&quot; What can I do to help? It seems like the most common solution for people who are educated and well off is to move. To get out of the situation, which is understandable. However, this causes a brain drain and leave the city in a worse place.
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to do that, I want to uplift if I can. What is the micro thing I can do today, that can have a chance of a macro change tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

<title>Gron – Make JSON Greppable</title>
<link>https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/tomnomnom/gron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7e52dc35c2f72ead040e57260cd07c271e3f30e/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f746f6d6e6f6d6e6f6d2f67726f6e2e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/tomnomnom/gron.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make JSON greppable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; for what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it. It eases the exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
▶ &lt;strong&gt;gron&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1&quot; | fgrep &quot;commit.author&quot;
json[0].commit.author = {};
json[0].commit.author.date = &quot;2016-07-02T10:51:21Z&quot;;
json[0].commit.author.email = &quot;mail@tomnomnom.com&quot;;
json[0].commit.author.name = &quot;Tom Hudson&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back into JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
▶ gron &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1&quot; | fgrep &quot;commit.author&quot; | &lt;strong&gt;gron --ungron&lt;/strong&gt;
[
  {
    &quot;commit&quot;: {
      &quot;author&quot;: {
        &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2016-07-02T10:51:21Z&quot;,
        &quot;email&quot;: &quot;mail@tomnomnom.com&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Tom Hudson&quot;
      }
    }
  }
]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: the GitHub API has fantastic documentation, but it makes for a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron has no runtime dependencies. You can just &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/releases&quot;&gt;download a binary for Linux, Mac, Windows or FreeBSD and run it&lt;/a&gt;. Put the binary in your &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;) to make it easy to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ tar xzf gron-linux-amd64-0.1.5.tgz
▶ sudo mv gron /usr/local/bin/
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a Mac user you can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://braumeister.org/formula/gron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;install gron via brew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ brew install gron
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you're a Go user you can use &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; (if you're using Go 1.7 or newer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/gron
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's recommended that you alias &lt;code&gt;ungron&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;norg&lt;/code&gt; (or both!) to &lt;code&gt;gron --ungron&lt;/code&gt;. Put something like this in your shell profile (e.g. in &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;alias norg=&quot;gron --ungron&quot;
alias ungron=&quot;gron --ungron&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could create a shell script in your $PATH named &lt;code&gt;ungron&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;norg&lt;/code&gt; to affect all users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gron --ungron &quot;$@&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get JSON from a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json 
json = {};
json.contact = {};
json.contact.email = &quot;mail@tomnomnom.com&quot;;
json.contact.twitter = &quot;@TomNomNom&quot;;
json.github = &quot;https://github.com/tomnomnom/&quot;;
json.likes = [];
json.likes[0] = &quot;code&quot;;
json.likes[1] = &quot;cheese&quot;;
json.likes[2] = &quot;meat&quot;;
json.name = &quot;Tom&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron http://headers.jsontest.com/
json = {};
json.Host = &quot;headers.jsontest.com&quot;;
json[&quot;User-Agent&quot;] = &quot;gron/0.1&quot;;
json[&quot;X-Cloud-Trace-Context&quot;] = &quot;6917a823919477919dbc1523584ba25d/11970839830843610056&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or from &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ curl -s http://headers.jsontest.com/ | gron
json = {};
json.Accept = &quot;*/*&quot;;
json.Host = &quot;headers.jsontest.com&quot;;
json[&quot;User-Agent&quot;] = &quot;curl/7.43.0&quot;;
json[&quot;X-Cloud-Trace-Context&quot;] = &quot;c70f7bf26661c67d0b9f2cde6f295319/13941186890243645147&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grep for something and easily see the path to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json | grep twitter
json.contact.twitter = &quot;@TomNomNom&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron makes diffing JSON easy too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ diff &amp;lt;(gron two.json) &amp;lt;(gron two-b.json)
3c3
&amp;lt; json.contact.email = &quot;mail@tomnomnom.com&quot;;
---
&amp;gt; json.contact.email = &quot;contact@tomnomnom.com&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of &lt;code&gt;gron&lt;/code&gt; is valid JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json &amp;gt; tmp.js
▶ echo &quot;console.log(json);&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; tmp.js
▶ nodejs tmp.js
{ contact: { email: 'mail@tomnomnom.com', twitter: '@TomNomNom' },
  github: 'https://github.com/tomnomnom/',
  likes: [ 'code', 'cheese', 'meat' ],
  name: 'Tom' }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also possible to obtain the &lt;code&gt;gron&lt;/code&gt; output as JSON stream via the &lt;code&gt;--json&lt;/code&gt; switch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ curl -s http://headers.jsontest.com/ | gron --json
[[],{}]
[[&quot;Accept&quot;],&quot;*/*&quot;]
[[&quot;Host&quot;],&quot;headers.jsontest.com&quot;]
[[&quot;User-Agent&quot;],&quot;curl/7.43.0&quot;]
[[&quot;X-Cloud-Trace-Context&quot;],&quot;c70f7bf26661c67d0b9f2cde6f295319/13941186890243645147&quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ungronning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron can also turn its output back into JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json | gron -u
{
  &quot;contact&quot;: {
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;mail@tomnomnom.com&quot;,
    &quot;twitter&quot;: &quot;@TomNomNom&quot;
  },
  &quot;github&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/tomnomnom/&quot;,
  &quot;likes&quot;: [
    &quot;code&quot;,
    &quot;cheese&quot;,
    &quot;meat&quot;
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Tom&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you use can use gron with &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; and other tools to modify JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json | grep likes | gron --ungron
{
  &quot;likes&quot;: [
    &quot;code&quot;,
    &quot;cheese&quot;,
    &quot;meat&quot;
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron --json testdata/two.json | grep likes | gron  --json --ungron
{
  &quot;likes&quot;: [
    &quot;code&quot;,
    &quot;cheese&quot;,
    &quot;meat&quot;
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve array keys, arrays are padded with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; when values are missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;▶ gron testdata/two.json | grep likes | grep -v cheese
json.likes = [];
json.likes[0] = &quot;code&quot;;
json.likes[2] = &quot;meat&quot;;
▶ gron testdata/two.json | grep likes | grep -v cheese | gron --ungron
{
  &quot;likes&quot;: [
    &quot;code&quot;,
    null,
    &quot;meat&quot;
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get creative you can do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/blob/master/ADVANCED.mkd&quot;&gt;some pretty neat tricks with gron&lt;/a&gt;, and then ungron the output back into JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wasn't this written in PHP before?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it was! The original version is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/blob/master/original-gron.php&quot;&gt;preserved here for posterity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the change to Go?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly to remove PHP as a dependency. There's a lot of people who work with JSON who don't have PHP installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why shouldn't I just use jq?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stedolan.github.io/jq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, and a lot more powerful than gron, but with that power comes complexity. gron aims to make it easier to use the tools you already know, like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gron's primary purpose is to make it easy to find the path to a value in a deeply nested JSON blob when you don't already know the structure; much of jq's power is unlocked only once you know that structure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jack Ma fell to earth and took Ant&amp;#039;s mega IPO with him</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;SINGAPORE/HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - They say talk is cheap. Tell that to Jack Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FILE PHOTO: Founder and Chairman of Chinese internet giant Alibaba Jack Ma gives a speech at Paris' high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech, in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Corporate China’s shiniest star was just days away from seeing his Ant Group list on the stock market in a record $37 billion deal, when he chose to launch a blistering public attack on the country’s financial watchdogs and banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The regulatory system was stifling innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth, billionaire Ma told a summit in Shanghai on Oct. 24 attended by the great and the good of China’s financial, regulatory and political establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Chinese banks, he said, operated with a “pawnshop” mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;It was this speech that set off a chain of events that ultimately torpedoed the listing of Ant, the fintech titan Ma founded, according to interviews with government officials, company executives and investors. They all requested anonymity to disclose confidential details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Stung by the attack, Chinese regulators and Communist Party officials set about reining in Ma’s sprawling financial empire, culminating in the suspension of the IPO on Tuesday, two days before the eagerly awaited market debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;While Ma might not have realised the impact his words would have, people close to him had been baffled to learn in advance about the tone of the speech he planned to deliver, according to two sources close to Ma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;They suggested the 56-year-old soften his remarks as some of China’s most senior financial regulators were due to attend, but he refused to budge, believing he should be able to say what he wanted, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“Jack is Jack. He just wanted to speak his mind,” said one of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;It was a costly miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Several senior financial regulatory officials were furious at Ma’s criticism, two sources told Reuters, with one source characterising the speech as a “punch in their faces”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;State regulators started compiling reports including one on how Ant had used digital financial products like Huabei, a virtual credit card service, to encourage poor and young people to build up debt, according to the two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The general office of the State Council compiled a report on public sentiment about Ma’s speech and submitted it to senior leaders including President Xi Jinping, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Some of the reports indicated public sentiment was negative on Ma and his remarks, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Top Chinese leaders then became more involved and asked for a thorough investigation of the company’s business activities, which eventually led to the halting of the world’s biggest IPO, three of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange，and the State Council Information Office did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Ma could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment and e-commerce group Alibaba, which handles media inquiries for Ma, did not respond to a request for comment on this story from its lead founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;Slideshow &lt;span&gt;( 2 images )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The chance of the flotation getting back on track in the near-term is slim, according to six of the people, as regulators look to tighten scrutiny of the company. No listing is expected for at least the next few months, two said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Headline-headline-2FXIq Headline-black-OogpV ArticleBody-heading-3h695&quot;&gt;SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;It was a stunning reversal for Ma, who would have added at least $27 billion to his net worth from the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;In years gone by, most regulators had left the billionaire to his own devices, partly because of his close ties to some senior government officials, according to five of the sources, but also because of national pride in his success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Ma, a former English teacher, is one of China’s internet pioneers, building an e-commerce empire with Alibaba and a fintech giant with Ant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;When the PBOC tried to regulate Ant’s payment and wealth management business about five years ago, Ma bypassed the central bank after failing to reach a consensus with regulatory officials and lobbied the central government. The PBOC later dropped those regulation plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“Jack Ma did not bypass the customary process of communicating with relevant regulators regarding Ant’s payment and wealth management business,” Ant’s spokeswoman said in an emailed response to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;But with his Oct. 24 speech, Ma misjudged the shifting priorities of Beijing, according to one senior regulatory source, believing he could challenge the financial establishment yet retain the support of the central leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The bigger picture was that one of the government’s main aims this year is to shore up the country’s financial sector and tighten regulatory oversight to prevent systemic risks in a pandemic-hit economy, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Even before Ma’s speech, Chinese regulators were gradually increasing their oversight of Ant, which has largely thrived as a technology platform free from costly banking regulations despite its bouquet of financial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The scrutiny has particularly intensified for the company’s rapidly growing online consumer-lending business, a cash cow, which sources demand from retail consumers and small businesses and passes that on to about 100 banks for underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Headline-headline-2FXIq Headline-black-OogpV ArticleBody-heading-3h695&quot;&gt;REGULATORS MAKE MOVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The Shanghai speech was the trigger for a major escalation, according to half of the dozen people interviewed, prompting senior political officials to ask regulators, including the central bank and China’s top banking regulator, for the thorough review of Ant’s businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The watchdogs, who had for years wanted to rein in Ma’s fintech empire, moved fast after receiving written instructions from officials including Vice Premier Liu He, a trusted economic adviser to President Xi, said two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment from Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;As part of this drive, regulatory officials rushed to publish a consultation paper this Monday to tighten rules for the country’s micro-lending business, which directly impacts Ant, said one person with direct knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The draft requires micro-lenders to fund at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks. Only 2% of the loans Ant had facilitated as of end-June were on its balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Top Chinese industry players including Ant and Lufax Holding Ltd, an online wealth management platform, were aware of the draft details weeks before its public release, said two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Lufax, which raised $2.4 billion in a New York IPO last month, had informed investors that regulators had required leading online micro-lenders to provide about 20%-30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks, according to two investors who joined its roadshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Lufax declined to comment due to quiet period restrictions following its IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;By contrast, Ant’s executives did not mention the possible regulatory changes during its two main calls with global investors during its roadshow last week, two other investors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Ant’s spokeswoman said the company was not aware of the details of the draft online micro-lending rules until they were published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Headline-headline-2FXIq Headline-black-OogpV ArticleBody-heading-3h695&quot;&gt;HUBRIS AND HUMILITY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;After the publication of the micro-lending consultation paper, Ma and the two top Ant executives were summoned to a rare joint meeting with four regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;They were told that the company, notably its consumer-lending business, would face tougher scrutiny over matters including capital adequacy and leverage ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Regulators had been surprised by the scale and risk model of Ant’s lending division, details of which were disclosed in the IPO-related filings since late August. The unit, which includes Huabei and short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei, contributed close to 40% of the group’s revenue in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;A day later, the Shanghai stock exchange said it had suspended Ant’s IPO, citing a “significant change” in the regulatory environment, prompting the company to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;China’s securities industry watchdog said subsequently that recent regulatory changes could have a “major impact” on Ant’s business structure and profit model. It said suspending the IPO was a responsible move both for investors and markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The suspension marked the nadir of what has been a gradually souring relationship over recent years between Ma’s corporate empire and Chinese regulators, from the central bank to the internet and markets watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;After the announcement, however, Ant released a statement in which it pledged to “embrace” regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“It has no alternative but to do so,” Gavekal Research analyst Andrew Batson wrote in a report this week. “Ma’s hubris has now morphed into humility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Corbet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 5, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command, which uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh_(Secure_Shell)&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; protocol to copy files between machines, is deeply wired into the fingers of many Linux users and developers — doubly so for those of us who still think of it as a more secure replacement for &lt;tt&gt;rcp&lt;/tt&gt;. Many users may be surprised to learn, though, that the resemblance to &lt;tt&gt;rcp&lt;/tt&gt; goes beyond the name; much of the underlying protocol is the same as well. That protocol is showing its age, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssh.com/&quot;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; community has considered it deprecated for a while. Replacing &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; in a way that keeps users happy may not be an easy task, though.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;, like &lt;tt&gt;rcp&lt;/tt&gt; before it, was designed to look as much like the ordinary &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; command as possible. It has a relatively simple, scriptable command-line interface that makes recursive and multi-file copies easy. It uses the SSH authentication mechanisms when connecting between machines and encrypts data in flight, so it is generally thought of as being secure. It turns out, though, that in some situations, especially those where there is little or no trust between the two ends of the connection, the actual level of security may be less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/786236/&quot;&gt;OpenSSH 8.0&lt;/a&gt; release, which included a fix for the vulnerability known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6111&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-6111&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; protocol, the side containing the file(s) to be copied provides the name(s) to the receiving side. So one might type a command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    $ scp admin:boring-spreadsheet.ods .
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the expectation of getting a file called &lt;tt&gt;boring-spreadsheet.ods&lt;/tt&gt; in the current working directory. If the remote server were to give a response like &quot;here is the &lt;tt&gt;.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file you asked for&quot;, though, &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; would happily overwrite that file instead. The 8.0 release fixed this problem by comparing the file name from the remote side with what was actually asked for, but the release announcement also stated that the &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; protocol is &quot;&lt;span&gt;outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and recommended migrating away from &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cpandya2909/CVE-2020-15778/&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-15778&lt;/a&gt; is a different story. Remember that &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; is built on SSH, so when one types a command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    $ scp election-predictions.txt dumpster:junk/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the result will be an SSH connection to &lt;tt&gt;dumpster&lt;/tt&gt; running this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    scp -t junk/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That command, using the undocumented &lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt; option to specify a destination (&quot;to&quot;) directory, will then handle requests to transfer files into &lt;tt&gt;junk&lt;/tt&gt;. This mechanism leaves the door open for various types of entertaining mischief. Try running something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    $ scp some-local-file remote:'`touch you-lose`remote-file'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will result in the creation of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; files on the remote system: the expected &lt;tt&gt;remote-file&lt;/tt&gt; and an empty file called &lt;tt&gt;you-lose&lt;/tt&gt;. Adding more interesting contents to that file is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this behavior constitutes a vulnerability is partly in the eye of the beholder. If the user has ordinary SSH access to the remote system, smuggling commands via &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; is just a harder way to do things that are already possible. Evidently, though, it is not unheard-of for sites to provide &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;-only access, allowing users to copy files but not to execute arbitrary commands on the target system. For systems with that sort of policy, this behavior is indeed a vulnerability. Finally, while the danger is remote, it is worth noting that a local file name containing `backticks` (a file named &lt;tt&gt;`touch you-lose`&lt;/tt&gt;, for example) will be handled the same way on the other end; if a user can be convinced to perform a recursive copy of a directory tree containing a file with a malicious name, bad things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike CVE-2019-6111, this problem has not been addressed by the OpenSSH developers. As quoted in the disclosure linked above, their response is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scp command is a historical protocol (called rcp) which relies upon that style of argument passing and encounters expansion problems. It has proven very difficult to add &quot;security&quot; to the scp model. All attempts to &quot;detect&quot; and &quot;prevent&quot; anomalous argument transfers stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows. Yes, we recognize it the situation sucks. But we don't want to break the easy patterns people use scp for, until there is a commonplace replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, the next question comes naturally: what should replace the deprecated &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; command? The usual answer to that question is either &lt;a href=&quot;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sftp.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;sftp&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;rsync&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;sftp&lt;/tt&gt; command has the advantage of being a part of the OpenSSH package and, thus, available in most places that &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; can be found. Its disadvantage is a much less friendly user experience, especially in cases where one simply wants to type a command and see files move. A simple command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    $ sftp * remote:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will not work as expected. Some uses require entering an &quot;interactive mode&quot; that is familiar to those of us old enough to have once used FTP for file transfers; we're also old enough to remember why we switched from FTP to commands like &lt;tt&gt;rcp&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; as soon as they became available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;rsync&lt;/tt&gt; is a capable alternative that has the advantage of performing better than &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;, which is not particularly fast. But &lt;tt&gt;rsync&lt;/tt&gt; is not as universally available as the SSH suite of commands; its GPLv3 licensing is also a deterrent to certain classes of users. Even when it is available, &lt;tt&gt;rsync&lt;/tt&gt; often feels more like the power tool that is brought out for large jobs; &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; is the Swiss Army knife that is readily at hand and good enough most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the simple matter that &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; is ingrained so deeply into the muscle memory of so many users. As with other deprecated commands (&lt;tt&gt;ifconfig&lt;/tt&gt;, say), it can be hard to make the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, it would be nice to have a version of &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; that doesn't suffer from the current command's problems. As it turns out, Jakub Jelen &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2020-June/038594.html&quot;&gt;is working on such a thing&lt;/a&gt;; it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jjelen/openssh-sftp/&quot;&gt;an &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; command&lt;/a&gt; that uses the &lt;tt&gt;sftp&lt;/tt&gt; protocol under the hood. At this point, it is claimed to work for most basic usage scenarios; some options (such as &lt;tt&gt;-3&lt;/tt&gt;, which copies files between two remote hosts by way of the local machine) are not supported. &quot;Features&quot; like backtick expansion will also not be supported, even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2020-August/038720.html&quot;&gt;some users evidently think&lt;/a&gt; that this expansion might have legitimate uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jelen has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/fedora-devel/5c5ff586-c5af-2375-d189-b72de444aa99@redhat.com/&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; switching the Fedora distribution to his &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; replacement; the responses have been mostly positive. Some users do worry that &lt;tt&gt;sftp&lt;/tt&gt; might be even slower than &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt;, but it doesn't appear that any serious benchmarking has been done yet. Even if it is a bit slower, a version of &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; that avoids the security problems with the current implementation while not breaking existing scripts (and set-in-their-ways users) seems like a welcome change. Perhaps one more piece of 1980s legacy can finally be left behind.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
