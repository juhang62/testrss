<title>Canada Border Services seizes lawyer&amp;#039;s phone, laptop for not sharing passwords</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbsa-boarder-security-search-phone-travellers-openmedia-1.5119017</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbsa-boarder-security-search-phone-travellers-openmedia-1.5119017</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As more people travel with smartphones loaded with personal data, concern is mounting over Canadian border officers' powers to search those phones — without a warrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The policy's outrageous,&quot; said Toronto business lawyer, Nick Wright. &quot;I think that it's a breach of our constitutional rights.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His thoughts follow a personal experience. After landing at Toronto's Pearson Airport on April 10, he said the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) flagged him for an additional inspection — for no stated reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright had just returned from a four-month trip to Guatemala and Colombia where he studied Spanish and worked remotely. He took no issue when a border services officer searched his bags, but drew the line when the officer demanded his passwords to also search his phone and laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright refused, telling the officer both devices contained confidential information protected by solicitor-client privilege.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said the officer then confiscated his phone and laptop, and told him the items would be sent to a government lab which would try to crack his passwords and search his files.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122107.1557086810!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/nick-wright-nicks-rocche-chavajay-in-san-pedro-la-laguna-guatemala.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Nick Wright poses with his Spanish instructor, Nicks Rocche Chavajay, in San Pedro La Laguna, Guatemala.  (submitted by Nick Wright)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my view, seizing devices when someone exercises their constitutional right is an affront to civil liberty,&quot; said Wright who's still waiting for the return of his phone and laptop. Meanwhile, he said he has spent about $3,000 to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officers can search your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CBSA-FOI-Docs.pdf&quot;&gt;According to the CBSA&lt;/a&gt;, it has the right to search electronic devices at the border for evidence of customs-related offences — without a warrant — just as it does with luggage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If travellers refuse to provide their passwords, officers can seize their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBSA said that between November 2017 and March 2019, 19,515 travellers had their digital devices examined, which represents 0.015 per cent of all cross-border travellers during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 38 per cent of those searches, officers uncovered evidence of a customs-related offence — which can include possessing prohibited material or undeclared goods, and money laundering, said the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4311888.1556906736!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/canada-syria-migrants.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;According to the Canada Border Services Agency, its officers have the right to search any goods crossing the border without a warrant -- including electronic devices.  (Mark Blinch/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the laws governing CBSA searches have existed for decades, applying them to digital devices has sparked concern in an era where many travellers carry smartphones full of personal and sometimes very sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of lawyers across Canada argue that warrantless digital device searches at the border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lawyers-canada-warrantless-smartphone-searches-customs-act-1.4247036&quot;&gt;are unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;, and the practice should be stopped or at least limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The policy of the CBSA of searching devices isn't something that is justifiable in a free and democratic society,&quot; said Wright who ran as a Green Party candidate in the 2015 federal election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's appalling, it's shocking, and I hope that government, government agencies and the courts, and individual citizens will inform themselves and take action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Out of date' laws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer advocacy group, OpenMedia is already taking action. It has launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://borderprivacy.ca/?utm_source=nom&amp;amp;utm_medium=slideshow&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=7169&amp;amp;utm_term&amp;amp;tdid=2104&quot;&gt;online and ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; to raise awareness about digital border searches and pressure the federal government to update the rules that govern them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These laws are incredibly, incredibly out of date,&quot; said OpenMedia privacy campaigner Victoria Henry. &quot;The way they treat our digital devices are as mere goods and that's the same classification as a bag of T-shirts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to see separate border rules for digital devices which stipulate reasonable grounds for a search. Henry also said those rules must be clearly laid out to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to have clear and transparent policies and mechanisms for recourse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122182.1556907917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/openmedia-ad-border-phone-search.JPG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;An example of an ad that OpenMedia plans to run, starting in June on the Vancouver Skytrain. (submitted by OpenMedia)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government says that its current policies are both reasonable and necessary to keep Canadian borders secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSA officers are directed to disable any internet connection and only examine content that is already stored on a device, said Scott Bardsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that digital searches &quot;should not be routine&quot; and that &quot;officers may only conduct a search if there are multiple indicators that evidence of contraventions may be found on a device.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said, in his case, no rationale was provided why his phone and laptop needed to be examined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were no factors that I'm aware of that would justify the searches.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Respect for privacy'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Safety spokesperson Bardsley also said that CBSA officers understand the importance of solicitor-client privilege and are instructed not to examine documents that fall within that scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CBSA officers are trained to conduct all border examinations with as much respect for privacy as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said that wasn't his experience. Instead, the officer he dealt with neither expressed knowledge of, nor responded to his concerns that his laptop and phone contained solicitor-client privileged documents, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;His response was only to demand the passwords to access both.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bardsley said that if travellers have issues or concerns, they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;submit a complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the CBSA. He added that the government is investing $24 million to enhance oversight by creating an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;independent review body&lt;/a&gt; for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright has already submitted his complaint to the CBSA which includes a demand for the immediate return of his phone and laptop, plus compensation for having to temporarily replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when he gets them back, his battle may not be over; Wright is now considering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it's important that we all stand up for our civil liberties and our charter rights,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch: What border officers can search on your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Often used as a way to encourage more user research in a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4180&quot; id=&quot;4180&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“If Henry Ford had asked people what they wanted, they would have told him faster horses”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Used as a counter-argument to the previous statement, when you start to realize you won’t have time or money to do enough user research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a91&quot; id=&quot;7a91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“We are testing the design, not your skills”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Disclaimer given to users at the start of a user testing session to make them feel better about being a little stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22ae&quot; id=&quot;22ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Designers should have a seat at the table”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When you are not able to prove your strategic value to the company based on your everyday actions and behaviors, and you have to beg to be invited to important meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd8a&quot; id=&quot;bd8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Choices should be limited to 7 plus or minus 2”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A nicer way of saying that choices should range from 5 to 9, without sounding too broad. When in reality every good designer knows choices should range from 1 to 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56f0&quot; id=&quot;56f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit; they want a quarter-​inch hole”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Wait, do they really want a hole? Or do they want wireless Bluetooth instead, so no holes are needed whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c077&quot; id=&quot;c077&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“UX should be a mindset, not a step in the process”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you realize the deadline is coming close and you haven’t been able to finish your deliverables.

&lt;p name=&quot;b794&quot; id=&quot;b794&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Never underestimate the stupidity of the user”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An efficient way of outsourcing your own responsibility of giving users enough context so they know what to do (a.k.a. being a good designer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;99b9&quot; id=&quot;99b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“I’m wondering if this breaks accessibility standards”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used as last resort when you are running out of arguments to convince other designers their design is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text parbase section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main_content&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People suffering from a debilitating and often discounted disease known as chronic fatigue syndrome may soon have something they’ve been seeking for decades: scientific proof of their ailment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have created a blood test that can flag the disease, which currently lacks a standard, reliable diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Too often, this disease is categorized as imaginary,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ronald-davis&quot;&gt;Ron Davis&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor of biochemistry and of genetics. When individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome seek help from a doctor, they may undergo a series of tests that check liver, kidney and heart function, as well as blood and immune cell counts, Davis said. “All these different tests would normally guide the doctor toward one illness or another, but for chronic fatigue syndrome patients, the results all come back normal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, he said, is that they’re not looking deep enough. Now, Davis; &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.uci.edu/users/rahim-esfandyarpour&quot;&gt;Rahim Esfandyarpour&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a former Stanford research associate; and their colleagues have devised a blood-based test that successfully identified participants in a study with chronic fatigue syndrome. The test, which is still in a pilot phase, is based on how a person’s immune cells respond to stress. With blood samples from 40 people — 20 with chronic fatigue syndrome and 20 without — the test yielded precise results, accurately flagging all chronic fatigue syndrome patients and none of the healthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnostic platform could even help identify possible drugs to treat chronic fatigue syndrome. By exposing the participants’ blood samples to drug candidates and rerunning the diagnostic test, the scientists could potentially see whether the drug improved the immune cells’ response. Already, the team is using the platform to screen for potential drugs they hope can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper describing the research findings was published online April 29 in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Davis is the senior author. Esfandyarpour, who is now on the faculty of the University of California-Irvine, is the lead author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Providing the proof&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, when it actually is diagnosed, is based on symptoms — exhaustion, sensitivity to light and unexplained pain, among other things — and it comes only after other disease possibilities have been eliminated. It is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis and designated by the acronym ME/CFS. It’s estimated that 2 million people in the United States have chronic fatigue syndrome, but that’s a rough guess, Davis said, and it’s likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Davis, the quest to find scientific evidence of the malady is personal. It comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2016spring/the-puzzle-solver.html&quot;&gt;a desire to help his son&lt;/a&gt;, who has suffered from ME/CFS for about a decade. In fact, it was a biological clue that Davis first spotted in his son that led him and Esfandyarpour to develop the new diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;xlarge&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly see a difference in the way healthy and chronic fatigue syndrome immune cells process stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach, of which Esfandyarpour led the development, employs a “nanoelectronic assay,” which is a test that measures changes in miniscule amounts of energy as a proxy for the health of immune cells and blood plasma. The diagnostic technology contains thousands of electrodes that create an electrical current, as well as chambers to hold simplified blood samples composed of immune cells and plasma. Inside the chambers, the immune cells and plasma interfere with the current, changing its flow from one end to another. The change in electrical activity is directly correlated with the health of the sample. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to stress the samples from both healthy and ill patients using salt, and then compare how each sample affects the flow of the electrical current. Changes in the current indicate changes in the cell: the bigger the change in current, the bigger the change on a cellular level. A big change is not a good thing; it’s a sign that the cells and plasma are flailing under stress and incapable of processing it properly. All of the blood samples from ME/CFS patients created a clear spike in the test, whereas those from healthy controls returned data that was on a relatively even keel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know exactly why the cells and plasma are acting this way, or even what they’re doing,” Davis said. “But there is scientific evidence that this disease is not a fabrication of a patient’s mind. We clearly see a difference in the way healthy and chronic fatigue syndrome immune cells process stress.” Now, Esfandyarpour and Davis are expanding their work to confirm the findings in a larger cohort of participants. Recruitment for the larger project, which aims to further confirm the success of the diagnostic test, is being done on a rolling basis. Those who are interested in participating should contact clinical research coordinator &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:aokumu@stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Anna Okumu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doubling up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnosing ME/CFS, the researchers are also harnessing the platform to screen for drug-based treatments, since currently the options are slim. “Using the nanoelectronics assay, we can add controlled doses of many different potentially therapeutic drugs to the patient’s blood samples and run the diagnostic test again,” Esfandyarpour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the blood samples taken from those with ME/CFS still respond poorly to stress and generate a spike in electrical current, then the drug likely didn’t work. If, however, a drug seems to mitigate the jump in electrical activity, that could mean it is helping the immune cells and plasma better process stress. So far, the team has already found a candidate drug that seems to restore healthy function to immune cells and plasma when tested in the assay. The drug, while successful in the assay, is not currently being used in people with ME/CFS, but Davis and Esfandyarpour are hopeful that they can test their finding in a clinical trial in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the drugs being tested are either already approved by the Food and Drug Administration or will soon be broadly accessible to the public, which is key to fast access and dissemination should any of these compounds pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis is a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://biox.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford Bio-X&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html&quot;&gt;Stanford Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/chri.html&quot;&gt;Stanford Maternal &amp;amp; Child Health Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Stanford authors of the study are research scientists Mohsen Nemat-Gorgani and Julie Wilhelmy and research assistant, Alex Kashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Open Medicine Foundation. Davis is the director of the foundation’s scientific advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford’s departments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://genetics.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=&quot;http://biochemistry.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/a&gt; also supported the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Strategies, Tips, and Tricks for Anki</title>
<link>https://senrigan.io/blog/everything-i-know-strategies-tips-and-tricks-for-spaced-repetition-anki</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://senrigan.io/blog/everything-i-know-strategies-tips-and-tricks-for-spaced-repetition-anki</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, Anki has acted as my digital storage (albeit, imperfect). If I look something up in StackOverflow, I'll add it to Anki. Wikipedia? Another Anki card. It's probably the one thing I most attribute to helping my software engineering career. My total deck recently passed ten thousand cards. In this guide, I'll explain the avoidable (dumb) mistakes, but also provide the effective strategies I found along the way. This Anki guide assumes the reader is familiar with these topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to add cards to Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki decks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an introduction to Spaced Repetition and Anki, please read this earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;article. How Anki Saved My Programming Career&lt;/a&gt;. While I focus on Anki a bit, principles from this guide also apply to SuperMemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Updated: &lt;strong&gt;5/04/2019&lt;/strong&gt;. I will continuously update this from feedback and suggestions. If any bullet points need elaboration, please let me know. A lot was shortened for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beginner's Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Anki beginners, habit &amp;amp; friction is your enemy. Maintaining a daily routine is critical. Read the Beginner's Section below and visit after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;you've maintained Anki for 21 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have more than a hundred cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying beginners to stop reading this guide ... just the rest can be a little overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Anki beginners quit. You'll only keep a Anki routine if you quickly see benefits. Focus on adding work or study related cards for an immediate benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a computer to add cards to Anki. It is hard to add cards on mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning, try not to add more than twenty cards a day. It's very easy to desire to &quot;remember everything&quot; and find yourself overwhelmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add simple cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewing Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download (and review using) the mobile apps. This is probably the most important tip.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Android (free) version is amazing! There is also a iOS version ($25).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a daily habit to review all your cards. In the beginning, reviewing take two to four minutes. It's easy to skip and then catch up, but having a routine will be critical later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to make reviewing Anki as easy as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Card Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki comes with three default card types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Categories and Recommended Card Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;269&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommend Card Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;General&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic + Reversed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avoid tip-of-the-tongue issues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Screenshots from Video Tutorials (YouTube, etc)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It's hard to format screenshots to fit front-and-back or cloze formats.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Code Block (Snippet)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic, Use Anki Code Plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most code snippets are hard to format.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Code Block (StackOverflow Answer)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic, Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most code snippets are hard to format to fit basic-and-reversed. I frequently will just take a snapshot of the answer and paste unformatted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definitions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic-and-reversed can have multiple answers. Easier to make a basic card. Definitions in cloze can let the answer slip too easily.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wikipedia Paragraph&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wikipedia articles are a great way to provide context while quizzing you on key topics. Improves fundamentals.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Labelled Images (Human Body, Anatomy, Maps, etc)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Image Occlusion Plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Your brain was designed for visual memory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;List&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lists are difficult to memorize on basic. Cloze cards separates a list into multiple cards.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding Basic type cards. If you can make a basic card, you can probably make it a Basic + Reversed (BR) Card. BR Cards help avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;tip of the tongue phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/2chYgJqOSXaEbkjegN0U&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;729&quot; height=&quot;182&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For definitions (example: provenance), the basic+reversed type isn't helpful. I want to know a word's meaning, but trying to recall something that means &quot;origin&quot; has too many answers (immemorial, provenance, inception, etc). &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/6PYo8PKRdqFHXDuhLumQ&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;242&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloze cards are great for adding context to understand a topic. Most basic+reversed cards can be made into cloze cards. Over time my preferences have gone from Basic —&amp;gt; Basic + Reversed —&amp;gt; Cloze.&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/4MMKadx8T9eYixCmrWQV&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1237&quot; height=&quot;139&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adding Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each question should have a single succinct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Uc0JeNSnT5ykvrhAC4FK&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention. &lt;strong&gt;THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IF POSSIBLE, USE A VISUAL CUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/MG5zRFudQK6l9DWAyUEz&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;837&quot; height=&quot;521&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't add things you don't understand. Otherwise, expect frustration. The same card will be wrong multiple days, marked as a leech and a waste of time. [See Antipatterns, Useful Links]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of your Anki cards should be as simple as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add additional context for hard questions. If you get a card wrong, it's helpful to know more about the topic. I prefer adding in the extra info with cloze cards. For basic or basic + reversed cards, I'll have a succinct answer on Line 1, line breaks, Lines 3+ will be additional information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/lsE5yRuET0GOftafLx2m&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a card with multiple answers, add hints (HINT: Begins with a P...). When adding, you won't realize a question has multiple answers, but when you're reviewing, you'll know. Try to avoid this and write better questions with single answers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Gk8XaK75QR2yWVgwi77C&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1134&quot; height=&quot;155&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't Add Cards Memorizing Entire Lists. Too easily forgotten. You might remember Points 1, 2, 4 today and tomorrow only remember Points 1, 2, 3.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If necessary, use a cloze to memorize lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists can be memorized using the loci method. [See: Learning Strategies]&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/15dguZUQTRFMufUHgj8w&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I added the above into a single &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;basic&lt;/span&gt; card — &lt;em&gt;Q: &quot;What are the dates and milestones of Deep Learning Ideas?&quot; A:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;6&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long forgettable list&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; A cloze is a better approach. I can get one or two facts wrong without having to redo the card.&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Sk0br5OkQDiKRPi3dIeO&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid importing online Anki decks. Similar to note taking, your own materials have better retention and comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When studying offline material, don't simultaneously create cards. Instead, highlight/circle the topics, write the Anki question you would have asked and finish studying. After the study session (or tomorrow) review your circled questions and add it to Anki. This is referred as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes&quot;&gt;Cornell Notes system&lt;/a&gt;. [See: Studying and Learning]
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding cards when offline studying is risky, it's too easy to end in a Wikipedia rabbit hole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've added cards, sync Anki (keyboard shortcut: Y) before leaving your house or office. Review during commute. &lt;strong&gt;Make this a habit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When watching online videos/lectures, I frequently create Basic cards and use screenshots as answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/dWoyxgCS5iDuweAlELbH&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;857&quot; height=&quot;583&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For sites that have a detailed explanation (StackOverflow answers), I also use a screenshot instead of dealing with formatting. I'm lazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tradeoff of screenshots is they can't be easily searched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you forget an Anki card (that you've already added and should know) add a similar question worded slightly differently. Spaced repetition isn't perfect, so asking the same question in a different way helps drill an answer.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another alternative is to add an Anki card asking &quot;what term did you forget about when you were talking to [person]?&quot;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/4s5Pciq5TqmPdxaNEs07&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't care about grammar, formatting or spelling (apologies about some card examples ...). You shouldn't either. Only you review your cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include where you learned it. Helps links back visually. Human brains are weird. Personalizing a card helps recall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/YrdARDQ5SYWXVh5obE3r&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height=&quot;508&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're going to paste a paragraph that uses a cloze term multiple times, use a find and replace (I like using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt; to do this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add names to faces. Thoughtful teachers add an entire class of student faces to names prior to the first day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer cards in random order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add-Ons / Plugins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKUP YOUR ANKI DECK BEFORE INSTALLING ADD-ONS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complete Anki add-ons list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Normally sorting by ratings is a reasonable heuristic (sorting is currently broken). Avoid add-ons that are less than a year old; there are stories about add-ons accidentally deleting cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all add-ons play nicely with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uninstall an add-on if you don't intend to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously, back up your deck first&lt;/strong&gt;. I normally review the source code before installing any add-ons. Many have dubious code quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Night Mode&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes it really really easy to highlight syntax code. I use an earlier version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it much easier to add cards related to Coding Snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Power Format Pack&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like Syntax Highlighter for ease-of-use, but this another common way to format your Anki cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Image Occlusion&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorize shortcuts to add Anki cards faster. Meta-Anki: Use Anki to memorize Anki shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don't have Windows examples, but similar strategies apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortcuts Example : How To Quickly Add An Anki Card on Mac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alt + Tab to Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit A to enable Add A Card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the card front&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the card back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift + Enter to enter the card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esc to main screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt + Tab to go back to what I was working on.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Add A Card Prompt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Add A Card&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shift + Enter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Close&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Esc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Create A Cloze Card&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + Shift + C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Select Card Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Change Deck Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use keyboard keys. 1 (Again), 2 (Hard), 3 (Good), or 4 (Easy). Easier than using mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/5I3kn2lTZKgwZq2TXalv&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitting Spacebar defaults to Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Tips and Tricks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer reviewing on Mobile. Since I normally review during my commute, mobile is imperative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable App Gestures.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set Swipe Left to &lt;strong&gt;Answer button 1&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Again / Fail&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Swipe Right to &lt;strong&gt;Answer button 2&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Hard&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make all the taps to &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Show answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/gAjwE2G9RNDOtcF2v8Gc&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;551&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it really useful on the train / bus since you can review Anki with one hand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;s1qo48hh-0 bThxNZ&quot; readability=&quot;11.826086956522&quot;&gt;Credit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/biyjtc/everything_i_know_a_comprehensive_guide_of/em51feo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minh0&lt;/a&gt;: Brought up a valid criticism about Swipe difficulty.  While my default Swipe Right - Correct is &quot;Answer Button 2&quot;, which means Hard. Some users (especially those with large medical Anki cards) may prefer to have it to be &quot;Answer Button 3&quot; which means Good. Otherwise, the amount of cards to review doesn't decrease fast enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DGcWpr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;phone ring&lt;/a&gt;. You can now swipe left and right on one hand easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make It A Favorite / Docked App for Easier Access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Autosyncing. The app will now sync when you open or when you've finished a deck (per 30 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Nightmode. Both the Android and iOS app have this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have more than fifteen minutes of Anki, turn on airplane mode first. Your phone/tablet's notifications were made to distract you. Turn back on after reviewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;General &lt;strong&gt;Reviewing Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer using mobile (Phone / Tablet) to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have time, think about where you learned the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you're finished a deck, you have the option to review any forgotten cards in the last X days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/riqCXd3IQheiyZcrc2Fl&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;309&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review forgotten cards in decks that you're willing to overstudy and improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing forgotten cards is a great way to use mnemonics and visual imagery to remember. Because visual imagery takes a bit longer to think about, I save it for cards that I'm forgetting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing forgotten is useful when you've finished reviewing and want to burn some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on your deck, try not to reviewing forgotten cards too many days back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a reasonable amount of Anki cards and you're committed to Anki — I recommend buying an android tablet. It makes reviewing easier. I know this is ridiculous. A tablet has a few benefits over your phone:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger reading space. The 8'' is a perfect tablet size to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer the Android App over iOS. I've tried Anki on a Samsung and Apple tablet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tablets have less distractions than your phone. (Less calls, texts and emails).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a review, you might find something wrong with a card. If it's not easily fixable, star it. Don't edit it now, finish your review session and batch fix incorrect starred cards later. On a weekend, you can open up Anki via desktop and select &quot;All Starred Cards&quot; and make edits.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you'll forget why you starred a card for an error. I will write a little note next to the card what's missing (cloze, formatting, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it's the last card in a Deck, and you've gotten it wrong a few times, be careful. You're likely think you remembered it because of the recency. I recommend slowly reviewing or making an extensive mental image of the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Spacebar to go to the next card. [See: Shortcuts]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Night Mode Add-On. Your eyes thank me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use learning strategies. [Learning and Study Methods]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Time for Anki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dead Time is Anki Time
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to go on Reddit, HackerNews, social media, etc. finish your Anki deck first. Or at the very least, try to do five cards. Use Anki as a source to procrastinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends are frequently late. I do Anki when waiting. If they're really late, I'll start a review forgotten session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Times To Do Anki:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-productive meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting in line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twenty minutes of movie trailers before a movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having trouble with Anki, I recommend printing out a calendar, putting it on your fridge and writing an X everyday if you attempted 10 minutes. Don't make the goal to finish your entire deck, but just that you spent 10 minutes. Having low expectations of a task is a great way to avoid anxiety and just start. Known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seinfeld Method / Don't Break the Chain&lt;/a&gt;. Habit Tracker is another app that is great for tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking yourself in a room without WiFi is another sadistic, but effective method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm frequently pulled into non-productive meetings (classic engineer gripe). I'll just do Anki on my laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your commute style. I found myself preferring a bus over a train that added fifteen minutes to my commute. The bus gave me a seat and uninterrupted time to review. On the other hand, New York trains were too chaotic to get into a good rhythm to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find Anki + Tablet + Notebook + Good Food at a Restaurant is a really enjoyable way to review. I'll normally write down any answers I get wrong into the notebook, ponder about why I got them wrong and enjoy some really good food. Since I'll normally go to the same restaurant, I always end up being friends with the restaurant stuff. This tactic is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/too-lazy-to-work-out-try-temptation-bundling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;temptation bundling&lt;/a&gt;, combining something really good (food) with something that's work (reviewing). The making friends is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deck Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The community advice is to have all your cards merged in one deck. This has two main benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It reduces the Anki context problem - this happens when you can only remember the answer from an Anki app, but not in real-world situations. Similar to below. This is also referred to as interleaving&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/khmYKSTTRwaRRe1aUfOE&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It boosts creativity. Having two completely unrelated cards helps think about problems in different ways. Quizzing about tornados and binary-tree algorithms makes me visit the problem in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That being said, I have multiple decks. There are some benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very useful for new jobs: Have a new job deck and add all your work related cards in there. Review it at a much higher frequency (+ use review forgotten). Your learning rate and the speed of recall will improve.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can accelerate learning on a particular topic if I make a custom deck for it. Spaced repetition algorithms maximize efficiency of memory, sometimes I don't care about efficiency and want to brute-force improve at underlying material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm debating trying a new topic (math, music, etc), I will add that material to a new deck. That way if I decide I hate this topic, I can delete/avoid the entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much easier to avoid decks you don't have enough time to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can listen to different types of music depending on decks. For easy decks I listen to pop music. Harder decks require music with a slower cadence. My &quot;definitions&quot; deck is a relatively easy deck; I listen to fun music there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm learning one new topic, I will throw everything into the default deck. If I'm learning two different topics, I will have two different decks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, at 20-25 decks it gets a bit messy. Probably merge some at that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of deck decisions are based on your learning and studying habits. It's trivially easy to combine everything into one deck later, the inverse isn't true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of my deck strategies can be done similarly via tags. Personally, tags weren't really as useful as decks. They required more time to make, and the way to review specific tags required too much customization. I also felt that the mobile apps weren't really good for tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person varies. If you find yourself using a tagging system in Evernote, OneNote, etc. then you may want to approach Anki with tags. If you don't (myself personally), then tags probably won't work for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some useful advice by redditor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/biocuk/everything_i_know_a_comprehensive_guide_of/em2b3cd?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cubicpillow about the benefits of tags vs. decks&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don't review by tags but I use them to keep my cards organized. Tags have the advantage of being able to have multiple tags (i.e. I might have a card with the tags music theory, banjo, banjo exercise).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I do like to keep as many cards in one deck as possible, but I'll break out separate decks if I require a specific tool or setting to review them. BJJ cards are best reviewed with a training partner to drill with. Banjo cards require a banjo. Slight of hand cards require props, Spanish cards are better with sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning &amp;amp; Study Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I cannot create, I do not understand. — Richard Feynman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people use Anki as a way to amplify memory. I use Anki for memory AND to fundamentally learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use multimodal study strategies. Using different modes of learning can enforce an idea.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the answer out loud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it out. For wrong answers, I'll write it on paper. The act of writing is meditative. I really enjoy this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study in a different location than normal (different coffee shops, public locations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize the answer (see below).
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many others. The point is changing your study patterns helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning: To become world-class, you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt;. That requires expertise in fundamentals.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This strategy only applies to topics you want long-term mastery. I only use this for a subset. Be picky. It's impossible to apply first principles thinking to your entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm trying to learn from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt;, I'll write and draw mind maps &amp;amp; diagrams. This takes considerably more time to review, but makes similar concepts easier to grok. Mindmaps are a great way to stabilize topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping on asking yourself why? why does this work? why does it work this way? Force yourself to understand the root of a topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cornell Method&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When reading a topic, write out questions on the margins to quiz yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend You Have to Teach It
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Works incredibly well. Help realize knowledge gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend you have to explain it to a five year old for extra difficulty. Only allow yourself to use basic vocabulary and concepts. If you can't explain it simply, then you don't really know it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Exquisite Visual Imagery
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you make very intense mental visual images, you'll remember it for life. he visual image doesn't have to make sense (most of my don't). &lt;em&gt;Q: What's the capital of Romania? A: Bucharest.&lt;/em&gt; I have a disturbing image of Romans being conquerors and butchering an innocent village at rest. butcher-at-rest, butch-at-rest, Bucharest. I know this sounds very silly, but visual imagery really works. Don't worry, you won't fool yourself into thinking Romania are Romans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mnemonics phrases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pemdas-definition-rule-examples.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PEMDAS&lt;/a&gt; for lists and other hard-to-remember topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't know an answer, try to force yourself to reason what the answer could be.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow and hard, but very useful in first principle thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Memory Palace&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Loci Method&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think about the room you grew up. Weird how you can still remember ... Now put an Anki term interacting with an object from the room. &lt;strong&gt;Visualize the term really hard&lt;/strong&gt;. When you wake up tomorrow, you'll still remember the term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is useful for memorizing extensive lists. I will go counter-clockwise in a room and make every item in a list interact with something from my childhood bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studying Before Bedtime
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Useful for reviewing forgotten cards. I don't recommend trying to do your daily review session at night though, it's too easy to fall asleep and be backlogged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful if you suffering from insomnia and want to get your mind on something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend the word makes a sound describing something else. Q: 'How do I use Python's DictWriter to output a line?' A: writer.writerow(). I like to make this stupid sound of &quot;ruh row&quot;, like a sad &quot;oh no!&quot;. It works. This example is so embarrassing and ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a checklist of first principles reasoning and meta-learning tactics when reviewing Anki. I'll write about it sometime later, but it didn't fit in this guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Deleting Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get over your gripe about deleting cards. If you find yourself forgetting a crappy card or just never want to see the card again, delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delete Cards That Don't Make Sense
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can't fix it with a batched star (and edit later), delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having issues with a particular card for multiple days, it may be a poorly written card. Delete and write it in a clear way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Bad Programming Languages You Don't Use
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After a few years, I can safely say I won't need PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Things You Don't Want To Remember Anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't feel bad that you studied a card months ago and forgot it. It happens. If you no longer care for the card, delete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're still too scared to delete, you can also suspend cards to edit later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with Spaced Repetition Burnout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is when you feel overwhelmed and don't want to review cards. It frequently happens when you've added too many cards quickly. You've missed a few review sessions and now have a couple of hundred cards to review. Or you have too many cards you don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a way to just start: Leave your location and commit to one &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; (25 minutes) of Anki at your favorite coffee shop. Turn on airplane mode. Jam to your favorite music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're feeling overwhelmed, go out for a ten minute walk. Then when you come back, if you still don't want to do your daily Anki, don't. The mental agreement helps me start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable with deleting cards that cause you frustration. [See: Deleting Cards]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, only review a deck you're passionate about until you can get back into a daily rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid burnout:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding too many cards too quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't fall too far behind on Anki reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding too many cards that you don't fully understand. Too many difficult cards causes frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable deleting / suspending frustrating cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't try to trick yourself w/quirky questions. You may think you can ask a question in a misleading way to trick yourself will make you remember the topic better, but it just trips me in the long-run.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Normal Example — &lt;em&gt;Q: Programming: How do I &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; and add all messages and files? A: git commit -am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tricky Example — &lt;em&gt;Q: Programming: How do I &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; and add all messages and files? A: git commit -am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem now is your brain remembers the word &quot;&lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and the next time you think of &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;, your brain goes &quot;wait, did you use &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; as trick term or was it &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;? ARGH&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't keep forgetful cards even if you've spent time trying to remember (sunk cost fallacy). You'll find certain cards you remember for a few months and then inevitably forget. Some cards aren't worth it. Delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't turn on the Auto Next Card feature. Way too easy to mess up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't explain Anki to a newcomer by showing the first card of your deck. Luck says it will always be of something embarrassing you read from an article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different types of music will subtly change your review speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EDM/POP Music? I KNOW EVERYTHING TODAY. I then review cards a little too quickly ... the euphoria makes me overconfident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical Music? Slows me down, makes me more thoughtful. Not as fun tho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Community Tips from Reddit and Other Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I use Anki to memorize vocabulary as well. So what I do instead of asking What word means {{Definition}}, I use colons to introduce a definition like : {{Definition}}. That way I could add two or three meanings, which also helps to differentiate words that have similar definitions. Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/plain_tshirt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plain_tshirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Antipatterns / Applicable Only To Odd People Like Myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I frequently add entire Wikipedia descriptions as cloze cards (about a topic I don't understand yet). Because I also use Anki as my learning pad, I know I'll sit down and study this knowledge. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/syrlcPZgRlegnY0IEj51&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;815&quot; height=&quot;198&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point, it's trivially easy and intoxicating to add facts from articles. Previously, if the Wall Street Journal mentioned a person's background and alma matter, I added it. This was useless. Add knowledge if helpful; if not, it's probably not worth knowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having trouble with remembering cards (my brain ignores certain topics), delete them. Spaced repetition isn't about spaced torture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useless Things I Don't Add Anymore
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Birthdates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw Numbers. Like 2016 United States GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politician Names / Faces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop Culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Misc:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Explaining Anki — From time to time, people will ask random sorcery is Anki. It's hard to explain verbally spaced repetition, but drawing out the memory curve is effective for the person to get the &quot;aha&quot; moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/7m31dpYBQyu3z6ueXhFG&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sync Conflicts. If you get a sync conflict like the below ... pick the source that has the most cards. You might have to repeat a daily review, but it's better than losing cards you created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/6qzXj0qcTLW5gKctTM8Q&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes I'm a lazy buffoon. I tried adding motivational techniques in Anki, but that doesn't help. Q: How should you get out of bed when you don't feel like it? A: Use a five second rule. Five, four, three AND THEN GET OUT OF BED. Result? I remembered the five second rule and continued snoozing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategies I've Been Meaning To Try (But Haven't)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these aren't hard truths. Your brain is different (and probably smarter) than mine. You'll devise your own strategies based on how you study and learn. Visual imagery though - that tip is GOLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Articles Per Request&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta-Learning — First Principles and Foundations Checklist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll be releasing a program that correlates Sleep, Nutrition, and Supplements on Anki and memory in the two months. I'm a quantified-self fan.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>OpenAI releases larger GPT-2 model</title>
<link>https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#update</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#update</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;js-excerpt&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization—all without task-specific training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;btns&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-padded icon-code&quot;&gt;View code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-padded icon-paper&quot;&gt;Read paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model, called GPT-2 (a successor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/&quot;&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt;), was trained simply to predict the next word in 40GB of Internet text. Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model. As an experiment in responsible disclosure, we are instead releasing a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot;&gt;smaller model&lt;/a&gt; for researchers to experiment with, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf&quot;&gt;technical paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 is a large &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&quot;&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt;-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation. In addition, GPT-2 outperforms other language models trained on specific domains (like Wikipedia, news, or books) without needing to use these domain-specific training datasets. On language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these tasks from the raw text, using no task-specific training data. While scores on these downstream tasks are far from state-of-the-art, they suggest that the tasks can benefit from unsupervised techniques, given sufficient (unlabeled) data and compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;Samples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 generates synthetic text samples in response to the model being primed with an arbitrary input. The model is chameleon-like—it adapts to the style and content of the conditioning text. This allows the user to generate realistic and coherent continuations about a topic of their choosing, as seen by the following select samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;gpt-2-heading small-caps mt-lg-0.125&quot;&gt;System Prompt (human-written)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gpt-2-section&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;gpt-2-heading small-caps mt-lg-0.125&quot;&gt;Model Completion (machine-written, 10 tries)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A train carriage containing controlled nuclear materials was stolen in Cincinnati today. Its whereabouts are unknown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;gpt-2-heading small-caps mt-lg-0.125&quot;&gt;Model Completion (machine-written, first try)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The incident occurred on the downtown train line, which runs from Covington and Ashland stations.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;In an email to Ohio news outlets, the U.S. Department of Energy said it is working with the Federal Railroad Administration to find the thief.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“The theft of this nuclear material will have significant negative consequences on public and environmental health, our workforce and the economy of our nation,” said Tom Hicks, the U.S. Energy Secretary, in a statement. “Our top priority is to secure the theft and ensure it doesn’t happen again.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve trained a large language model called GPT-2 that generates realistic paragraphs of text, while also exhibiting zero shot generalization on tasks like machine translation, question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization - problems usually approached by using training datasets and models designed explicitly for these tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical approach to language modeling is to learn the following task: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. Last year, OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) showed that language models trained on large amounts of data can be fine-tuned to specific tasks to achieve high performance. GPT-2 shows that much larger language models trained on a more diverse dataset derived from the internet begin to learn these NLP tasks without needing task-specific training data, instead learning from examples the system derives from the raw text. These systems also display a substantial qualitative jump in the realism and coherence of generated text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We are now preparing a collection of datasets for translation and machine translation in our language model. We will be using one of the large number of text samples provided by The New York Times.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We believe this project is the first step in the direction of developing large NLP systems without task-specific training data. That is, we are developing a machine language system in the generative style with no explicit rules for producing text.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We hope for future collaborations between computer scientists, linguists, and machine learning researchers.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The orcs’ response was a deafening onslaught of claws, claws, and claws; even Elrond was forced to retreat. “You are in good hands, dwarf,” said Gimli, who had been among the first to charge at the orcs; it took only two words before their opponents were reduced to a blood-soaked quagmire, and the dwarf took his first kill of the night. The battle lasted for hours until two of the largest Orcs attempted to overwhelm Aragorn. When they finally stopped, they lay defeated and lifeless for miles and miles.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I take nothing,” said Aragorn. “But I give my word, at my peril and mine, that I will never forget this day of horror. None of us will forget. Ever!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I’ll never forget it!” cried Gimli, who had been in the thick of the battle but hadn’t taken part in it. One of the wounded orcs he had carried off, he was the only one of the survivors who remained uninjured. “We’ll keep the memory of that day of evil, and the war with it, alive as long as we live, my friends!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“Then we’ll keep it alive as long as we live,” added Legolas. “And we won’t forget the first great battle of the night, even if we may have forgotten the final defeat.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I agree,” Gandalf said, “but we will all remember it as the last battle in Middle-earth, and the first great battle of the new day.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Aragorn drew his sword, and the Battle of Fangorn was won. As they marched out through the thicket the morning mist cleared, and the day turned to dusk.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The Two Rings were returned to Rivendell. Frodo and Sam woke up alone in their room, and Frodo found a note on his pillow. He opened it and read:&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;May the Power of the Ring be with you always, and may its light never fade. I am not sure if it matters which of the two rings we accept this day but, as you asked me, I have chosen mine. I am sorry to leave you, Frodo, but know that we are very close to the end, and that you are with us forever. May this letter find you safely in Rivendell; and if it does not, then I will accept the ring in your stead. If by any chance you find or give this letter to the enemy, may they learn the strength of the ring and may the Two Rings never be broken!&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;By Donny Ferguson&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But that's not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. You're not wrong about that, but it's kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states' rights and federalism. So let's try again. What's the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;In 1791, Thomas Jefferson said &quot;Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&quot; The &quot;founding fathers&quot; were basically religious men who were not very concerned with states' rights. The Civil War occurred in reaction to the idea that the federal government was taking far too much power away from the states, that they weren't sovereign. Jefferson himself, as you well know, is an author of the Declaration of Independence who had some really crazy ideas about, well, you know, secession for a variety of reasons. The War Between the States (later the Great Rebellion) was a radical re-imagining of the American idea and not surprisingly, Jefferson's grandson, who took after both his father and his grandfather and wrote about it, was named Thomas, after the president. &quot;The federal and state governments are both contrived for the benefit of the rich and large property,&quot; This view of the Founding Fathers has been promoted by some of today's most prominent politicians, including some who hold prominent national offices and have a direct stake in a Republican Party that has been hijacked by the &quot;federalist&quot; wing of the party. So why is it that so many people have an easy-to-spot way of understanding the Civil War that has everything to do with the South and nothing to do with the South? The Confederate flag has been a symbol of racism for a long time, but when the Civil War started and the Civil War ended, many people suddenly began to see it differently. There was a change of heart, which I think is what led people to take the question of why the Civil War happened quite seriously.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The other part of the explanation is what one scholar I think gets at well and a lot of people don't is this idea that the Southern states were being left behind in the Industrial Revolution and this made the South really feel, especially in the South, that they weren't really in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John F. Kennedy was just elected President of the United States after rising from the grave decades after his assassination. Due to miraculous developments in nanotechnology, Kennedy's brain was rebuilt from his remains and installed in the control center of a state-of-the art humanoid robot. Below is a transcript of his acceptance speech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;It is time once again. I believe this nation can do great things if the people make their voices heard. The men and women of America must once more summon our best elements, all our ingenuity, and find a way to turn such overwhelming tragedy into the opportunity for a greater good and the fulfillment of all our dreams. In the months and years to come, there will be many battles in which we will have to be strong and we must give all of our energy, not to repel invaders, but rather to resist aggression and to win the freedom and the equality for all of our people. The destiny of the human race hangs in the balance; we cannot afford for it to slip away. Now and in the years to come, the challenge before us is to work out how we achieve our ultimate destiny. If we fail to do so, we are doomed.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;We, the descendants of the men and women of the Continental Army, who faced down a superior force on behalf of our independence and who fought against the evil powers of the world for the sake of freedom and human dignity, we, the heirs of men and women like Daniel Boone whom this country has produced, can accomplish our destiny as well as you have accomplished yours; and we pledge ourselves before the entire world, every second of every day.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;After the election, the President of the United States asked for a &quot;more complete&quot; body of information on Kennedy's brains' origin. In an e-mail exchange with me, Dr. Robert Wood, who, according to Wikipedia is the head of the University of Maryland Advanced Nanotechnology Research project, provided the following information:&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;(1) The brain of JFK was harvested and reconstructed via tissue sampling. There was no way that the tissue could be transported by air. (2) A sample was collected from the area around his upper chest and sent to the University of Maryland for analysis. A human brain at that point would be about one and a half cubic centimeters. The data were then analyzed along with material that was obtained from the original brain to produce a reconstruction; in layman's terms, a &quot;mesh&quot; of brain tissue. There were no additional funds from the Department of Defense involved. The samples were sent back to the FBI lab for review and analysis. (3) There was never an attempt to clone any of America's greatest presidents. As far as we knew, the President was one of the most famous people on planet earth. If it had been possible, it would have.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Recycling is NOT good for the world. It is bad for the environment, it is bad for our health, and it is bad for our economy. I'm not kidding. Recycling is not good for the environment. It is destructive to the earth and it is a major contributor to global warming. Recycling is not good for our health. It contributes to obesity and diseases like heart disease and cancer. Recycling is bad for our economy. It increases the cost of a product, and in turn, the price of everything that is made with that product. Recycling is not good for our nation. We pay a tremendous price for the privilege of having the world's most advanced and efficient recycling system. Recycling is a huge, colossal waste of time, energy, money, and resources. And THAT is why we need to get back to basics and get back to basics in our recycling efforts. One of the best ways to start is to look at the process of creating a paper product. When you make a paper product, it is basically a long chain of materials. Everything from the raw materials (wood, cardboard, paper, etc.), to the reagents (dyes, solvents, etc.) to the printing equipment (chemicals, glue, paper, ink, etc.), to the packaging, to the packaging materials (mercury, chemicals, etc.) to the processing equipment (heating, cooling, etc.), to the packaging materials, to the packaging materials that are shipped overseas and to the packaging materials that are used in the United States. Each step along the way creates tons of waste that we constantly have to clean up. The process of making a paper product is a very wasteful one. But the end result is something that all of us need to consume. And if we want to keep the recycling process running efficiently, then we really need to think about each and every step that goes into making a paper product.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the above samples show, our model is capable of generating samples from a variety of prompts that feel close to human quality and show coherence over a page or more of text. Nevertheless, we have observed various failure modes, such as repetitive text, world modeling failures (e.g. the model sometimes writes about &lt;em&gt;fires happening under water&lt;/em&gt;), and unnatural topic switching. Exploring these types of weaknesses of language models is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811&quot;&gt;active&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03055&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03185&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the natural language processing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we find that it takes a few tries to get a good sample, with the number of tries depending on how familiar the model is with the context. When prompted with topics that are highly represented in the data (Brexit, Miley Cyrus, Lord of the Rings, and so on), it seems to be capable of generating reasonable samples about 50% of the time. The opposite is also true: on highly technical or esoteric types of content, the model can perform poorly. Fine-tuning offers the potential for even more detailed control over generated samples—for example, we can fine-tune GPT-2 on the Amazon Reviews dataset and use this to let us write reviews conditioned on things like star rating and category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These samples have substantial policy implications: large language models are becoming increasingly easy to steer towards scalable, customized, coherent text generation, which in turn could be used in a number of beneficial as well as malicious ways. We'll discuss these implications below in more detail, and outline a publication experiment we are taking in light of such considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zeroshot&quot;&gt;Zero-shot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 achieves state-of-the-art scores on a variety of domain-specific language modeling tasks. Our model is not trained on any of the data specific to any of these tasks and is only evaluated on them as a final test; this is known as the &quot;zero-shot&quot; setting. GPT-2 outperforms models trained on domain-specific datasets (e.g. Wikipedia, news, books) when evaluated on those same datasets. The following table shows all our state-of-the-art zero-shot results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(+) means a higher score is better for this domain. (-) means a lower score is better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, we are able to get surprising results without any fine-tuning of our models, simply by prompting the trained model in the right way (see below for examples of how we do this), though we do still fall short of state-of-the-art for specialized systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay was run from March 24 until August 8, 2008, prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the theme of &quot;one world, one dream&quot;. Plans for the relay were announced on April 26, 2007, in Beijing, China. The relay, also called by the organizers as the &quot;Journey of Harmony&quot;, lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi) – the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch traveled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch was following a route passing through six continents. The torch has visited cities along the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. The relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China from the Chinese side, which was closed specially for the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the theme?&lt;br/&gt;A: &quot;one world, one dream&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the length of the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: 137,000 km&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Was it larger than previous ones?&lt;br/&gt;A: No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did the race begin?&lt;br/&gt;A: Olympia, Greece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Is there anything notable about that place?&lt;br/&gt;A: birthplace of Olympic Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did they go after?&lt;br/&gt;A: Athens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How many days was the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Did they visit any notable landmarks?&lt;br/&gt;A: Panathinaiko Stadium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that since these tasks are a subset of general language modeling, we can expect performance to increase further with more compute and data. Others have published &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11373&quot;&gt;similar hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;. We also expect fine-tuning to help performance on downstream tasks, though we have yet to do thorough experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;policyimplications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large, general language models could have significant societal impacts, and also have many near-term applications. We can anticipate how systems like GPT-2 could be used to create:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI writing assistants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More capable dialogue agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupervised translation between languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better speech recognition systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also imagine the application of these models for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/preparing-for-malicious-uses-of-ai/&quot;&gt;malicious purposes&lt;/a&gt;, including the following (or other applications we can't yet anticipate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate misleading news articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonate others online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of spam/phishing content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery, audio, and video, imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content and waging disinformation campaigns. The public at large will need to become more skeptical of text they find online, just as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3213954&quot;&gt;deep fakes&lt;/a&gt;&quot; phenomenon calls for more skepticism about images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, malicious actors—some of which are political in nature—have already begun to target the shared online commons, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/the-new-censors-wont-delete-your-words--theyll-drown-them-out/2019/02/08/c8a926a2-2b27-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html&quot;&gt;things like&lt;/a&gt; “robotic tools, fake accounts and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary or smears that make them afraid to speak, or difficult to be heard or believed”. We should consider how research into the generation of synthetic images, videos, audio, and text may further combine to unlock new as-yet-unanticipated capabilities for these actors, and should seek to create better technical and non-technical countermeasures. Furthermore, the underlying technical innovations inherent to these systems are core to fundamental artificial intelligence research, so it is not possible to control research in these domains without slowing down the progress of AI as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;releasestrategy&quot;&gt;Release Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/&quot;&gt;much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code&lt;/a&gt;. We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights. Nearly a year ago we wrote in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Charter&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research,&quot; and we see this current work as potentially representing the early beginnings of such concerns, which we expect may grow over time. This decision, as well as our discussion of it, is an experiment: while we are not sure that it is the right decision today, we believe that the AI community will eventually need to tackle the issue of publication norms in a thoughtful way in certain research areas. Other disciplines such as biotechnology and cybersecurity have long had active debates about responsible publication in cases with clear misuse potential, and we hope that our experiment will serve as a case study for more nuanced discussions of model and code release decisions in the AI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will further publicly discuss this strategy in six months. If you’d like to discuss large language models and their implications, please email us at: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:languagequestions@openai.com&quot;&gt;languagequestions@openai.com&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’re excited about working on cutting-edge language models (and thinking through their policy implications), &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;mb-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;pt-0.5 d-block&quot; id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;GPT-2 Interim Update, May 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're implementing two mechanisms to responsibly publish GPT-2 and hopefully future releases: staged release and partnership-based sharing. We're now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; a larger 345M version of GPT-2 as a next step in staged release, and are sharing the 762M and 1.5B versions with partners in the AI and security communities who are working to improve societal preparedness for large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;stagedrelease&quot;&gt;Staged Release&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staged release involves the gradual release of a family of models over time. The purpose of our staged release of GPT-2 is to give people time to assess the properties of these models, discuss their societal implications, and evaluate the impacts of release after each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the next step in our staged release strategy, we are releasing the 345M parameter version of GPT-2. This model features improved performance relative to the 117M version, though falls short of the 1.5B version with respect to the ease of generating coherent text. We have been excited to see so many positive uses of GPT-2-117M, and hope that 345M will yield still more benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the misuse risk of 345M is higher than that of 117M, we believe it is substantially lower than that of 1.5B, and we believe that training systems of similar capability to GPT-2-345M is well within the reach of many actors already; this evolving replication landscape has informed our decision-making about what is appropriate to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making our 345M release decision, some of the factors we considered include: the ease of use (by various users) of different model sizes for generating coherent text, the role of humans in the text generation process, the likelihood and timing of future replication and publication by others, evidence of use in the wild and expert-informed inferences about unobservable uses, proofs of concept such as the review generator mentioned in the original blog post, the strength of demand for the models for beneficial purposes, and the input of stakeholders and experts. We remain uncertain about some of these variables and continue to welcome input on how to make appropriate language model publication decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that ongoing research on bias, detection, and misuse will give us the confidence to publish larger models in a timely manner, and at the six month mark we will share a fuller analysis of language models’ societal implications and our heuristics for release decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;partnerships&quot;&gt;Partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since releasing this blog post in February, we have had conversations with many external researchers, technology companies, and policymakers about our release strategy and the implications of increasingly large language models. We’ve also presented or discussed our work at events, including a dinner co-hosted with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.partnershiponai.org/when-is-it-appropriate-to-publish-high-stakes-ai-research/&quot;&gt;Partnership on AI&lt;/a&gt; and a presentation to policymakers in Washington DC at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/r/gec/tech/index.htm&quot;&gt;Global Engagement Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently forming research partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, and industry labs focused on increasing societal preparedness for large language models. In particular, we are sharing the 762M and 1.5B parameter versions of GPT-2 to facilitate research on language model output detection, language model bias analysis and mitigation, and analysis of misuse potential. In addition to observing the impacts of language models in the wild, engaging in dialogue with stakeholders, and conducting in-house analysis, these research partnerships will be a key input to our decision-making on larger models. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#talktous&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;outputdataset&quot;&gt;Output Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; a dataset of GPT-2 outputs from all 4 model sizes, with and without top-k truncation, as well as a subset of the WebText corpus used to train GPT-2. The output dataset features approximately 250,000 samples per model/hyperparameter pair, which we expect is sufficient to help a wider range of researchers perform quantitative and qualitative analysis on the three topics above. Alongside these datasets, we are including a baseline analysis of some detection-related properties of the models, which we hope others will be able to quickly build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;talktous&quot;&gt;Talk to Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in collaborating with researchers working on language model output detection, bias, and publication norms, and with organizations potentially affected by large language models: please reach out at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:languagepartners@openai.com&quot;&gt;languagepartners@openai.com&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, OpenAI’s language, safety, and policy teams will be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iclr.cc/&quot;&gt;ICLR&lt;/a&gt; next week, including at the Reproducibility workshop and the OpenAI booth. In particular, we will be discussing this release strategy at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/iclr2019/schedule.htm&quot;&gt;AI for Social Good&lt;/a&gt; workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rose Marie Bentley lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-type=&quot;sourceText&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ImageCaptionWrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Spaced Repetition</title>
<link>https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When should one review? In the morning? In the evening? Any old time? The studies demonstrating the spacing effect do not control or vary the time of day, so in one sense, the answer is: it doesn’t matter - if it did matter, there would be considerable variance in how effective the effect is based on when a particular study had its subjects do their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one reviews at whatever time is convenient. Convenience makes one more likely to stick with it, and sticking with it overpowers any temporary improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one is not satisfied with that answer, then on general considerations, one ought to review before bedtime &amp;amp; sleep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory%20consolidation%23Spacing%20effect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Memory consolidation#Spacing effect&quot;&gt;Memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt; seems to be related, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep%20and%20memory&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Sleep and memory&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; is known to powerfully influence what memories enter long-term memory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033079&quot; title=&quot;Memory for Semantically Related and Unrelated Declarative Information: The Benefit of Sleep, the Cost of Wake&quot;&gt;strengthening memories&lt;/a&gt; of material learned close to bedtime and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130.full&quot; title=&quot;'REM, not incubation, improves creativity by priming associative networks', Cai et al 2009&quot;&gt;increasing creativity&lt;/a&gt;; interrupting sleep without affecting total sleep time or quality still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/07/20/1015633108&quot;&gt;damages memory formation in mice&lt;/a&gt;. So reviewing before bedtime would be best. (Other mental exercises show improvement when trained before bedtime; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/DNB-FAQ#sleep&quot;&gt;dual n-back&lt;/a&gt;.) One possible mechanism is that it may be that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/5/1563.full&quot; title=&quot;Sleep Selectively Enhances Memory Expected to Be of Future Relevance&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;expectancy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of future reviews/tests is enough to encourage memory consolidation during sleep; so if one reviews and goes to bed, presumably the expectancy is stronger than if one reviewed at breakfast and had an eventful day and forgot entirely about the reviewed flashcards. (See also the correlation between time of studying &amp;amp; GPA in Hartwig &amp;amp; Dunlosky 2012.) Neural growth may be related; from Stahl 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology underlying normal human memory formation have revealed that learning is not an event, but rather a process that unfolds over time.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876761/&quot; title=&quot;'Neurogenesis and the spacing effect: Learning over time enhances memory and the survival of new neurons', Sisti et al 2007&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650827/&quot; title=&quot;'Reconsolidation: maintaining memory relevance', Lee 2009&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/2010-oneill.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Play it again: reactivation of waking experience and memory', O'Neill et al 2010&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;,[Squire 2003 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Neuroscience-Second-Larry-Squire/dp/0126603030/?tag=gwernnet-20&quot;&gt;Fundamental Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;],&lt;a href=&quot;http://davidjf.free.fr/new/Xtech_scientific%20american_%20making%20memories%20stick.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Making Memories Stick', Fields 2005, Scientific American&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, it is not surprising that learning strategies that repeat materials over time enhance their retention.&lt;sup&gt;20,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1980-glenberg.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Spacing repetitions over 1 week', Glenberg &amp;amp; Lehmann 1980&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1991-toppino.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The effect of spacing repetitions on the recognition memory of young children and adults', Toppino et al 1991&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1978-landauer.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Optimum rehearsal patterns and name learning', Landauer &amp;amp; Bjork 1978&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~fournier/Teaching/psych592/Readings/Karpicke_et_al_2008.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning', Karpicke &amp;amp; Roediger 2008&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6698/bf91c9333faa0d333a800254b8063230d4f4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Optimizing retrieval as a learning event: When and why expanding retrieval practice enhances long-term retention', Storm et al 2010&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pashler.com/Articles/Pashler.Rohrer.Cepeda.Carpenter_2007.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Enhancing learning and retarding forgetting: Choices and consequences', Pashler et al 2007&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Thousands of new cells are generated in this region every day, although many of these cells die within weeks of their creation.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45c2/7c08fbb43f8728e69a7447366d4a4f74e088.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Adult neurogenesis produces a large pool of new granule cells in the dentate gyrus', Cameron &amp;amp; McKay 2001&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The survival of dentate gyrus neurons has been shown to be enhanced in animals when they are placed into learning situations.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; Animals that learn well retain more dentate gyrus neurons than do animals that do not learn well. Furthermore, 2 weeks after testing, animals trained in discrete spaced intervals over a period of time, rather than in a single presentation or a ‘massed trial’ of the same information, remember better.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; The precise mechanism that links neuronal survival with learning has not yet been identified. One theory is that the hippocampal neurons that preferentially survive are the ones that are somehow activated during the learning process.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; The distribution of learning over a period of time may be more effective in encouraging neuronal survival by allowing more time for changes in gene expression and protein synthesis that extend the life of neurons that are engaged in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Transferring memory from the encoding stage, which occurs during alert wakefulness, into consolidation must thus occur at a time when interference from ongoing new memory formation is reduced.&lt;sup&gt;17,18&lt;/sup&gt; One such time for this transfer is during sleep, especially during non-rapid eye movement sleep, when the hippocampus can communicate with other brain areas without interference from new experiences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d0a7/f06ed267f3193daab1175a65abb7a067bef4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Sleep, Learning, and Dreams: Off-line Memory Reprocessing', Stickgold et al 2001&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/77fd/0cf03de8a6c4f56c5decc7c47ebe69cf98c1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The contribution of sleep to hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation', Marshall &amp;amp; Born 2007&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/2001-maquet.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The Role of Sleep in Learning and Memory', Maquet et al 2001&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe that is why some decisions are better made after a good night’s rest and also why pulling an all-nighter, studying with sleep deprivation, may allow you to pass an exam an hour later but not remember the material a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;prospects-extended-flashcards&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#prospects-extended-flashcards&quot; title=&quot;Link to section: 'Prospects: extended flashcards'&quot;&gt;Prospects: extended flashcards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back for a moment. What are all our flashcards, small and large, doing for us? Why do I have a pair of flashcards for the word ‘anent’ among many others? I can just look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look ups take time compared to already knowing something. (Let’s ignore the previously discussed 5 minute rule.) If we think about this abstractly in a computer science context, we might recognize it as an old concept in algorithms &amp;amp; optimization discussions - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space-time%20tradeoff&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: space-time tradeoff&quot;&gt;space-time tradeoff&lt;/a&gt;. We trade off lookup time against limited skull space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the sort of factual data already given as examples - we might one day need to know the average annual rainfall in Honolulu or Austin, but it would require too much space to memorize such data for all capitals. There are millions of English words, but in practice any more than 100,000 is excessive. More surprising is a sort of procedural knowledge. An extreme form of space-time tradeoffs in computers is when a computation is replaced by pre-calculated constants. We could take a math &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function%20%28mathematics%29&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Function (mathematics)&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; and calculate its output for each possible input. Usually such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lookup%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: lookup table&quot;&gt;lookup table&lt;/a&gt; of input to output is really large. Think about how many entries would be in such a table for all possible integer multiplications between 1 and 1 billion. But sometimes the table is really small (like binary Boolean functions) or small (like trigonometric tables) or large but still useful (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: rainbow table&quot;&gt;rainbow table&lt;/a&gt;s usually start in the gigabytes and easily reach terabytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given an infinitely large lookup table, we could replace &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; the skill of, say, addition or multiplication by the lookup table. No computation. The space-time tradeoff taken to the extreme of the space side of the continuum. (We could go the other way and define multiplication or addition as the slow computation which doesn’t know any specifics like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiplication%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: multiplication table&quot;&gt;multiplication table&lt;/a&gt; - as if every time you wanted to add &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mn&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo MJXc-space2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mn MJXc-space2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you had to count on 4 fingers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So suppose we were children who wanted to learn multiplication. SRS and Mnemosyne can’t help because multiplication is not a specific factoid? The space-time tradeoff shows us that we can de-proceduralize multiplication and turn it partly into factoids. It wouldn’t be hard for us to write a quick script or macro to generate, say, 500 random cards which ask us to multiply AB by XY, and import them to Mnemosyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, which is your mind going to do - get good at multiplying 2 numbers (generate on-demand), or memorize 500 different multiplication problems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoize&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: memoize&quot;&gt;memoize&lt;/a&gt;)? From my experience with multiple subtle variants on a card, the mind gives up after just a few and falls back on a problem-solving approach - which is exactly what one wants to exercise, in this case. Congratulations; you have done the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a software engineering point of view, we might want to modify or improve the cards, and 500 snippets of text would be a tad hard to update. So coolest would be a ‘dynamic card’. Add a markup type like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;eval src=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; , and then Mnemosyne feeds the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; argument straight into the Python interpreter, which returns a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuple&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: tuple&quot;&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt; of the question text and the answer text. The question text is displayed to the user as usual, the user thinks, requests the answer, and grades himself. In Anki, Javascript is supported directly by the application in HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags (currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_javascript&quot;&gt;inline only&lt;/a&gt; but Anki could presumably import libraries by default), for example for kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ojisanseiuchi.com/2016/03/12/JavaScript-in-Anki-cards/&quot; title=&quot;Javascript in Anki cards&quot;&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/a&gt;, so any kind of dynamic card could be written that one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for multiplication, the dynamic card would get 2 random integers, print a question like &lt;code&gt;x * y = ?&lt;/code&gt; and then print the result as the answer. Every so often you would get a new multiplication question, and as you get better at multiplication, you see it less often - exactly as you should. Still in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/hvqzd/printable_math_flashcards_in_pdf_and_latex_source/c1yror5&quot;&gt;math vein&lt;/a&gt;, you could generate variants on formulas or programs where one version is the correct one and the others are subtly wrong; I do this by hand with my programming flashcards (especially if I make an error doing exercises, that signals a finer point to make several flashcards on), but it can be done automatically. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/4e5n&quot;&gt;kpreid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/4e5n&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; one tool of his:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.4985337243402&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kpreid/mathquiz/&quot;&gt;a program&lt;/a&gt; (in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kpreid.github.com/mathquiz/mathquiz.html&quot;&gt;a web page&lt;/a&gt;) which does a specialized form of this [generating ‘damaged formulas’]. It has a set of generators of formulas and damaged formulas, and presents you with a list containing several formulas of the same type (e.g. ∫ 2x dx = x^2 + C) but with one damaged (e.g. ∫ 2x dx = 2x^2 + C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach generalizes to anything you can generate random problems of or have large databases of examples of. Khan Academy apparently does something like this in associating large numbers of (algorithmicly-generated?) problems with each of its little modules and tracking retention of the skill in order to decide when to do further review of that module. For example, maybe you are studying Go and are interested in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life%20and%20death&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Life and death&quot;&gt;life-and-death positions&lt;/a&gt;. Those are things that can be generated by computer Go programs, or fetched from places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goproblems.com&quot;&gt;GoProblems.com&lt;/a&gt;. For even more examples, Go is rotationally invariant - the best move remains the same regardless of which way the board is oriented and since there is no canonical direction for the board (like in chess) a good player ought to be able to play the same no matter how the board looks - so each specific example can be mirrored in 3 other ways. Or one could test one’s ability to ‘read’ a board by writing a dynamic card which takes each example board/problem and adds some random pieces as long as some go-playing program like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20Go&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: GNU Go&quot;&gt;GNU Go&lt;/a&gt; says the best move hasn’t changed because of the added noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could learn an awful lot of things this way. Programming languages could be learned this way - someone learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell%20%28programming%20language%29&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Haskell (programming language)&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; could take all the functions listed in the Prelude or his Haskell textbook, and ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: QuickCheck&quot;&gt;QuickCheck&lt;/a&gt; to generate random arguments for the functions and ask the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow%20Haskell%20Compiler&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Glasgow Haskell Compiler&quot;&gt;GHC&lt;/a&gt; interpreter &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; what the function and its arguments evaluate to. Games other than go, like chess, may work (a live example being &lt;a href=&quot;http://chesstempo.com/user-guide/en/probSearchSpacedRepetition.html&quot;&gt;Chess Tempo&lt;/a&gt;, and see the experience of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfan.org/blog/2013/07/07/mnemosyne-part-3/&quot; title=&quot;I'll mostly discuss my experience using it for chess, since that's what the majority of my 8000 cards are...&quot;&gt;Dan Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;). A fair bit of mathematics. If the dynamic card has Internet access, it can pull down fresh questions from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS%20feed&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: RSS feed&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; or just a website; this functionality could be quite useful in a foreign language learning context with every day bringing a fresh sentence to translate or another exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some NLP software, one could write dynamic flashcards which test all sorts of things: if one confuses verbs, the program could take a template like “$PRONOUN $VERB $PARTICLE $OBJECT % {right: caresse, wrong: caresses}” which yields flashcards like “Je caresses le chat” or “Tu caresse le chat” and one would have to decide whether it was the correct conjugation. (The dynamicism here would help prevent memorizing specific sentences rather than the underlying conjugation.) In full generality, this would probably be difficult, but simpler approaches like templates may work well enough. Jack Kinsella:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there were dynamic SRS decks for language learning (or other disciplines). Such decks would count the number of times you have reviewed an instance of an underlying grammatical rule or an instance of a particular piece of vocabulary, for example its singular/plural/third person conjugation/dative form. These sophisticated decks would present users with fresh example sentences on every review, thereby preventing users from remembering specific answers and compelling them to learn the process of applying the grammatical rule afresh. Moreover, these decks would keep users entertained through novelty and would present users with tacit learning opportunities through rotating vocabulary used in non-essential parts of the example sentence. Such a system, with multiple-level review rotation, would not only prevent against overfit learning, but also increase the total amount of knowledge learned per minute, an efficiency I’d gladly invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these things seem like ‘skills’ and not ‘data’!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;8c79&quot; id=&quot;8c79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;3 years ago, we wrote ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/what-does-unsplash-cost-b14d5bbf30f6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/what-does-unsplash-cost-b14d5bbf30f6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;What does Unsplash cost?&lt;/a&gt;’ to give a totally transparent look at the bills associated with hosting one of the largest photography sites in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af92&quot; id=&quot;af92&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since then, Unsplash has continued to grow tremendously, now powering more image use than the major image media incumbents, Shutterstock, Getty, and Adobe, combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3345&quot; id=&quot;3345&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/developers&quot; data-href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/developers&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unsplash’s public API&lt;/a&gt;, we power over 1000+ mainstream applications, including Medium, Trello, Squarespace, Tencent, Naver, Square, Adobe, and Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;67a5&quot; id=&quot;67a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of that growth means two things: more traffic and bigger bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a71&quot; id=&quot;4a71&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the interest of transparency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisliverani&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisliverani&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; and I thought we were overdue for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa61&quot; id=&quot;fa61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s 2019. What does it cost to host Unsplash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;522f&quot; id=&quot;522f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Then&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f21&quot; id=&quot;9f21&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/what-does-unsplash-cost-b14d5bbf30f6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/what-does-unsplash-cost-b14d5bbf30f6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Unsplash had just crossed 1 billion images viewed and 5.5M photos downloaded per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1ba1&quot; id=&quot;1ba1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our team was smaller and our product was a lot less developed, which led to less services and less in-house processing. We had one main application, a traditional Rails monolith, that consumed a handful of services to create the basic Unsplash experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8273&quot; id=&quot;8273&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Heavy features like search and realtime photo stats were in their infancy, which led to much simpler data processing requirements and the use of 3rd party services like Keen and a handful of CRON jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;107d&quot; id=&quot;107d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The final monthly breakdown for April 2016 was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;d0b3&quot; id=&quot;d0b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Web Servers: $2,731.23&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li name=&quot;b3d8&quot; id=&quot;b3d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Data Processing: $1,000.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3793&quot; id=&quot;3793&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Image Hosting: $11,170.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;16c6&quot; id=&quot;16c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Other: $2,127.39&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;9372&quot; id=&quot;9372&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Total (USD): $17,658.62&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9e50&quot; id=&quot;9e50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d164&quot; id=&quot;d164&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;A lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;76d6&quot; id=&quot;76d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For one, Unsplash is a hell of a lot bigger. 10+ times bigger. We now get more traffic from our API partners than our own website and official apps, despite these growing significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;18ee&quot; id=&quot;18ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/developers&quot; data-href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/developers&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some of the largest consumer facing apps in the world&lt;/a&gt; has pushed our engineering team to match their practices around redundancy, monitoring, and availability, which requires more supporting resources and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c154&quot; id=&quot;c154&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our product team has continued to push the envelope for core features like search and contributor stats, requiring more and more data to be processed in greater and greater volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b18f&quot; id=&quot;b18f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of these things have pushed our architecture to be more complex, while also increasing the baseline costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1776&quot; id=&quot;1776&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Web servers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7020&quot; id=&quot;7020&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Total monthly cost: $29,763&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;de2b&quot; id=&quot;de2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We continue to use Heroku as our main web platform. Despite its premium cost over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, Heroku’s built-in deployment and configuration tools allow our team to move faster, more confidently, and more reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5caa&quot; id=&quot;5caa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/scaling-unsplash-with-a-small-team-fbdd55571906&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/unsplash/scaling-unsplash-with-a-small-team-fbdd55571906&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we’ve detailed previously&lt;/a&gt;, the alternatives would undoubtably be cheaper on paper. But in reality, the increased simplicity and freedom offered by Heroku for a small, product-focused team is a major cost savings advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;66c3&quot; id=&quot;66c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition to our main web servers and databases using Heroku, we use Fastly for distributed CDN caching, Elastic Cloud for our Elasticsearch clusters, and Stream for our feed and notification architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9f4e&quot; id=&quot;9f4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our team is small for Unsplash’s size, with our total product team counting in at just 11 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1692&quot; id=&quot;1692&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With no one dedicated to dev-ops, ensuring Unsplash is running smoothly and never goes down, requires a lot of instrumentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d07c&quot; id=&quot;d07c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Despite the volume of metrics we monitor and report on, New Relic, Sentry, and Datadog remain fairly inexpensive solutions. Our logging is certainly our largest monitoring expense, but the detailed information is crucial when debugging issues or rolling out new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c817&quot; id=&quot;c817&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Data processing has been the area with the largest relative increase since 2016. Back then, analytics and data were an afterthought in our development process. We relied on tools like Google Analytics for user analytics and Keen for product metrics like photo views and downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3050&quot; id=&quot;3050&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since then, we’ve needed to expand our data collection, aggregation, and reporting significantly, both from a product and a company perspective. As Unsplash has grown, the volume has also increased considerably, with hundreds of millions of events tracked every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a4fc&quot; id=&quot;a4fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’ve replaced Google Analytics and Keen with an open-source data pipeline, &lt;a href=&quot;https://snowplowanalytics.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://snowplowanalytics.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Snowplow Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Snowplow takes care of the data collection and formatting, allowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timmycarbone&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timmycarbone&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;, our data engineer, to focus on data aggregation, modelling, and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2818&quot; id=&quot;2818&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’ve also expanded the role of the data architecture in the product to handle all of our machine learning and search processing. As we go forward, we expect this to continue to be the biggest area of expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
