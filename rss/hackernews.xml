<title>Complex Systems Fail</title>
<link>https://how.complexsystems.fail</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://how.complexsystems.fail</guid>
<description>&lt;li id=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;3.5583864118896&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own nature. The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and irreducibly hazardous. It is the presence of these hazards that drives the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;2&quot; readability=&quot;7.9802955665025&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high consequences of failure lead over time to the construction of multiple layers of defense against failure. These defenses include obvious technical components (e.g. backup systems, ‘safety’ features of equipment) and human components (e.g. training, knowledge) but also a variety of organizational, institutional, and regulatory defenses (e.g. policies and procedures, certification, work rules, team training). The effect of these measures is to provide a series of shields that normally divert operations away from accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;3&quot; readability=&quot;4.3993993993994&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The array of defenses works. System operations are generally successful. Overt catastrophic failure occurs when small, apparently innocuous failures join to create opportunity for a systemic accident. Each of these small failures is necessary to cause catastrophe but only the combination is sufficient to permit failure. Put another way, there are many more failure opportunities than overt system accidents. Most initial failure trajectories are blocked by designed system safety components. Trajectories that reach the operational level are mostly blocked, usually by practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4&quot; readability=&quot;3.5059221658206&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of these systems makes it impossible for them to run without multiple flaws being present. Because these are individually insufficient to cause failure they are regarded as minor factors during operations. Eradication of all latent failures is limited primarily by economic cost but also because it is difficult before the fact to see how such failures might contribute to an accident. The failures change constantly because of changing technology, work organization, and efforts to eradicate failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;5&quot; readability=&quot;5.6782608695652&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corollary to the preceding point is that complex systems run as broken systems. The system continues to function because it contains so many redundancies and because people can make it function, despite the presence of many flaws. After accident reviews nearly always note that the system has a history of prior ‘proto-accidents’ that nearly generated catastrophe. Arguments that these degraded conditions should have been recognized before the overt accident are usually predicated on naïve notions of system performance. System operations are dynamic, with components (organizational, human, technical) failing and being replaced continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;6&quot; readability=&quot;1.8196392785571&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex systems possess potential for catastrophic failure. Human practitioners are nearly always in close physical and temporal proximity to these potential failures – disaster can occur at any time and in nearly any place. The potential for catastrophic outcome is a hallmark of complex systems. It is impossible to eliminate the potential for such catastrophic failure; the potential for such failure is always present by the system’s own nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;7&quot; readability=&quot;6.335092348285&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because overt failure requires multiple faults, there is no isolated ‘cause’ of an accident. There are multiple contributors to accidents. Each of these is necessarily insufficient in itself to create an accident. Only jointly are these causes sufficient to create an accident. Indeed, it is the linking of these causes together that creates the circumstances required for the accident. Thus, no isolation of the ‘root cause’ of an accident is possible. The evaluations based on such reasoning as ‘root cause’ do not reflect a technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or events for outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://how.complexsystems.fail/#footnote-1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8&quot; readability=&quot;2.7230113636364&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the outcome makes it seem that events leading to the outcome should have appeared more salient to practitioners at the time than was actually the case. This means that &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; accident analysis of human performance is inaccurate. The outcome knowledge poisons the ability of after-accident observers to recreate the view of practitioners before the accident of those same factors. It seems that practitioners “should have known” that the factors would “inevitably” lead to an accident. &lt;a href=&quot;https://how.complexsystems.fail/#footnote-2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hindsight bias remains the primary obstacle to accident investigation, especially when expert human performance is involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;9&quot; readability=&quot;6.1669242658423&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system practitioners operate the system in order to produce its desired product and also work to forestall accidents. This dynamic quality of system operation, the balancing of demands for production against the possibility of incipient failure is unavoidable. Outsiders rarely acknowledge the duality of this role. In non-accident filled times, the production role is emphasized. After accidents, the defense against failure role is emphasized. At either time, the outsider’s view misapprehends the operator’s constant, simultaneous engagement with both roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;10&quot; readability=&quot;5.647619047619&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After accidents, the overt failure often appears to have been inevitable and the practitioner’s actions as blunders or deliberate willful disregard of certain impending failure. But all practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take place in the face of uncertain outcomes. The degree of uncertainty may change from moment to moment. That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt; analysis regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;11&quot; readability=&quot;8.2578947368421&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the relationship between production targets, efficient use of resources, economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks of low and high consequence accidents. All ambiguity is resolved by actions of practitioners at the sharp end of the system. After an accident, practitioner actions may be regarded as ‘errors’ or ‘violations’ but these evaluations are heavily biased by hindsight and ignore the other driving forces, especially production pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;12&quot; readability=&quot;1.8088235294118&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize production and minimize accidents. These adaptations often occur on a moment by moment basis. Some of these adaptations include: (1) Restructuring the system in order to reduce exposure of vulnerable parts to failure. (2) Concentrating critical resources in areas of expected high demand. (3) Providing pathways for retreat or recovery from expected and unexpected faults. (4) Establishing means for early detection of changed system performance in order to allow graceful cutbacks in production or other means of increasing resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;13&quot; readability=&quot;4.6008403361345&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex systems require substantial human expertise in their operation and management. This expertise changes in character as technology changes but it also changes because of the need to replace experts who leave. In every case, training and refinement of skill and expertise is one part of the function of the system itself. At any moment, therefore, a given complex system will contain practitioners and trainees with varying degrees of expertise. Critical issues related to expertise arise from (1) the need to use scarce expertise as a resource for the most difficult or demanding production needs and (2) the need to develop expertise for future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;14&quot; readability=&quot;10.556818181818&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low rate of overt accidents in reliable systems may encourage changes, especially the use of new technology, to decrease the number of low consequence but high frequency failures. These changes maybe actually create opportunities for new, low frequency but high consequence failures. When new technologies are used to eliminate well understood system failures or to gain high precision performance they often introduce new pathways to large scale, catastrophic failures. Not uncommonly, these new, rare catastrophes have even greater impact than those eliminated by the new technology. These new forms of failure are difficult to see before the fact; attention is paid mostly to the putative beneficial characteristics of the changes. Because these new, high consequence accidents occur at a low rate, multiple system changes may occur before an accident, making it hard to see the contribution of technology to the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;15&quot; readability=&quot;2.6535087719298&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-accident remedies for “human error” are usually predicated on obstructing activities that can “cause” accidents. These end-of-the-chain measures do little to reduce the likelihood of further accidents. In fact that likelihood of an identical accident is already extraordinarily low because the pattern of latent failures changes constantly. Instead of increasing safety, post-accident remedies usually increase the coupling and complexity of the system. This increases the potential number of latent failures and also makes the detection and blocking of accident trajectories more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;16&quot; readability=&quot;2.6361940298507&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a person, device or department of an organization or system. Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system. This means that safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The state of safety in any system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its management are constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;17&quot; readability=&quot;6.6315789473684&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who work to keep the system within the boundaries of tolerable performance. These activities are, for the most part, part of normal operations and superficially straightforward. But because system operations are never trouble free, human practitioner adaptations to changing conditions actually create safety from moment to moment. These adaptations often amount to just the selection of a well-rehearsed routine from a store of available responses; sometimes, however, the adaptations are novel combinations or de novo creations of new approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;18&quot; readability=&quot;4.6634615384615&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing hazard and successfully manipulating system operations to remain inside the tolerable performance boundaries requires intimate contact with failure. More robust system performance is likely to arise in systems where operators can discern the “edge of the envelope”. This is where system performance begins to deteriorate, becomes difficult to predict, or cannot be readily recovered. In intrinsically hazardous systems, operators are expected to encounter and appreciate hazards in ways that lead to overall performance that is desirable. Improved safety depends on providing operators with calibrated views of the hazards. It also depends on providing calibration about how their actions move system performance towards or away from the edge of the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, the governing board of one of California’s most powerful regulatory agencies unleashed troubling accusations against its top employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;Commissioners with the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, accused Executive Director Alice Stebbins of violating state personnel rules by hiring former colleagues without proper qualifications. They said the agency chief misled the public by asserting that as much as $200 million was missing from accounts intended to fund programs for the state’s blind, deaf and poor. At a hearing in August, Commission President Marybel Batjer said that Stebbins had discredited the CPUC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;“You took a series of actions over the course of several years that calls into question your integrity,” Batjer told Stebbins, who joined the agency in 2018. Those actions, she said, “cause us to have to consider whether you can continue to serve as the leader of this agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;The five commissioners voted unanimously to terminate Stebbins, who had worked as an auditor and budget analyst for different state agencies for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;But an investigation by the Bay City News Foundation and ProPublica has found that Stebbins was right about the missing money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;Just days before Stebbins was fired, CPUC officials told California’s Department of Finance that the agency was owed more than $200 million, according to a memo obtained by the news organizations. The finance agency launched an investigation into the uncollected funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;The news organizations’ investigation also found flaws in the State Personnel Board report that Batjer used to terminate Stebbins. Three former CPUC employees said in interviews that the report contained falsehoods. The report alleged that the auditor who discovered the missing money was unqualified. But hiring materials obtained by the news organizations show that state officials had determined that the auditor was the most qualified candidate, awarding him an “excellent” rating in every category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;6.0&quot;&gt;Batjer, a former casino executive, was appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to lead the commission in July 2019, the same month Stebbins briefed the commissioners on problems with the agency’s accounting practices. Early on, Batjer scrutinized Stebbins’ personnel decisions, according to previously unreported text messages obtained by the news organizations. Shortly after she was sworn in as president in August, Batjer texted a former colleague in Newsom’s cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets-c3.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20201224-batjer.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets-c3.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20201224-batjer.jpg 400w, https://assets-c3.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20201224-batjer.jpg 800w, https://assets-c3.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20201224-batjer.jpg 1600w, https://assets-c3.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20201224-batjer.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw&quot;/&gt; Marybel Batjer speaking in 2019, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom looks on. &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(Rich Pedroncelli/AP Photo)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;8.0&quot;&gt;Batjer told Julie Lee, who was serving as California’s acting secretary of Government Operations, or GovOps, that she was “very concerned”: She believed the auditor was not qualified for the job and was upset that Stebbins had given him a raise after putting him in charge of additional employees. Batjer had previously served as head of GovOps, which oversees the State Personnel Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.0&quot;&gt;“I find this outrageous!” Batjer wrote to her old colleague. “I’m terribly worried. Thanks much for any advice/help you can get before this gets much worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.1&quot;&gt;“Let’s get together and figure this out!” Lee responded. “We will help you fix, don’t stress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;10.0&quot;&gt;The commissioners appear to have violated state transparency laws when they later exchanged text messages among themselves about whether to fire Stebbins. California law prohibits the majority of a public body from discussing matters under its jurisdiction outside of a regular meeting, particularly to build a consensus, legal experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.0&quot;&gt;“I can’t imagine her remaining,” Batjer wrote a fellow commissioner in a private text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;12.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins filed a wrongful termination suit against the CPUC this month. In a series of interviews, the most extensive since her termination, she described an agency mired in disorganization and ineptitude. An experienced administrator, she was recruited by the previous president to clean up a dysfunctional agency. She found some of her employees did not know basic information about the utilities they were supposed to be regulating — in one case, lacking even current contact information for regulated water companies. Audits dating back to 2012 had found ineffective budget management and a need for improved fiscal monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.0&quot;&gt;“You’ve got just systemic issues,” Stebbins said in an interview. “The only way you can make those changes is to really tear it apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;15.0&quot;&gt;Batjer did not respond to requests for an interview. The other commissioners did not return emails seeking comment. The CPUC has not yet responded to Stebbins’ lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Lee denied that she triggered or influenced the investigation into Stebbins. The State Personnel Board declined to comment on their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;16.0&quot;&gt;In response to detailed questions, commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said that Stebbins’ allegation of $200 million in missing fines and fees was the result of a misunderstanding of the commission’s accounting practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;17.0&quot;&gt;Prosper did not address the apparent open meeting violations, citing pending litigation. But she said Stebbins’ manipulation of the hiring process warranted her dismissal. She acknowledged “some inaccuracies” in the state personnel report but dismissed them as “nonsubstantive details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;18.0&quot;&gt;“Her allegation that she was dismissed for finding alleged budget irregularities flies in the face of the clear public action taken by the CPUC,” Prosper said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Cleanup Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;19.0&quot;&gt;The CPUC was formed in the early 20th century to regulate railroads. Since then, numerous other industries have been placed under its oversight, including giant electric and gas monopolies, phone companies, water providers and transportation companies like Uber and Lyft, making it one of the most powerful agencies in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;20.0&quot;&gt;But in recent years, the CPUC has faced accusations that it has become too cozy with utilities. In 2010, a PG&amp;amp;E gas line exploded in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, killed eight and destroyed 30 homes. The CPUC president at the time, a former energy executive, resigned after it was revealed he and his staff were helping a PG&amp;amp;E executive pick the judge for an upcoming rate case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;21.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins was hired as the agency’s executive director in February 2018 to bring fresh scrutiny to its finances and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;22.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins was disturbed by what she found at the CPUC. Fiscal mismanagement and disorganization made holding utilities accountable impossible, she said. She ordered extensive audits of agency divisions, accounting practices and specialized programs for providing services to impoverished and disabled California residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;23.0&quot;&gt;She quickly fired the head of the Water Division, who oversaw 110 investor-owned utilities serving about 6.3 million residents. Stebbins said that the division wasn’t keeping basic records like contact information for the utilities it regulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;24.0&quot;&gt;An audit found division staff members were often not conducting required on-site visits and when they did, the inspections were brief and incomplete. When a utility was found out of compliance with regulations, the division rarely issued citations, even when violations persisted. One utility had been collecting fees from ratepayers for 19 years and failing to send the money to the CPUC, Stebbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;25.0&quot;&gt;“It was a nonfunctioning division, and it’s still for the most part nonfunctioning,” Stebbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Millions Past Due&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;27.0&quot;&gt;One audit Stebbins ordered found the CPUC was doing a poor job collecting on debts. It found $49.9 million in outstanding collections as of the end of 2019. That included more than $12 million in enforcement fines, more than $22 million in telecommunication fines and more than $14 million in reimbursable contracts. About $21.1 million had been due since before 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;28.0&quot;&gt;“Given that nearly $50 million is owed to the CPUC,” the audit said, “CPUC should investigate whether the program areas utilize appropriate collection efforts against companies with delinquent payments and to what extent follow up occurs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;29.0&quot;&gt;In a statement to the news organizations, the CPUC argued that it was aggressively collecting overdue fines and fees but that those efforts were mired in court actions or appeals. In particular, the agency said two defunct companies owed nearly $19.8 million in fines from a 2010 investigation. The matter was taken to court and an appeals court upheld a judgment in the CPUC’s favor in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;30.0&quot;&gt;The audit also hinted that there could be much more owed that is not accounted for in the official book of record. For certain surcharges and fees, the CPUC allows companies to self-report what they owe and does not track whether they have paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;32.0&quot;&gt;In early 2019, Stebbins hired Bernard Azevedo, a former colleague, as director of administrative services. Azevedo had been an accountant with the state for 30 years, most recently as a branch chief for the Air Resources Board. Among other things, Azevedo started looking carefully into the self-reported fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;33.0&quot;&gt;What he found shocked him. A large portion of the fees were collected as surcharges on customer bills, particularly phone bills, to fund vital assistance programs for poor and disabled people. But the CPUC was doing a poor job of tracking what the utilities owed, he said. Those in charge of the assistance programs were monitoring the money, rather than the accounting office. So at the end of each fiscal year, accountants simply reset the amount due to zero, assuming the fees had been collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;34.0&quot;&gt;Azevedo estimated that the utilities owed the CPUC more than $150 million beyond the $49 million identified in the audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;34.1&quot;&gt;“We don’t know what we’re collecting,” Azevedo said in an interview. “We don’t know who’s paying; we don’t know how much they’re paying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;34.2&quot;&gt;“I have real concerns,” Azevedo said. “This is a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;35.0&quot;&gt;Azevedo estimated that the Lifeline program, which provides phone service for low-income Californians, could be short $61 million. The Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, which provides devices to people with disabilities, could be missing $6.3 million. The California Teleconnect Fund, which provides low-cost service to schools, libraries, community colleges, hospitals, health clinics and other community organizations, had not received some $10 million owed by utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;36.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins alleges that the agency collected only $21 million in the 2018-19 fiscal year. Its strange accounting practices made it difficult to tell which utilities paid or if they paid the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;36.1&quot;&gt;“I’ve never seen it done this way by any organization I’ve worked for in 34 years in auditing and accounting for the state,” Stebbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;36.2&quot;&gt;During Stebbins’ termination hearing, Batjer said, “the CPUC did not have $200 million in uncollected fees” and pointed to the audit report, which found only $49.9 million was uncollected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;37.0&quot;&gt;But a letter from the CPUC’s outside counsel Suzanne Solomon that was sent to Stebbins’ attorneys a few days before Batjer’s remarks contradicted Batjer. Solomon acknowledged an additional $141 million owed as of June 2019 but argued that the CPUC expected to collect those fees the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;38.0&quot;&gt;In a statement, the CPUC alleged that Stebbins and her attorneys made “many false allegations” that “reflected a misunderstanding of the state’s accounting system and methods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;38.1&quot;&gt;Stebbins and Azevedo say that they are confident that they had discovered a real problem. But their investigation was cut short when they were both fired. Stebbins said, “I think there’s millions and millions of dollars more out there that have not been reported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A New Boss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;38.2&quot;&gt;In April 2020, two investigators with the State Personnel Board contacted Stebbins. They wanted to know about several recent hires. Stebbins didn’t think much of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;40.0&quot;&gt;But a month later, an attorney from the state Attorney General’s Office emailed her a draft report from the State Personnel Board that alleged she violated civil service rules and hired former colleagues who weren’t as qualified as other candidates. She was directed to submit a response within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;42.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins was bewildered. She said she found the report wildly inaccurate — she didn’t believe she had violated any civil services rules. She confronted several commissioners. “I had some fairly passionate discussions with commissioners. I honestly could not in any way convince them that the report was incorrect, none of them would listen to me,” Stebbins said. “It was weird because I had a good relationship with the commissioners and all of a sudden I didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;43.0&quot;&gt;Text messages reveal the commissioners were already deeply engaged in discussion about her termination. They complained about Stebbins’ behavior and consoled one another emotionally. They seemed taken aback by the vehemence of Stebbins’ arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;43.1&quot;&gt;On July 8, Commissioner Clifford Rechtschaffen wrote to Batjer, “It is clearly apparent that it’s untenable for her to stay working here and we should be working from that assumption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;43.2&quot;&gt;Batjer wrote back, “I can’t imagine her remaining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;43.3&quot;&gt;Rechtschaffen also wrote, “It’s not tenable for her to stay,” to Commissioner Liane Randolph the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;43.4&quot;&gt;“Poor Marybel is really struggling with this,” Rechtschaffen wrote to Randolph, who was recently nominated to head California’s Air Resources Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;45.0&quot;&gt;Under California’s Bagley-Keene Act, it is illegal for a majority of commissioners to discuss an issue among themselves outside of a meeting. It is legal for two commissioners to discuss issues between themselves, but if they relay it to a majority outside of a meeting, it becomes illegal. In the case of the CPUC, a majority is three commissioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;46.0&quot;&gt;Public officials who violate the law can face misdemeanor criminal charges, but it is rarely enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;46.1&quot;&gt;“You can’t do anything outside of a public meeting that results in a discussion between a majority,” said Kelly Aviles, an attorney specializing in government transparency. “You can’t do anything indirectly that you can’t do directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;47.0&quot;&gt;Some topics, such as personnel matters, can be withheld from public view by discussing them in a private session, but the closed sessions must be conducted the same way as any other meeting. For a discussion to be private, the members must cite law that allows the topic to be discussed in a closed meeting. “Just because you can discuss something in closed session, it doesn’t allow this kind of free-for-all and you can now discuss it outside of meetings,” Aviles said. “You can’t. You’re bound by the same requirement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;48.0&quot;&gt;As the weeks went on, the agreement between the commissioners to fire Stebbins grew stronger. On July 14, Randolph summed up the results of the commissioners’ text stream: “We all agree” to fire Stebbins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;49.0&quot;&gt;Aviles said that building a consensus outside of a public meeting is also a violation. “You’re not even supposed to be discussing matters that are in the body’s subject matter jurisdiction outside of a public meeting. The fact that they’re coming to a consensus is just the cherry on top,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fired&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;50.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins was placed on administrative league leave on Aug. 4. A few days later, Batjer took the unusual step of sending the State Personnel Board report to all 1,400 CPUC employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;50.1&quot;&gt;Batjer used the report to justify firing Stebbins at the public hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;51.0&quot;&gt;“It is appalling and disgraceful to engineer the hiring of a marginally qualified former colleague over more qualified candidates, spike the person’s pay and then make false statements attempting to justify the compensation,” Batjer said during Stebbins’ termination hearing, making an apparent reference to Azevedo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;52.0&quot;&gt;But interviews and documents show numerous inaccuracies in the report. For instance, investigators understated Azevedo’s qualifications. Azevedo, the report said, did not have experience with budgets or facilities management. But he had previously served as branch chief at the Air Resources Board for nine years, where he managed a staff of 65, implemented a new fiscal management system and created an internal audit unit. According to Azevedo’s appeal, each other candidate had a decade less experience in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;53.0&quot;&gt;Notes from Azevedo’s interview, reviewed by the news organizations, showed his responses were rated “excellent” in all categories, well above the other candidates for his position. The report alleged that the agency’s human resources department later determined that other candidates should have received better scores, but offered no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;55.0&quot;&gt;As to the raise, Stebbins increased Azevedo’s salary from $10,010 to $14,922 per month after putting him in charge of several additional departments. The personnel board argued that Azevedo wasn’t eligible for such a large raise and the job should have been readvertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;57.0&quot;&gt;Batjer went on to accuse Stebbins of trying to cover up her misconduct. “You repeatedly suggested that the commissioners should use our political influence to — in your words — make the SPB report go away,” Batjer said. “The commissioners took an oath to uphold the California Constitution, including the merit system rules, and your suggestion was abhorrent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;58.0&quot;&gt;Stebbins acknowledged saying the report should “go away” but said that she had only wanted the commissioners to hear her out and recognize that the report’s allegations were false. Once they did, she thought the issue would go away. “None of it’s relevant, none of it’s real, none of it’s true, and they did not want to listen,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Private Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;59.0&quot;&gt;For the first time in more than 30 years, Stebbins now finds herself out of government work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;60.0&quot;&gt;Her time is spent these days preparing for her lawsuit: cataloging her experiences for her lawyers, filing public records requests and preparing her testimony. But many of her goals remain the same, she said, including effecting change in the agency and uncovering the depth of its fiscal morass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;61.0&quot;&gt;“A couple people warned me, they said, ‘Be careful, this isn’t going to be favored, people aren’t going to like you, because you’re doing things nobody’s ever done,’” Stebbins said. “When I finally was terminated, one of my team said to me, ‘You’re the first person who came in here, you effectuated change, you made stuff happen, you were cleaning up the organization and they fired you.’”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>API pagination design</title>
<link>https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GET /api/products?page=10
{&quot;items&quot;: [...100 products]}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and to continue you make a request like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GET /api/products?page=11
{&quot;items&quot;: [...another 100 products]}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of a simple offset it’ll look like &lt;code&gt;?offset=1000&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?offset=1100&lt;/code&gt; — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like &lt;code&gt;OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100&lt;/code&gt; or will be multiplied by page size (that &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GET /api/products
{&quot;items&quot;: [...100 products],
 &quot;cursor&quot;: &quot;qWe&quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{&quot;items&quot;: [...100 products],
 &quot;cursor&quot;: &quot;qWr&quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashids.org/&quot;&gt;hashids&lt;/a&gt;). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like &lt;code&gt;WHERE id &amp;gt; :cursor LIMIT 100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;

&lt;p&gt;That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There &lt;a href=&quot;https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854&quot;&gt;tie breaker&lt;/a&gt;). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What If You Could Do It All Over?</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/21/what-if-you-could-do-it-all-over</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/21/what-if-you-could-do-it-all-over</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A whole art form—the novel—has been dedicated to exploring this dynamic. Novelists often show us people who, trapped by circumstances, struggle to live their “real” lives. Such a struggle can be Escher-like; a “real” life is one in which a person no longer yearns to find herself, and yet the work of finding oneself is itself a source of meaning. In Tolstoy’s “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/a&gt;,” Anna, caught in a boring marriage, destroys her life in an attempt to build a more passionate, authentic one with Count Vronsky. All the while, Levin, the novel’s other hero, is so confused about how to live that he longs for the kind of boring, automatic life that Anna left behind. Part of the work of being a modern person seems to be dreaming of alternate lives in which you don’t have to dream of alternate lives. We long to stop longing, but we also wring purpose from that desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading&quot;&gt;An “unled” life sounds like one we might wish to lead—shoulda, coulda, woulda. But, while I’m conscious of my unlived lives, I don’t wish to have led one. In fact, as the father of a two-year-old, I find the prospect frightening. In “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Midlife-Philosophical-Guide-Kieran-Setiya/dp/0691173931/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Midlife%3A+A+Philosophical+Guide&amp;amp;qid=1607966961&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Midlife-Philosophical-Guide-Kieran-Setiya/dp/0691173931/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Midlife%3A+A+Philosophical+Guide&amp;amp;qid=1607966961&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Midlife: A Philosophical Guide&lt;/a&gt;,” the philosopher Kieran Setiya points out that, thanks to the “butterfly effect,” even minor alterations to our pasts would likely have major effects on our presents. If I’d done things just a little bit differently, my son might not exist. Perhaps, in a different life, I’d have a different wife and child. But I love these particular people; I don’t want alternative ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it easier to imagine different lives for others. My mother grew up in Malaysia, then immigrated to America in the nineteen-seventies, as a college student. In her new country, she went to rock concerts, poetry readings, and law school, becoming an attorney with a distinguished career and achieving the kind of life she’d imagined back home. Even so, she was never really happy; she and my father divorced, and she struggled with depression and loneliness. When I was a teen-ager, we visited Malaysia together. I was astonished to find that the island where she’d spent her childhood was a tropical paradise. Her many cousins and old friends were overjoyed to see her; eating the food, her face lit up. We spent a day with a high-school boyfriend of hers, who ran a small factory (it made refrigerator magnets, as I recall); globalization was transforming the country and raising the standard of living. Would my mother have found contentment if she’d forgone the immigrant struggle? Thinking that she might have, I didn’t worry that, if she’d lived this alternate life, I wouldn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother was young when she moved across the world; once we’re rooted in adulthood, even much smaller shifts can seem inconceivable. My lawyer friend, who has a wife and two children, hates his job and is always talking about leaving it so that he can pursue an entirely different profession, but he simply can’t figure out how to make the switch. I feel for him. Having clambered up his ladder, he won’t easily get down. But I also want to tell him what Jean-Paul Sartre said about the allure of imaginary lives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-embed blockquote-embed--has-paragraph-margin blockquote-embed--has-small-margins&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-embed__content&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh. . . . But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations, and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sartre thought we should focus on what we have done and will do, rather than on what we might have done or could do. He pointed out that we often take too narrow a census of our actions. An artist, he maintains, is not to be “judged solely by his works of art, for a thousand other things also help to define him.” We do more than we give ourselves credit for; our real lives are richer than we think. This is why, if you keep a diary, you may feel more satisfied with the life you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet you may still wonder at the particular shape of that life; all stories have turning points, and it’s hard not to fixate on them. Sartre advanced those ideas in a lecture called “Existentialism Is a Humanism,” which he delivered in Paris in 1945, when he was only locally famous. On arriving at the venue, he discovered that he would have to push through a brawling crowd that had gathered in a sort of mini-riot. (“Probably some communists demonstrating against me,” he speculated, according to Annie Cohen-Solal’s “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Jean-Paul-Sartre-Life-Lives-Left/dp/1565849744/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=sartre+a+life&amp;amp;qid=1607967127&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Jean-Paul-Sartre-Life-Lives-Left/dp/1565849744/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=sartre+a+life&amp;amp;qid=1607967127&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sartre: A Life&lt;/a&gt;.”) He considered leaving the event but then decided to press on, spending fifteen minutes making his way to the front, receiving a few kicks and blows along the way. The lecture was a sensation and made Sartre an international superstar. That might not have happened if he’d decided, reasonably, to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like facets in a jewel, such moments seem to put our lives into prismatic relief. They make us feel the precariousness and the specificity of the way things are. In “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Birthday-World-Novel-P-S/dp/0061187895/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=the+post+birthday+world&amp;amp;qid=1607967158&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Birthday-World-Novel-P-S/dp/0061187895/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=the+post+birthday+world&amp;amp;qid=1607967158&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Post-Birthday World&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/01/lionel-shriver-is-looking-for-trouble&quot;&gt;Lionel Shriver&lt;/a&gt; builds a whole novel around this conceit: its chapters alternate between two time lines, one in which Irina, its protagonist, didn’t kiss her husband’s friend, and another in which she did. (In the first time line, she often thinks back on the moment of the almost-kiss—an instant when her happy life hung in the balance.) The same essential premise animates countless popular narratives, from rom-coms like “Sliding Doors” to sci-fi series like “Devs.” And yet the premise is irrational: in truth, our lives have infinite facets, and, for any given outcome, the turning points we isolate are necessary but not sufficient. The butterfly effect works in reverse: Sartre had to give his lecture, and my wife had to step into my elevator not just once but twice, and yet many other, unremembered things also had to happen—in fact, everything had to go a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, these stories serve a didactic purpose; they provoke thoughts that bind us to our lives. They suggest that we should be grateful for what’s actual—that we should sink deeper into the life we have, rather than dreaming of the lives we don’t. But my mother, being unhappy, and restless by nature, thought often of her unled lives. Sometimes she seemed lost in them, or misled by them. She dreamed, in particular, of quitting her job and running a farm stand. And so, the summer after I graduated from college, she moved out of the D.C. suburbs and into a remote little house in the Virginia countryside, two hours away, near the Blue Ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a second emigration. Her commute was punishing; unsettled and lonely, she grew isolated and drank too much. A few years later, she had a profoundly disabling stroke. Little of the person she was remains. Today, she lives in a nursing home, where, strangely, she seems content. Not long after the stroke, I made one last visit to her house, to clear it out before it sold. I took a photo of her vegetable garden, gone to seed—the closest she ever came to living the life she’d pictured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading&quot;&gt;What we could have, should have, or would have done—these kinds of thoughts follow an if-then logic. But we’re also drawn to alternative selves that hover on the edge of sense. Miller recounts how, when the musician Melissa Etheridge and her partner decided to have children, they faced a decision: for their sperm donor, they considered one of two friends, David Crosby or Brad Pitt. They chose Crosby. “My teen-agers now are, like, ‘I could have had Brad Pitt,’ ” Etheridge later said. “ ‘I could’ve been amazingly handsome.’ ” Miller shares a joke recorded by the philosopher Ted Cohen, about a man named Lev: “If I were the Czar, I would be richer than the Czar,” Lev tells a friend. “How could that be?” the friend asks. “Well,” Lev says, “if I were the Czar, on the side I would give Hebrew lessons.” If I’m the Czar, or Brad Pitt’s son, am I still me? The idea that I, myself, could also be someone else seems to exploit a loophole in language. The words make a sentence without making sense. And yet the senselessness of the wish to be someone else may be part of the wish. We want the world to be more porous and lambent than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller quotes the poem “Veracruz,” by George Stanley, in full. It opens by the sea in Mexico, where Stanley is walking on an esplanade. He thinks of how his father once walked on a similar esplanade in Cuba. Step by step, he imagines alternative lives for his father and for himself. What if his dad had moved to San Francisco and “married / not my mother, but her brother, whom he truly loved”? What if his father had transformed himself into a woman, and Stanley had been the child of his father and his uncle? Maybe he would have been born female, and “grown up in San Francisco as a girl, / a tall, serious girl.” If all that had happened, then today, walking by the sea in Mexico, he might be able to meet a sailor, have an affair, and “give birth at last to my son—the boy / I love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Veracruz” reminds me of the people I know who believe in past lives, and of stories like the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/david-lynch&quot;&gt;David Lynch&lt;/a&gt; tells in “Twin Peaks,” in which people seem to step between alternate lives without knowing it. Such stories satisfy us deeply because they reconcile contrary ideas we have about ourselves and our souls. On the one hand, we understand that we could have turned out any number of ways; we know that we aren’t the only possible versions of ourselves. But, on the other, we feel that there is some fundamental light within us—a filament that burns, with its own special character, from birth to death. We want to think that, whoever we might have been, we would have burned with the same light. At the end of “Veracruz,” the poet comes home to the same son. It’s as though my mother became a different kind of person, finding happiness in her garden while she could; and I, having moved to San Francisco, became a coder with a business plan and a head full of algorithms; and still, when our eyes met over Skype, we were us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision seems impossible. As Sartre says, we are who we are. But isn’t the negative space in a portrait part of that portrait? In the sense that our unled lives have been imagined by us, and are part of us, they are real; to know what someone isn’t—what she might have been, what she’s dreamed of being—this is to know someone intimately. When we first meet people, we know them as they are, but, with time, we perceive the auras of possibility that surround them. Miller describes the emotion this experience evokes as “beauty and heartbreak together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel I think of whenever I have this feeling is Virginia Woolf’s “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=to+the+lighthouse&amp;amp;qid=1607967459&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=to+the+lighthouse&amp;amp;qid=1607967459&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;.” Mrs. Ramsay, its central character, is the mother of eight children; the linchpin of her family, she is immersed in the practicalities of her crowded, communal life. Still, even as she attends to the particulars—the morning’s excursion, the evening’s dinner—she senses that they are only placeholders, or handles with which she can grasp something bigger. The details of life seem to her both worthy of attention and somehow arbitrary; the meaning of the whole feels tied up in its elusiveness. One night, she is sitting at dinner, surrounded by her children and her guests. She listens to her husband talking about poetry and philosophy; she watches her children whisper some private joke. (She can’t know that two of them will die: a daughter in childbirth, a son in the First World War.) Then she softens her focus. “She looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black,” Woolf writes, “and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely, as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral.” In this inner quiet, lines of poetry sound:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-embed blockquote-embed--has-paragraph-margin blockquote-embed--has-small-margins&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-embed__content&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be&lt;br/&gt;Are full of trees and changing leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Ramsay isn’t quite sure what these lines mean, and doesn’t know if she invented them, has just heard them, or is remembering them. Still, Woolf writes, “like music, the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice, outside her self, saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things.” We all dwell in the here and now; we all have actual selves, actual lives. But what are they? Selves and lives have penumbras and possibilities—that’s what’s unique about them. They are always changing, and so are always new; they refuse to stand still. We live in anticipation of their meaning, which will inevitably exceed what can be known or said. Much must be left unsaid, unseen, unlived. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Starship / Super Heavy</title>
<link>https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/starship_super_heavy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/starship_super_heavy/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpaceX proposes to conduct Starship/Super Heavy launch operations from the Boca Chica Launch Site in Cameron County, Texas. The proposed operations would include suborbital launches and/or orbital launches. The action would also include the associated actions of tank tests, static fire engine tests, expansion of the vertical launch area (&lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt;) and solar farm, and construction of additional infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boca Chica launch site is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/operations/&quot;&gt;located&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX-owned land in Cameron County, Texas, near the cities of Brownsville and South Padre Island. The launch site consists of the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, which is controlled by the launch and landing control center (&lt;abbr&gt;LLCC&lt;/abbr&gt;). The &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt; is approximately 2.2 miles north of the &lt;abbr&gt;U.S.&lt;/abbr&gt;/Mexico border and the &lt;abbr&gt;LLCC&lt;/abbr&gt; is approximately 1.3 miles north of the &lt;abbr&gt;U.S.&lt;/abbr&gt;/Mexico border. State Highway (&lt;abbr&gt;SH&lt;/abbr&gt;) 4 provides access to the launch site and terminates directly adjacent to the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt;. The &lt;abbr&gt;LLCC&lt;/abbr&gt; consists of a two-story building (referred to as Stargate) and is located west of the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt; along &lt;abbr&gt;SH&lt;/abbr&gt; 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launch Vehicle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fully integrated launch vehicle is comprised of two stages: Super Heavy is the first stage (or booster), and Starship is the second stage. The fully integrated Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle will be approximately 400 feet tall and 30 feet in diameter. Super Heavy will be equipped with up to 37 Raptor engines and Starship will employ up to six Raptor engines. The Raptor engine is powered by liquid oxygen and liquid methane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tank Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to conducting a suborbital launch of a Super Heavy or Starship prototype, SpaceX must conduct tank tests to ensure the tank's reliability. This involves performing pressure tests prior to performing a static fire engine test to confirm the structural integrity of the launch vehicle. During tank tests, SpaceX pressurizes the tank with gaseous media or liquid propellants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pre-flight Operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-flight operations include mission rehearsals and static fire engine tests. The goal of mission rehearsals is to verify that all vehicle and ground systems are functioning properly, as well as to verify that all procedures are properly written. After final systems checkout, SpaceX would conduct a mission rehearsal without propellants on the launch vehicle (referred to as a dry dress rehearsal), followed by a mission rehearsal with propellants on the launch vehicle (referred to as a wet dress rehearsal) to verify full launch readiness. In addition to conducting dress rehearsals, SpaceX would conduct static fire engine tests. The goal of a static fire engine test is to verify engine control and performance. A static fire engine test is identical to a wet dress rehearsal, except engine ignition occurs. During a static fire engine test, the launch vehicle engines are ignited for approximately 15–30 seconds and then shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Launches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is proposing to conduct suborbital and orbital launches. Launches would occur at the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt; and include landings of both stages at the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt; or on a platform (barge) in the Gulf of Mexico no closer than 12 miles off the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX's proposed new launch-related construction activity consists of expanding the solar farm, adding infrastructure and facilities at the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, a liquid natural gas pretreatment system and a liquefier. At the &lt;abbr&gt;VLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, SpaceX is proposing to construct a redundant launch pad and commodities, a redundant landing pad, two integration towers, tank structural test stands, and a desalination plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months have seen a rise in volatility along the Indo-Tibetan border, with the forces of both India and China coming to blows. While these events are extraordinary in present times, the border has witnessed far more heated exchanges, most notably during the 1962 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livehistoryindia.com/in-the-news/2020/06/21/across-the-karakorams&quot;&gt;Indo-China&lt;/a&gt; War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unforgiving terrain that marks the frontier creates an additional dimension to the already complex nature of these clashes, whether in regard to more conventional manoeuvres, or other irregular military activity which is far more frequent. This is the story of the latter kind of action, that of daring espionage against Communist China, played for the highest stakes with the greatest risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-elements story-element-text&quot; id=&quot;inf-card-33d483b8-2c77-4958-ae3b-52863623292b&quot; data-story-element-id=&quot;33d483b8-2c77-4958-ae3b-52863623292b&quot; data-story-element-type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold, harsh, inviolate. Straddling between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livehistoryindia.com/snapshort-histories/2017/06/21/kumaon-echoes-of-the-past&quot;&gt;Kumaon&lt;/a&gt; and Garhwal districts of Uttarakhand, deep in the Himalayas, stands Nanda Devi. The second-highest mountain in India, towering at an astonishing 25,646 feet, it is named after the patron goddess of Uttarakhand— the mountain being her temporal manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its unique topographical environment makes it one of the most inaccessible places on Earth. Surrounded on three sides by massive mountain ramparts—its natural fortifications measuring at no point below 17,000 feet— only the narrow and dangerously steep Rishi Ganga river gorge allows access to it. The mountain in itself is a citadel of rock and ice, with steep, angled faces and avalanche-prone ridges guarding its summit. Its immense proportions make it far tougher to climb than Everest. It is at once a supremely magnificent and terrifyingly intimidating mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the 19th and early 20th century, before it was finally summited in 1936, it was considered to be the third pole – a point of virtual inaccessibility. However, this awe-inspiring creation of nature shelters a device, abhorrent to nature, manufactured by man. Somewhere high on the harrowing slopes of Nanda Devi, buried deep in snow, lies a lost nuclear listening device slowly depleting its plutonium cores. Containing 5kg of plutonium – 1 kg less than the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki – with a predicted lifespan of 900 years, this nuclear trespasser has been forfeited to the mountain forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story behind one of the most audacious acts of espionage in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;story-card-view&quot; data-card-content-id=&quot;5350a04d-7e5b-48a5-9ccc-0c0b06771394&quot; data-card-version-id=&quot;b82a93e5-a227-4175-b91c-b1fe616b5c7c&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold War In High Places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 1965, and the Cold War was reaching its apogee, with America stretching its geopolitical reach to all corners of the world in order to counter the communist influence. Closer to home, the War of ’62 had left India intensely wary of its neighbour, China. To add fuel to simmering embers, China carried out its first nuclear test in 1964 in Xinjiang, a province that borders the northern tip of India. In this atmosphere of intense mutual suspicion and paranoia, the Pentagon began concocting a plan that would help both India and America keep a closer eye on China, especially with regard to its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With satellites that could gather useful photographic intelligence still a few years away, America’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) along with the Indian Intelligence Bureau (IB) planned on placing a powerful listening device at a point of extreme prominence along the Indo-Tibetan border. The site where the device would be placed was key as it would need to have uninterrupted access in order to intercept Chinese radio signals. This meant it would have to be positioned on a mountain that was high as well as close to the Tibetan plateau. With an unparalleled height advantage and an unobstructed view of China from its summit, there was no better choice than Nanda Devi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-elements story-element-text story-element-blurb&quot; id=&quot;inf-card-21631012-ab2e-4940-a233-267421b9382d&quot; data-story-element-id=&quot;21631012-ab2e-4940-a233-267421b9382d&quot; data-story-element-type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;separator-line-burb&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;story-element-blurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure the longevity and endurance of the device, which was supposed to work at an altitude of nearly 26,000 feet, it was decided that it would be nuclear-powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;separator-line-burb&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-elements story-element-text&quot; id=&quot;inf-card-ac913b24-39b9-4cc4-9553-78b1b163d63d&quot; data-story-element-id=&quot;ac913b24-39b9-4cc4-9553-78b1b163d63d&quot; data-story-element-type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) generator was designed so that it would power the telemetry functions of the device, a power unit similar to the ones being used in space at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was within the SNAP that seven plutonium fuel rods would be stored, made from a compound of Pu-238 and Pu-239. Once activated, the SNAP would constantly be converting radioactive heat energy created by the rods into electricity, which would power the multiple-sensor device as well as its six-foot-long antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the technical aspect settled, the question of who would carry and set up all this equipment remained. Only two expeditions had summited the mountain up until then, and more than a few climbers had died. There was no doubt that only the very best mountaineers could be trusted to carry a nuclear payload up one of the most difficult mountains in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 14 American and four Indian mountaineers was assembled. In totality, they represented the cream of a mountaineering generation. Among the Americans, some of the more famous climbers were Dr Robert Schaller, Tom Frost and Jim McCarthy. The Indian contingent consisted of Captain M S Kohli, Sonam Wangyal, H C S Rawat and G S Bhangu. All four had been members of the successful 1965 Indian Everest Expedition, which had put a record nine climbers on the summit. They were in fact enlisted for this covert expedition just a few days after returning from Everest. Together, the entire group was no less than a mountaineering dream team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having sworn their respective oaths of secrecy, the climbing team was flown to Mount McKinley in Alaska, the highest mountain in North America, to prepare for the arduous expedition ahead. While all of them were without doubt among the most experienced climbers at the time, they were rather new to the more idiosyncratic aspect of the expedition – that of dealing with nuclear material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American climber Jim McCarthy was appointed as the designated member of the team who would handle the plutonium rods. Through the summer of 1965, officials from America’s Atomic Energy Commission trained McCarthy to load and unload the device without disturbing its deadly occupant. Other team members were briefed on the dangers of their special load as well, and ways to ensure minimum exposure to the deadly radioactive isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All climbers were going to be paid $1,000 per month, a hefty amount in the 1960s. While there would be personal gratification from having been of service to their respective nations, they were on no account to tell anyone about the nature of their expedition. The cover for the entire team was that they were a joint Indo-American mountaineering team conducting research for high-altitude flight for the American Air Force. Before departing for India, the covert operation was finally given its official codename: Operation Hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the Sanctuary of the Goddess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to attract minimal attention, most of the mountaineers were flown into base camp by helicopter in September 1965. However, the climbing equipment, rations, and of course the listening device itself — stored inside a solid lead casket — were transported in the time-honoured fashion, carried by nearly 150 &lt;em&gt;dotial&lt;/em&gt; porters through the Rishi Ganga gorge. The special load did not go unnoticed among the porters, and apart from its unusual weight, many of them alleged to have felt heat emanating from the casket. Mounted on poles, some climbers later noted its uncanny resemblance to the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in the manner it was transported as well as the supreme power it possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having established themselves at the base of the mountain, the mountaineers methodically began making their way up Nanda Devi. Establishing a series of camps along the climbing route, the team was finally positioned to make an attempt on the summit in the middle of October. It was then that catastrophe struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A violent storm hit the mountain and made it impossible to continue. The summit team, along with the device, was encamped just 2,000 feet below their objective. The extreme conditions, however, greatly endangered their position. Keeping in mind the extreme volatility of such storms, Captain Kohli — the leader of the climbing team — called for an immediate retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;story-card-view&quot; data-card-content-id=&quot;65e7e1e4-a3b0-4ec4-9aaa-c4696502703a&quot; data-card-version-id=&quot;344b6037-e7b7-4181-b199-8bea1745da05&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-elements story-element-text&quot; id=&quot;inf-card-6d7e221c-28e2-4bd3-ac8f-475267b102e9&quot; data-story-element-id=&quot;6d7e221c-28e2-4bd3-ac8f-475267b102e9&quot; data-story-element-type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying the 56 kg listening device in deteriorating weather conditions at 23,000 feet was going to be a Herculean task. Prioritising the need for a quick descent to minimise the risk to the lives of his fellow climbers, Kohli decided to ditch the equipment in the high camp. He reasoned that another expedition could always be mounted when weather conditions improved, in order to retrieve the device. On the other hand, the life of a fellow climber was irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, with all the climbers having safely descended, the expedition came to an end. Being late in the year, the weather window to climb Nanda Devi was now closed. Any new expedition would have to bide their time till the following year. The nuclear device too, abandoned on a high precipice of the mountain, would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of spring in 1966, a second expedition was launched to locate the equipment, and most importantly the nuclear device, that had been left the previous autumn. The composition of the climbing team was more or less the same, and soon they were scouring the slopes of Nanda Devi, trying to find their highly valuable and potentially dangerous belongings. But it was all in vain. Upon reaching their high camp from the previous year, they found their campsite had vanished, and there was a large mass of snow and rock in its place. The nuclear device was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panic-stricken climbers immediately reported this to their CIA and IB handlers, and there was much to and fro between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livehistoryindia.com/tales-of-our-cities/2020/06/29/the-making-of-new-delhi&quot;&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, the Base Camp, and the high camps on the mountain itself, in an attempt to understand where their nuclear device could have vanished. While many believed an avalanche must have swept their camp, more sinister explanations began to be voiced as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of an undercover Pakistani expedition that happened to steal the device to further their own nuclear programme was seen as plausible, although an expedition of such scale not having been noticed by any Indian authority made it highly unlikely. Within the CIA, however, some were suspicious of their Indian counterparts, believing that the Indians had pocketed the device for the development of their own nuclear capability. Regardless of what had actually happened, the device was never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in an act of great persistence, the CIA and IB decided to renew Operation Hat by placing a similar device on the neighbouring mountain of Nanda Kot. Being far shorter than Nanda Devi, it was thought that it would not pose the more complex issues presented by its greater sister peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1967, the team was finally able to place a listening device, along with its SNAP generator, near the summit of the 22,500-foot mountain. The climbers had to dig to form a natural platform, and much care had to be taken during the final positioning of the device. Upon switching it on, a deep hum, heavy vibrations, and a sudden wave of heat confirmed that the nuclear generator had started. Finally, the listening device had been activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nuclear Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after so many trials and tribulations, the device on Nanda Kot did not prove useful for long. After a year of intercepting Chinese radio transmissions, it stopped sending signals back to the CIA station. Another expedition was launched to Nanda Kot, with Captain Kohli leading it as before. When they finally came upon the device, they were startled. Due to the immense heat generated by the SNAP, it had slowly melted into the face of the mountain. By the time the climbers had arrived, it was nearly 8 feet deep and had formed a cove-like structure around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having developed a technical issue and not wanting to risk losing nuclear material on Nanda Kot as well, the SNAP generator along with the rest of the listening device were flown out of the mountain. After having formally ended the operation, the CIA and IB were eager to turn the page, never to revisit the memory of their misadventures in the Himalayas. This was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977 a highly detailed account of the entire operation was published by &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; magazine in America. The author, Howard Kohn, had learnt of the covert operation and had assiduously pieced together the entire undertaking. There was immediate international uproar, especially about the device lost on Nanda Devi. Outcry about it was particularly sharp in India. The then Prime Minister Morarji Desai was grilled from all sides about how such a dangerous predicament could be hidden from the nation, and more pressingly, blatantly ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-elements story-element-text&quot; id=&quot;inf-card-0a6dc981-79c8-49b1-a1b7-c79990587d9d&quot; data-story-element-id=&quot;0a6dc981-79c8-49b1-a1b7-c79990587d9d&quot; data-story-element-type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-container text-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glaciers of Nanda Devi eventually feed into many of the tributaries that later form the Ganga, a river that was at the time a lifeline for more than 200 million people. A few weak rumours notwithstanding, the nuclear device was still somewhere on the slopes of Nanda Devi. If nuclear material from the device was to ever make its way into one of the tributaries, it would be an apocalyptic catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much was promised in the immediate aftermath of the story, there was little done in terms of finding it. The mountain and its surrounding sanctuary were eventually closed off for ‘conservation reasons’. Apart from the occasional military expeditions, Nanda Devi now remains in its primordial state: inviolate and inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-2000s, water and slit samples taken from around Nanda Devi were sent to two different American laboratories. While one laboratory considered the samples to be normal, the other laboratory produced findings that indicated the presence of plutonium similar to that in the SNAP generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings were submitted to the Government of India, but no formal response or action was taken. One can only hope that the device, instead of flowing into the glaciers, has melted its way into the rocky core of the mountain. If so, Nanda Devi is keeping vigil over her devotees, as she has been since time immemorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>An Oscar Winner Made a Khashoggi Documentary. Streaming Services Didn’t Want It</title>

It also won an Oscar for him and for Netflix, which released the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For his second project, he chose another subject with global interest: the killing of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-Mohammed-bin-Salman.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt;, the Saudi Arabian dissident and Washington Post columnist, and the role that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, played in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A film by an Oscar-winning filmmaker would normally garner plenty of attention from streaming services, which have used documentaries and niche movies to attract subscribers and earn awards. Instead, when Mr. Fogel’s film, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/dissident-review-jamal-khashoggi.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The Dissident,”&lt;/a&gt; was finally able to find a distributor after eight months, it was with an independent company that had no streaming platform and a much narrower reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These global media companies are no longer just thinking, ‘How is this going to play for U.S. audiences?’” Mr. Fogel said. “They are asking: ‘What if I put this film out in Egypt? What happens if I release it in China, Russia, Pakistan, India?’ All these factors are coming into play, and it’s getting in the way of stories like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;46.146833503575&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;39.962206332993&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/movies/jamal-khashoggi-kingdom-of-silence-the-dissident.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The Dissident”&lt;/a&gt; will now open in 150 to 200 theaters across the country on Christmas Day and then become available for purchase on premium video-on-demand channels on Jan. 8. (Original plans called for an 800-theater release in October, but those were scaled back because of the pandemic.) Internationally, the film will be released in Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey and other European nations through a network of distributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is a far cry from the potential audience it would have been able to reach through a service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, and Mr. Fogel said he believed it was also a sign of how these platforms — increasingly powerful in the world of documentary film — were in the business of expanding their subscriber bases, not necessarily turning a spotlight on the excesses of the powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For his film, Mr. Fogel interviewed Mr. Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who waited outside the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul in 2018 while the murder took place; The Washington Post’s publisher, Fred Ryan; and multiple members of the Turkish police force. He secured a 37-page transcript made from a recording of what happened in the room where Mr. Khashoggi was suffocated and dismembered. He also spent a significant amount of time with Omar Abdulaziz, a young dissident in exile in Montreal who had worked with Mr. Khashoggi to combat the way the Saudi Arabian government used Twitter to try to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/middleeast/khashoggi-crown-prince-saudi.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;discredit opposing voices&lt;/a&gt; and criticism of the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The Dissident” landed a coveted spot at the Sundance Film Festival in January. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dissident-review-1272803#:~:text=The%20Dissident%20is%20cut%20and,otherwise%20not%20readily%20watch%20a&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt; called it “vigorous, deep and comprehensive,” while &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/the-dissident-review-jamal-khashoggi-1203478959/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Variety said&lt;/a&gt; it was “a documentary thriller of staggering relevance.” Hillary Clinton, who was at Sundance for a documentary about her, urged people to see the film, saying in an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hillary-clinton-talks-jamal-khashoggi-doc-dissident-at-sundance-2020-1273636&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;onstage interview&lt;/a&gt; that it does “a chillingly effective job of demonstrating the swarm that social media can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The only thing left was for Mr. Fogel to secure a sale to a prominent streaming platform, one that could amplify the film’s findings, as Netflix did with “Icarus.” When “Dissident” finally found a distributor in September, it was the independent company Briarcliff Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Fogel said he had made Netflix aware of his film while it was in production and again months later when it was accepted into Sundance. “I expressed to them how excited I was for them to see it,” he said. “I heard nothing back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36.227555555556&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;29.139555555556&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was at the film’s Sundance premiere, but the company did not bid on the film. “While disappointed, I wasn’t shocked,” Mr. Fogel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div role=&quot;complementary&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;storyline-latest-updates&quot; class=&quot;css-y1f5ai&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-8atqhb&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business &amp;amp; Economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-rchdvv&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;time class=&quot;css-101kej7&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-12-23T13:59:03.202Z&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1stvlmo&quot;&gt;Dec. 23, 2020, 8:59 a.m. ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-kpxlkr&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Netflix declined to comment, though a spokeswoman, Emily Feingold, pointed to a handful of political documentaries the service recently produced, including 2019’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/movies/edge-of-democracy-review.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Edge of Democracy,”&lt;/a&gt; about the rise of the authoritarian leader Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon Studios also declined to bid.

PBS has long been a platform for prominent documentaries, but the rise of streaming has made companies like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu very important to the genre. As those companies have grown, their business needs have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.718464351005&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;32.788848263254&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is unquestionably political,” said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s film school. “It’s disappointing, but these are gigantic companies in a death race for survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He added: “You think Disney would do anything different with Disney+?

This year, Magnolia Pictures, which has a streaming deal with Disney-owned Hulu, backed out of a deal with the makers of the documentary “The Assassins,” which tells the story of the poisoning of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The film’s director, Ryan White, referred to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures in an interview with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://variety.com/2020/artisans/awards/sony-hack-ryan-white-assassins-1234853372/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;, and chalked up the “bumpy road” of U.S. distribution to corporations feeling they “could be hacked in a way that could be devastating to them or their bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Netflix was eager to have “Icarus” several years ago, buying the film for $5 million after it debuted at Sundance in 2017. “Fogel’s incredible risk-taking has delivered an absorbing real-life thriller that continues to have global reverberations,” Lisa Nishimura, who was Netflix’s vice president of original documentaries, said in a statement at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Fogel wonders if the company would be as excited about that film now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“When ‘Icarus’ came out, they had 100 million subscribers,” he said. (Netflix currently has 195 million subscribers worldwide.) “And they were in the hunt to get David Fincher to do movies with them, to get Martin Scorsese to do movies with them, to get Alfonso Cuarón to do movies with them. That’s why it was so important that they had a film they could win an award with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In January 2019, Netflix pulled an episode of the comedian Hasan Minhaj’s series, “Patriot Act,” when he criticized Prince Mohammed after Mr. Khashoggi’s death.

<title>Fun with IP address parsing</title>
<link>https://blog.dave.tf/post/ip-addr-parsing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.dave.tf/post/ip-addr-parsing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Written by&lt;/span&gt; David Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-12-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC&quot;&gt;December 25, 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my quest to write a fast IPv4+6 parser, I wrote a slow-but-I-think-correct parser, to use as a base of comparison. In doing so, I discovered more cursed IP address representations that I was previously unaware of. Let’s explore together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start out simple, with IPv4 and IPv6 in what I’ll call their “canonical form”: &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8&lt;/code&gt;. Various specs call these “dotted quad” (more specifically, “dotted decimal”), dot-separated fields each representing 1 byte; and “colon-hex”, colon-separated fields each representing 2 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bits of complexity come from IPv6. In canonical form, common addresses would end up with long runs of zeros in the middle. So, &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; allows you to elide 1 or more 16-bit blocks of zeros: &lt;code&gt;1:2::3:4&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;1:2:0:0:0:0:3:4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, for cursed historical reasons, IPv6 permits you to write the final 32 bits of the address in dotted quad form. Effectively, you can splat an IPv4 address onto the end of IPv6 addresses! &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:4:5:6:77.77.88.88&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:4:5:6:4d4d:5858&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you can combine the two! &lt;code&gt;fe80::1.2.3.4&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;fe80:0:0:0:0:0:102:304&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; introduces an annoying edge case in parsing: the &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; can be at the start or end of the address, and the “empty” side of the address is not one of the 16-bit fields. &lt;code&gt;::1&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1::&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0&lt;/code&gt;. This is a natural consequence of the &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; rule, but it makes the parser slightly more annoying to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final rule for IPv6: technically, each colon-hex field is 4 hex digits, but you can elide leading zeros, as I’ve been doing so far. Fully canonically, &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000&lt;/code&gt;. My apologies to trypophobic readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for IPv6, mostly. Now, on to IPv4!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact, the textual representation of IPv4 was never standardized in any document before IPv6 needed a grammar for its weirdo “trailing dotted quad” notation. So, it’s a de-facto standard that boils down to mostly “what did 4.2BSD understand?”, and “what did other OSes keep when they copied 4.2BSD?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hoo boy, strap yourselves in, because 4.2BSD sure had some whacky opinions! Let’s use &lt;code&gt;192.168.140.255&lt;/code&gt; as an example. That’s an IPv4 address that people would look at and go “yes, that sure is an IPv4 address.” How else can we write that exact same address?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same IP address: &lt;code&gt;3232271615&lt;/code&gt;. You get that by interpreting the 4 bytes of the IP address as a big-endian unsigned 32-bit integer, and print that. This leads to a classic parlor trick: if you try to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://3232271615&quot;&gt;http://3232271615&lt;/a&gt; , Chrome will load &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.140.255&quot;&gt;http://192.168.140.255&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but that’s sort-of sensible, right? An IPv4 address is 4 bytes, so printing it as a single number is a bit human-unfriendly, but broadly plausible, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about &lt;code&gt;0300.0250.0214.0377&lt;/code&gt; ? That’s still the same address. Dotted quad, except each field is written out in octal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if octal is supported, you might be wondering about hex. And you’d be right! &lt;code&gt;192.168.140.255&lt;/code&gt; is also &lt;code&gt;0xc0.0xa8.0x8c.0xff&lt;/code&gt;, according to 4.2BSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, remember before we had CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ? IPv4 addresses were Class A, Class B or Class C. It was a weird time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that weird time made it into IP addresses! The familiar &lt;code&gt;192.168.140.255&lt;/code&gt; notation is technically the “Class C” notation. You can also write that address in “class B” notation as &lt;code&gt;192.168.36095&lt;/code&gt;, or in “Class A” notation as &lt;code&gt;192.11046143&lt;/code&gt;. What we’re doing is coalescing the final bytes of the address into either a 16-bit or a 24-bit integer field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, by the way, is why utilities like &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; will accept weird looking addresses like &lt;code&gt;127.1&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike IPv6, it’s not doing some kind of “missing fields are zero” expansion. &lt;code&gt;127.1&lt;/code&gt; is the Class A notation for “host 1 of network 127”, where the 1 is a 24-bit number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we come to one last bit of unspecified behavior: do IPv4 addresses permit an unlimited number of leading zeros in each quad? Or is there a maximum of 3 digits? &lt;code&gt;001.002.003.004&lt;/code&gt; is universally recognized as valid. What about &lt;code&gt;0000000001.0000000002.0000000003.000000004&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also be wondering if either of these numbers should be read in as octal, since we said earlier that a leading zero might be interpreted as octal. It depends! There are implementations that do both, but &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; modern implementations have abandoned the octal and hex notation, and treat leading 0s as decimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading zero debate also infects IPv6, to some extent. Is &lt;code&gt;000001::00001.00002.00003.00004&lt;/code&gt; is a valid IPv6 address (“common” form &lt;code&gt;1::1.2.3.4&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;1::102:304&lt;/code&gt;)? Most modern parsers seem to allow an unlimited amount of leading zeros in their representations, probably because they’re leaning on some “parse integer” library that implements that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we reach the bitter end. If you want to &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; parse IP addresses, this is the bullshit you have to put up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, my slow reference parser jettisons a lot of old baggage, and sticks to what I think is a sensible subset of these possibilities. It understands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Classic v4 dotted decimal, with any number of leading zeros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not process Class A/B notation, or hex or octal notation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not process the “uint32 to the knee” representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For IPv6, it understands canonical colon-hex form, as well as :: and trailing-IPv4 style (where the trailing IPv4 follows the same rules as the previous tweet). Each field is allowed any number of leading zeros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m on the fence about that last one, the “IPv6 with an embedded dotted decimal” form. My reference parser (Go’s &lt;code&gt;net.ParseIP&lt;/code&gt;) understands it, but it’s not really that useful any more in the real world. At the dawn of IPv6, the idea was that you could upgrade an address to IPv6 by prepending a pair of colons, as in &lt;code&gt;::1.2.3.4&lt;/code&gt;, but modern transition mechanisms no longer offer anything as clear-cut as this, so the notation doesn’t really show up in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
