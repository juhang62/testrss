<title>GNU Recutils</title>

<description>&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://labs.tomasino.org/assets/images/gnu-recutils.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fred and George, Turtles in love&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred and George, Turtles in love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of cool command line tools that have been made over the years built on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy&quot;&gt;unix philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Plain text is powerful, ubiquitous, and human-centric. It was also the only option for computing for quite a while. It’s no surprise that some of the most sophisticated tools are focused on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such package is GNU Recutils, a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable, plain text databases called recfiles. Using plain text that is &lt;strong&gt;primarily&lt;/strong&gt; human-readable as a database is just frankly cool as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recutils is a collection of tools, like &lt;code&gt;recins&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;recdel&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;recsel&lt;/code&gt; used to manage these recfiles/databases. They allow for all the normal basic relational database operations, typing, auto-incrementing, and even field-level crypto. All of this power is yours with the bonus that your database is a human-readable text file that you can grep/awk/sed freely, and a line-oriented structure makes it perfect for version control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recfiles&quot;&gt;Recfiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recfile begins with an optional structure definition using &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; prefixes. There’s a lot of power available in this, including the defining of relations between tables, constraints, types, and more. You can use the built-in type definitions or define your own using regular expressions (plain text woo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this header bit, the individual records are listed with a blank line separating entries. Have a look at how amazingly readable the data is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a more sophisticated example that shows a relationship in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;queries-other-operations&quot;&gt;Queries &amp;amp; other operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ recsel -e &lt;span&gt;&quot;Location = 'loaned'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -P Title books.rec
The Colour of Magic&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Querying your recfile database is usually done with &lt;code&gt;recsel&lt;/code&gt; (recfile select). You specify the table to query, expressions, fields to return, and the file and the output comes to standard out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To insert data you use the &lt;code&gt;recins&lt;/code&gt; (recfile insert) command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ recins -t Task              &lt;span&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;    -f Id -v &lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;    -f Title  -v &lt;span&gt;&quot;New issue.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;    -f Status -v NEW          &lt;span&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;    TODO.rec&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again it’s a simple syntax. You provide the table to insert into, a list of fields &amp;amp; values (-f &amp;amp; -v, respectively), and the filename. If you prefer, you can use the &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; switch to provide the field &amp;amp; value as one string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about deleting records? Can you guess the syntax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ recdel -c -t Task -e &lt;span&gt;&quot;Status = 'CLOSED'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; TODO.rec&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, it’s pretty much the same as the select, as one would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-else&quot;&gt;What else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s other convenient tools, like the ability to convert to and from CSV formats, alternative output modes that make it work well with awk, password-protected fields, and so on. The package is quite robust and well maintained by Jose E. Marchesi, who can be found in the #recutils room on irc.freenode.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/manual/&quot;&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt; is seriously impressive. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be adopting it into my tools immediately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(yes, the offical package image is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/faq.html#whyturtles&quot;&gt;two gay turtles&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Access to Wikipedia restored in Turkey after more than two and a half years</title>
<link>https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2020/01/15/access-to-wikipedia-restored-in-turkey-after-more-than-two-and-a-half-years/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2020/01/15/access-to-wikipedia-restored-in-turkey-after-more-than-two-and-a-half-years/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, on Wikipedia’s 19th birthday, the Wikimedia Foundation has received reports that access to Wikipedia in Turkey is actively being restored.* This latest development follows a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2019/12/26/turkish-constitutional-court-rules-that-the-two-and-a-half-year-block-of-wikipedia-is-unconstitutional/&quot;&gt;26 December 2019 ruling&lt;/a&gt; by the Constitutional Court of Turkey that the more than two and a half year block imposed by the Turkish government was unconstitutional. Earlier today, the Turkish Constitutional Court made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anayasa.gov.tr/media/6426/2017-22355.pdf&quot;&gt;full text of that ruling&lt;/a&gt; available to the public, and shortly after, we received reports that access was restored to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled that the people of Turkey will once again be able to participate in the largest global conversation about the culture and history of Turkey online and continue to make Wikipedia a vibrant source of information about Turkey and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to be reunited with the people of Turkey,” said Katherine Maher, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation. “At Wikimedia we are committed to protecting everyone’s fundamental right to access information. We are excited to share this important moment with our Turkish contributor community on behalf of knowledge-seekers everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are actively reviewing the full text of the ruling by the Constitutional Court of Turkey. In the meantime, our case before the European Court of Human Rights is still being considered by the Court. We filed a petition in the European Court of Human Rights in spring of last year, and in July, the Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2019/07/22/european-court-of-human-rights-has-decided-to-expedite-case-on-online-censorship-brought-against-the-government-of-turkey-for-blocking-wikipedia/&quot;&gt;granted our case priority status&lt;/a&gt;. We will continue to advocate for strong protections for free expression online in Turkey and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is a global free knowledge resource written and edited by people around the world. Because of this open editing model, Wikipedia is also a resource everyone can be a part of actively shaping  — adding knowledge about their culture, country, interests, studies, and more through Wikipedia’s articles. Volunteers work together to write articles about many different topics ranging from history, pop culture, science, sports, and more using reliable sources to verify the facts. It is through this collective process of writing, discussion, and debate that Wikipedia becomes more neutral, more comprehensive, and more representative of the world’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 85 percent of the articles on Wikipedia are in languages other than English, which includes the Turkish Wikipedia’s more than 335,000 articles, written by Turkish-speaking volunteers for Turkish-speaking people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time that the block was in effect, we heard from students, teachers, professionals and more in Turkey about how the block had impacted their daily lives. For many students, the block had occurred &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html&quot;&gt;just days before their final exams&lt;/a&gt;. On social media, members of the international volunteer Wikipedia editor community and countless individuals &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/02/we-miss-turkey/&quot;&gt;shared messages of support with #WeMissTurkey&lt;/a&gt; and their desire to once again collaborate with the people of Turkey on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the decision today, our editors in Turkey will once again be able to fully participate in sharing and contributing to free knowledge online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* We have received reports that several internet service providers in Turkey, depending on the location, have restored access to Wikipedia in Turkey, with some still in the process of restoring access. We will keep this statement updated as further access is restored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The economics of all-you-can-eat buffets</title>
<link>https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-all-you-can-eat-buffets/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-all-you-can-eat-buffets/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Few things epitomize America more than the all-you-can-eat buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small fee, you’re granted unencumbered access to a wonderland of gluttony. It is a place where saucy meatballs and egg rolls share the same plate without prejudice, where a tub of chocolate pudding finds a home on the salad bar, where variety and quantity reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The buffet is a celebration of excess,” says Chef Matthew Britt, an assistant professor at the Johnson &amp;amp; Wales College of Culinary Arts. “It exists for those who want it all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one has to wonder: How does an industry that &lt;em&gt;encourages&lt;/em&gt; its customers to maximize consumption stay in business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, we spoke with industry experts, chefs, and buffet owners. As it turns out, it’s harder to “beat” the buffet than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a $20 buffet breaks down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to an all-you-can-eat buffet, you pay a single &lt;strong&gt;fixed price&lt;/strong&gt; regardless of how much you consume. It doesn’t matter if you eat 1 plate or 10 plates: Each bite incurs an extra marginal cost to the restaurant, but no extra cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the prices of 30 all-you-can-eat buffets across the country, taking into account a variety of factors: Geographic region, size of the buffet (independent vs. chain), time of day (lunch vs. dinner), day of the week (weekday vs. weekend), and age (children and seniors often get discounted rates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All considered, our analysis yielded an average buffet price of ~&lt;strong&gt;$20&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most restaurants, buffets operate on extremely thin margins: For every $20 in revenue, $19 might go toward overhead, leaving &lt;strong&gt;$1 (5%) in net profit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cost-breakdown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17975&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;412&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary Crockett / The Hustle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffets often break even on food and eke out a profit by &lt;strong&gt;minimizing the cost of labor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-service allows a buffet to bypass a wait staff, and all-you-can-eat dishes (which are generally less complex and prepped in enormous batches) can be made by a “skeleton crew” of line cooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a typical restaurant, a cook can service 25 customers per hour — and that’s at best,” says Joe Ericsson, a managing partner at the food consultancy &lt;a href=&quot;http://restaurantowner.com&quot;&gt;Restaurant Owner&lt;/a&gt;. “In the same amount of time, a single buffet cook might be able to prep enough food for 200 people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because margins are so slim, buffets rely on &lt;strong&gt;high foot traffic&lt;/strong&gt;: At Golden Corral, a buffet chain with 498 locations in 42 states, dining floors are 5k-square-feet and seat 475 people. On a typical Saturday, it’s not uncommon for 900 diners to come through the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;volume of food&lt;/strong&gt; required to satiate 900 all-you-can-eaters on a daily basis can be staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, Ovation Brands, the owner of multiple major buffet chains, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/the-economists-who-studied-all-you-can-eat-buffets/384033/&quot;&gt;serves up&lt;/a&gt; 85m dinner rolls, 47m pounds of chicken, and 6m pounds of steak — 49.3B calories in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/the-economists-who-studied-all-you-can-eat-buffets/384033/&quot;&gt;5% and 25%&lt;/a&gt; of any given dish will be wasted, either through the buffet’s miscalculation of demand or the diner’s overzealousness. &lt;strong&gt;Waste reduction&lt;/strong&gt; is a key focus of any successful buffet and a frequent tactic is reusing food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Buffets have always been a landing spot for food scraps,” says Chef Britt. “They call them the ‘trickle-down specials’ — day-old vegetables or beef trimmings can be repurposed into a soup or a hash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffets are also able to save money by utilizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;economies of scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and buying food in bulk. Using data from a wholesale food supplier, we worked out the approximate cost per serving of a few popular buffet items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cost-items.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17976&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;420&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary Crockett / The Hustle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully prepped, starches like potatoes might only cost the restaurant $0.30 per serving, compared to $2.25 per serving for steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nature, buffets attract the very customers they wish to avoid: Big eaters with insatiable appetites. Buffets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/201510/how-all-you-can-eat-buffets-use-psychology-make-money&quot;&gt;seek to&lt;/a&gt; “fill the customer’s belly as cheaply and as quickly as possible.” To do so, they employ a number of research-backed tricks to get people to eat less food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They put the cheap, filling stuff at the front of the buffet line&lt;/strong&gt;: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077055%20https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-restaurants-love-buffets-even-more-than-do.htm&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;: 75% of buffet customers select whatever food is in the first tray — and 66% of all the food they consume comes from the first 3 trays.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They use smaller plates&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(12)00938-5/abstract&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;: Smaller plate sizes reduce the amount of food consumed.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They use larger than average serving spoons&lt;/strong&gt; for things like potatoes, and smaller than average tongs for meats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They frequently refill water&lt;/strong&gt; and use extra-large glasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even higher-end buffets, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hoteldel.com/restaurant-coronado/crown-room/&quot;&gt;$98 brunch&lt;/a&gt; at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, employ these tactics: “They hide the truffles, the foie gras, and the oysters,” says Britt. “You literally can’t find them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when a customer ignores these tricks and devours a Godzilla-sized portion of food? Is it possible to — dare we ask — &lt;em&gt;out-eat&lt;/em&gt; the all-you-can-eat buffet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffets and the law of averages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine that Larry, a 280-pound offensive lineman, decides to stop by his local all-you-can-eat buffet after a big game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry’s got a reputation around town for being a gourmand. He’s got an appetite that puts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=257&amp;amp;v=E2dmfnSarDI&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot;&gt;Homer Simpson&lt;/a&gt; to shame — and on this particular day, he’s ready to do some serious damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lineman2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17977&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;359&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary Crockett / The Hustle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry pays his $20 and proceeds to eat 5 servings of steak and chicken, far more than the average customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of this food to the buffet amounts to $16.90. This means that after factoring in other expenses, Larry has handed the restaurant a loss of &lt;strong&gt;-$8.50&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, eaters like Larry (“vacuum cleaners,” as one buffet owner calls them) are baked into any all-you-can-eat buffet’s pricing model. While the buffet might lose money on a small number of meat gluttons, it handily makes it back on those who &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt;-consume or only eat the cheaper foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people don’t go in and beat the buffet,” says Britt. “They eat an appropriate amount, or even less than they should, averaging out the outliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture 3 diners: One who eats exactly the average cost of food to the restaurant ($7.40), one who loads up on cheaper carbs ($4.70), and a guy like Larry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the restaurant loses $8.50 on Larry, it makes $3.70 from the under-eater and still takes in its steady $1 margin on the average eater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are a lot more of the latter two patrons: The buffet owners we spoke with estimated that over-eaters like Larry only account for &lt;strong&gt;1 in every ~20 diners&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 300 diners that might come through on a given day, this hypothetical buffet would see 75 average eaters ($225 profit), 20 undereaters ($222), and 15 gluttons (-$128). That works out to $320, or right around that $1 profit per customer average. Annualized, the eatery is looking at a respectable $117k in pre-tax profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffets don’t stop there: Many beef up their margins by selling &lt;strong&gt;soft drinks&lt;/strong&gt; separately. At a cost of $0.12 per fill, a $2 soda comes with a 1,500% markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, buffets aren’t impervious to &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; circumstances. Larry won’t put a significant dent in a buffet’s bottom line — but imagine if he brought the rest of his team with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17979&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;359&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary Crockett / The Hustle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every buffet owner we talked to had a few war stories about dealing with policy abusers. “All-you-can-eat,” it seems, comes with certain limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are people who go to a buffet and eat for 3 or 4 hours straight,” says Anna Hebal, owner of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://redapple.restaurant/&quot;&gt;Red Apple Buffet&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago. “They’ll go to the bathroom, then come back and eat again. They don’t stop.” She has since imposed a 2-hour time limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other proprietors have taken more extreme measures. Over the years, buffets have made headlines for &lt;strong&gt;kicking out guests who eat too much&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 6’6″, 350-pound Wisconsin man was removed from a buffet after downing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2012/5/15/6586551/man-denied-all-you-can-eat-fish-arrested-for-picketing&quot;&gt;12 fried fish fillets&lt;/a&gt; (and subsequently arrested for protesting outside).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A German triathlete was asked to prematurely leave an $18.95 buffet after consuming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/09/18/man-who-ate-plates-sushi-banned-all-you-can-eat-buffet/#comments-wrapper&quot;&gt;100 plates&lt;/a&gt; of sushi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman was booted from a Golden Corral for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/526676137/?terms=kicked%2Bout%2Bof%2Bbuffet&quot;&gt;eating all the brownies&lt;/a&gt;, then attempting to smuggle home extras in her purse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid these situations, some owners have updated their language to “All-you-can-eat &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mel-magazine/the-hidden-limits-of-the-all-you-can-eat-buffet-9de49556de6&quot;&gt;within reason&lt;/a&gt;,” or resorted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.de/20160816/eat-up-or-pay-up-why-guests-are-charged-for-leftovers&quot;&gt;charging customers extra&lt;/a&gt; for food left on plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real enemy of the buffet isn’t the occasional over-eater: It’s the steady march of technological progress, and the changing consumer preferences that have come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end of the (buffet) line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the market research firm NPD Group, the number of buffets in America has fallen by 26% since 1998 — even as the total number of all restaurants in America has risen by 22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 20 years, more than 1.3k buffets have shut their doors. The big buffet chains that once dotted the Midwest have been hit the hardest: Old Country Buffet is down to 17 of its 350 original locations; HomeTown Buffet has closed 217 of its 250 eateries; Ryan’s Buffet has downsized from 400 to 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovation Brands, the conglomerate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/how-golden-corral-bucking-buffet-collapse&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; these chains, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 3 times since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17980&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;362&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary Crockett / The Hustle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts attribute this decline, in part, to the spread of food delivery apps. By 2030, the National Restaurant Association projects that 80% of all restaurant items will be eaten at home — a trend that buffets can’t effectively capitalize on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s health-conscious consumers have also shifted away from quantity in favor of experience-driven dining options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden Corral, one of the last-standing American buffet chains, has found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/how-golden-corral-bucking-buffet-collapse&quot;&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; by redesigning its dining spaces to be more “bright, shiny, [and] friendly,” and investing in higher-quality food that makes for better Instagram photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Hebal, who runs a small buffet in Chicago, has a different strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 30 years, she has served guests a Polish-themed spread that includes kielbasa, schnitzel, and pierogi. Her secret? Sticking to the roots of what first made buffets popular in the 1970s: excess and variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A buffet is just like life itself; you have so many choices,” she says. “It’s up to you to choose wisely.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In 2019, Americans went more to the library than to the movies on average</title>

&lt;h4&gt;Story Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Library most frequented by young adults, women and low-income households&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average U.S. adult attended five movies and five live sporting events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age and income among key factors in frequency of activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Visiting the library remains the most common cultural activity Americans engage in, by far. The average 10.5 trips to the library U.S. adults report taking in 2019 exceeds their participation in eight other common leisure activities. Americans attend live music or theatrical events and visit national or historic parks roughly four times a year on average and visit museums and gambling casinos 2.5 times annually. Trips to amusement or theme parks (1.5) and zoos (.9) are the least common activities among this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans' Reports of Leisure and Activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About how many times in the past year, if any, did you do each of the following? How about -- [RANDOM ORDER]?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data -- collected in a Dec. 2-15, 2019 Gallup poll -- are an update from a December 2001 survey. Though the overall rankings at the beginning of the millennium remain the same today, a small decrease has occurred in reported trips to the movie theater (down 1.3 average visits). Meanwhile, small increases have taken place in average reports of visiting a museum (up 0.7 average visits), attending a live music or theatrical event (up 1.1 average visits) and visits to a national or historical park (up 1.3 average visits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women Visit Libraries Nearly Twice as Frequently as Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men and woman report doing most activities at about the same rate, but there are a few key differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women report visiting the library nearly twice as frequently as men do, 13.4 to 7.5 visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are more likely than women to visit casinos, attend sporting events and visit national or historical parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 30-49 Age Group Most Active Across Most Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across nearly all measures, the highest average activity rates are among the 30 to 49 age group, while the lowest are among those 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 to 49 age group's higher activity may reflect their relative youth combined with mid-life financial stability. Middle-aged adults' activity is particularly above-par in terms of attending live sporting events. Their average attendance of 7.4 events during the year is more than twice that of younger adults and exceeds older adults by more than three visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two exceptions to the pattern of middle-aged adults being the most active are visits to libraries and casinos. U.S. adults aged 18 to 29 visit the library much more than all older age groups -- possibly reflecting college-going adults, who visit the library for studies. This youngest age group also visits casinos the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Income Households Generally Do More Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Americans in high-income households report doing activities the most, while Americans in low-income households participate the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widest gaps between high- and low-income households are in reports of attending a live sporting event, a live music or theatrical event, a museum, and going to the movie theater -- all things often associated with significant ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the library -- which is free and offers a variety of services including WiFi -- is visited most by adults in low-income households and least by adults in high-income households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having smaller incomes, Americans in low-income households visit gambling casinos with slightly greater frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the three income groups are about as likely to attend an amusement or theme park as well as the zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain Activities More Frequented Among Households With Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most measures, there are not meaningful differences between adults who report having children under the age of 18 in their households versus adults who do not have children living in their homes. But for a few activities, there are some differences between the two groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with children in their household attend live sporting events and go to the movies about two times or more than adults who do not have children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, adults who have no children in their household attend live music or theatrical events slightly more frequently than adults who have children in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;source&quot; colspan=&quot;100&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the proliferation of digital-based activities over the past two decades -- including digital books, podcasts, streaming entertainment services and advanced gaming -- libraries have endured as a place Americans visit nearly monthly on average. Whether because they offer services like free Wi-Fi, movie rentals, or activities for children, libraries are most utilized by young adults, women and residents of low-income households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities that typically cost money are visited or attended less frequently. Among this group of activities, outings to movie theaters and sports events remain the trips Americans make the most, while zoos are the least frequented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many factors determine how Americans spend their free time, and financial means is a key factor. Age, too, is a large determinant. While middle-aged Americans may tend to be the most active in these activities due to their relative youth and greater financial stability, the 30 to 49 age cohort's activeness may also reflect its household makeup. The average age of a first-time mother in the U.S. is 26 and 31 for a first-time father, according to 2016 data from the National Center for Health Statistics. So, the need to keep growing children entertained through trips to the movies or to sporting events -- which are more popular among households with children -- may be more common among this age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one's personal interests also factor into such decisions, which may bear out in activities showing significant gender differences, such as a women's book club at the local library, or activities that are more popular or available in certain parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SQLite Is Serverless</title>
<link>https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;nosearch&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite Is Serverless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most SQL database engines are implemented as a separate server process. Programs that want to access the database communicate with the server using some kind of interprocess communication (typically TCP/IP) to send requests to the server and to receive back results. SQLite does not work this way. With SQLite, the process that wants to access the database reads and writes directly from the database files on disk. There is no intermediary server process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are advantages and disadvantages to being serverless. The main advantage is that there is no separate server process to install, setup, configure, initialize, manage, and troubleshoot. This is one reason why SQLite is a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/zeroconf.html&quot;&gt;zero-configuration&lt;/a&gt;&quot; database engine. Programs that use SQLite require no administrative support for setting up the database engine before they are run. Any program that is able to access the disk is able to use an SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a database engine that uses a server can provide better protection from bugs in the client application - stray pointers in a client cannot corrupt memory on the server. And because a server is a single persistent process, it is able to control database access with more precision, allowing for finer-grained locking and better concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most SQL database engines are client/server based. Of those that are serverless, SQLite is the only one known to this author that allows multiple applications to access the same database at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This section was added on 2018-04-02)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, folks have begun to use the word &quot;serverless&quot; to mean something subtly different from its intended meaning in this document. Here are two possible definitions of &quot;serverless&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic Serverless:&lt;/strong&gt; The database engine runs within the same process, thread, and address space as the application. There is no message passing or network activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo-Serverless:&lt;/strong&gt; The database engine runs in a separate namespace from the application, probably on a separate machine, but the database is provided as a turn-key service by the hosting provider, requires no management or administration by the application owners, and is so easy to use that the developers can think of the database as being serverless even if it really does use a server under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQLite is an example of a classic serverless database engine. With SQLite, there are no other processes, threads, machines, or other mechanisms (apart from host computer OS and filesystem) to help provide database services or implementation. There really is no server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless-computing-database&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure Cosmo DB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; are examples of a neo-serverless databases. These database are implemented by server processes running separately in the cloud. But the servers are maintained and administered by the ISP, not by the application developer. Application developers just use the service. Developers do not have to provision, configure, or manage database server instances, as all of that work is handled automatically by the service provider. Database servers do in fact exist, they are just hidden from the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand these two different definitions for &quot;serverless&quot;. When a database claims to be &quot;serverless&quot;, be sure to discern whether they mean &quot;classic serverless&quot; or &quot;neo-serverless&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>South American nations open fire on ICANN for &amp;#039;illegal&amp;#039; sale of .amazon</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/21/amazonb_icann_spat/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/21/amazonb_icann_spat/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Eight South American governments have vowed to make life difficult for DNS overseer ICANN after it gave the .amazon top-level domain to the US tech giant headed by Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2020/01/20/acto-icann-amazon.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] sent on Friday, the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) responded badly to a missive from ICANN’s president saying it was going ahead with adding the address to the global internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling the decision “illegal and unjust,” as well as an “act of force,” it criticizes ICANN’s “attempts to legitimize a decision that was not taken under legitimate circumstances nor for legitimate reasons,” and vows vague revenge by “disseminating news of this situation to all relevant groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That angry response is one that ICANN has gone out of its way trying to avoid but, ironically, ended up inviting due to its attempts to drag out the process. It has been eight years since Amazon applied for its namesake generic top-level domain (gTLD) and, initially, the application passed all the checks and was approved, as were more than a thousand others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following revelations from Edward Snowden about mass surveillance by the US government, which included tapping the mobile phone of the-then president of Brazil, the Brazilian government started raising objections and was joined by other South American legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those governments used an inter-governmental process to formally object to .amazon and ICANN responded by putting the application in legal limbo, presumably in the hope that Amazon would walk away. But they had reckoned without the online giant’s determination and, after spending years and millions of dollars going through ICANN’s review process, the tech giant &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/19/dot_amazon_icann/&quot;&gt;emerged triumphant&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Board failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Amazon won the independent review for the simple fact that neither ICANN nor the governments had actually stated their reasons for rejecting the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The board failed in its duty to explain and give adequate reasons for its decision,” the decision read, adding that “an explanation... for denying the applications was particularly important in this matter, given the absence of any rationale or reasons provided by the GAC for its advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stated that it was &quot;unable to discern a well-founded public policy reason&quot; for turning the application down and revealed that ICANN had not even discussed, let alone relied on, the conclusions of an independent expert who had been hired to dig into the issue and who also concluded there was no reason to deny it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being told its actions were unjustified and it should approve the .amazon application, ICANN did not reverse its position however. Brazil made it clear it remained unhappy and tried to get ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) to continue opposing the introduction of .amazon. Meanwhile Amazon wrote an angry letter insisting that ICANN follow the results of its own independent review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, in an effort to avoid taking a decision, ICANN’s board approved a resolution that required ACTO and Amazon to resolve the issue themselves and report back to ICANN with a solution. Despite Amazon making a variety of offers, including &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/25/amazon_domain_kindles/&quot;&gt;$5m of free Kindles and AWS credits&lt;/a&gt;, the two sides were unable to reach agreement and a year later ICANN was put under pressure to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It responded again by avoiding confrontation and passed another series of resolutions that were aimed at pushing the two sides together. That process also inevitably failed. ICANN’s Board then directed its CEO to oversee the process - but he was unable to even arrange a meeting with the governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year passed and it became clear to many that the governments’ strategy was to rely on ICANN’s unwillingness to make a decision to drag out the process indefinitely. Behind the scenes, ICANN board members had accepted the recommendation of its legal department not to confront the governments, but had put in place a series of deadlines to ensure that there was some kind of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not very appealing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with a Board decision, the South American governments delayed action again by appealing through ICANN’s review processes. When that was completed and there was still no justification for stopping .amazon, ICANN finally announced that the issue was at an end and it would approve .amazon's sale to Amazon at its March 2019 meeting in Japan, seven years after the initial application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yet again ICANN shrank from a belligerent ACTO that claimed that any such decision would be illegitimate, with the business' CEO Goran Marby sending an apologetic letter to the organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me assure you that the Board and I consider this recent turn of events to be truly unfortunate,&quot; he groveled. &quot;We sincerely hope that we can put any misunderstanding between ACTO and ourselves behind us and move forward together in a constructive and positive manner that enables all parties to come to a mutually agreeable solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTO insisted on a face-to-face meeting and Marby duly got on a plane to Brasilia. He was in his hotel room in Brazil’s capital when he was told the meeting had been cancelled due to the political situation in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than approve .amazon at its March meeting however, ICANN’s board decided - for a third time - that the best solution was to get the two sides to reach agreement themselves and gave &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/12/amazon_domain_spat/&quot;&gt;yet another deadline&lt;/a&gt; to come up with an agreement. A deadline that was, of course, missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month after that deadline, ICANN’s board finally moved forward, albeit in a decision &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/21/bezos_finally_gets_amazon/&quot;&gt;couched in legalese&lt;/a&gt; and yet more process: Amazon would publish “Public Interest Commitments (PICs)” that it said would address the governments’ concerns and put them out for public comment, ICANN said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those PICs were published months later but ICANN went out of its way to make sure they weren’t noticed: it published them on a sub-site that requires people to register to access information, instead of using its normal public comment process, and it made no public announcement about the publication, despite promising to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If in doubt, do it in secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This secretive approach worked in one respect; there were only four comments when the comment deadline passed. This only served to infuriate the ACTO governments who felt, with some justification, that ICANN was trying to avoid scrutiny. The approach also worried observers who again saw ICANN making up new processes on the fly in an effort to skirt obligations rather than do its job properly and in full public view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it took none other than the US government to bail ICANN out of years of indecision. At an ICANN meeting in November, during which the Brazilian government asked the world’s governments to oppose the addition of .amazon to the internet and insist that ICANN require ACTO and Amazon to have a fourth round of negotiations to reach a “mutually acceptable solution,” the US government said it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/04/amazon_domain_name/&quot;&gt;had had enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The United States does not support further intervention that effectively works to prevent or delay the delegation of .amazon and and we do not believe that it is required,” its representative told the meeting in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing was heard from ICANN for a month until its CEO sent ACTO a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/marby-to-moreira-17dec19-en.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] on December 17 that thanked it for its “continuous participation in the discussions related to the delegation of the .amazon top level domains” but noted that “ICANN and Amazon Corporation will shortly sign the agreements related to the delegation of .amazon top level domains as part of the next steps toward delegation of these top level domains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, Marby published a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/news/blog/status-update-on-amazon-applications-the-next-steps&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; noting the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, on Friday, in what may be the final piece of correspondence over the eight-year battle over .amazon, ACTO sent its response in which it called the decision to finally approve the top-level domain “illegal and unjust” and one that “was not taken under legitimate circumstances nor for legitimate reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not known exactly when the .amazon name will appear on the global root zone file but based on the addition of hundreds of other TLDs over the past five years, it will be as soon as this month if Amazon indicates it wants to move forward and is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/01/18/shutterstock_jeffbezos.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Persistence pays off for online super-souk, but not for South American states&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos finally gets .Amazon after DNS overlord ICANN runs out of excuses to delay decision any further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/21/bezos_finally_gets_amazon/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the process itself, the only lessons learnt appear to be the wrong ones. ICANN continues to convince itself that it did the right thing, despite the evidence otherwise. There is no sign that the organization intends to carry out an After Action Review to highlight failings and make recommendations - a common approach in most large organizations but one which ICANN has never engaged in, leading it to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTO is still furious - at least on paper - and government representatives have learnt they can delay ICANN processes for years by sending the occasional letter and giving the occasional speech. In the end, it still took the intervention of the US government to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the companies of the world have learnt, again, that when it comes to ICANN, its processes are unreliable and can at any point be overturned by arbitrary decisions made by unaccountable staff. Forcing the DNS overseer to follow its own rules will require years of effort and millions of dollars in lawyers’ fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given other controversies surrounding ICANN in recent months, including extracting $20m from Verisign to sign the dot-com extension agreement, and the furore over the proposed sale of .org to an unknown private equity firm, it is no wonder that calls for reform of ICANN have grown louder in recent days. ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UBC study links living near highways to risk of neurological disorders</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content p402_premium&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://postmediavancouversun2.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/valley_1-w.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=840&amp;amp;h=630&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;630&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;UBC researchers have linked living near a highway with a higher risk of developing a neurological disorder.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;img-author&quot;&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Francis Georgian&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;Postmedia News Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of B.C. have found a link between living near highways and an increased risk of several major neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-0565-4&quot;&gt;published this week in Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt;, found proximity to major roads may also increase the risk for multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s diseases, likely because of exposure to more air pollution such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Weiran Yuchi, and a team of researchers at the UBC school of population and public health, analyzed data for 678,000 adults between the ages of 45 and 84 in Metro Vancouver. The subjects were interviewed from 1994 to 1998, and again during a follow-up period from 1999 to 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that living less than 50 metres from a major road or less than 150 metres from a highway is associated with a higher risk of the neurological disorders, while living near green spaces such as parks and forests reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In our research, we found that the green spaces have protective effects against developing the neurological disorders,” said Yuchi, adding that they measured green space using an index of satellite images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuchi said this is the first time UBC researchers have confirmed a link between air pollution and traffic proximity with a higher risk of dementia, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and MS at the population level. There are other epidemiological studies that have reported associations between road proximity and traffic-related air pollution with impaired cognitive function in adults and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://postmediavancouversun2.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/highway_study-w.jpg?quality=55&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Weiran Yuchi, a researcher at the UBC school of population and public health, is the lead author of a study that links living near highways with an increased risk of developing a neurological disorder such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;img-author&quot;&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;UBC handout&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living near a major road or highway was associated with a 14-per-cent risk for dementia, and seven per cent for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers did not identify a percentage for risk for MS and Alzheimer’s, they did find road proximity was associated with incidence of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuchi noted that the research does not make recommendations on whether people should be living near highways, but they do suggest more green spaces and accessibility to parks be included in urban planning efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said their research shows that there is a three to eight per cent reduction in the risk of developing the neurological disorders for those who live near parks or forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not make recommendations about how to minimize the risk for those who do live near major roadways, and say more research is needed. The study did not account for people who live near roads but spend a significant amount of time in nature hiking or visiting parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Brauer, the study’s senior author and professor in the UBC school of population and public health, said in a UBC statement that those who live close to a green space are likely to be more physically and socially active, and may benefit from the visual aspects of vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brauer added that the findings underscore the importance for city planners to ensure they incorporate greenery and parks when planning and developing residential neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was co-written by Hind Sbihi, Hugh Davies, and Lillian Tamburic in the UBC school of population and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now looking at national data which contains information for 20 per cent of the Canadian population, and they are hoping that this will provide more insight into the association between proximity to highways, air pollution, and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Infinite Loop That Wasn&amp;#039;t</title>
<link>https://mgba.io/2020/01/25/infinite-loop-holy-grail/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mgba.io/2020/01/25/infinite-loop-holy-grail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a game for the GBA by the name of Hello Kitty Collection: Miracle Fashion Maker. It was a cutesy game based on the famous Sanrio Hello Kitty franchise, developed by Imagineer. But hidden beneath the surface of the seemingly innocuous title was an insidious problem. Somehow, this simple game just did not boot in any GBA emulator. This alone was enough to qualify it as a Holy Grail bug. As with all Holy Grail bugs the bug itself was absolutely baffling. Here the explanation was simple: sometime during the game’s startup sequence, it enters a loop that can never exit due to expecting a specific value reading out of memory &lt;em&gt;that does not exist&lt;/em&gt;. While many games have similar bugs, such as the intro sequence in the high-profile game &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap&lt;/em&gt;, those rely on a specific behavior from reading invalid memory addresses. But this loop seemed to defy that behavior. And yet, it works on actual hardware. Moreover, this same bug also occurs in when loading a save in Sonic Pinball Party after a cold boot. Could the expectation of these invalid memory accesses be wrong somehow? But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mgba.io/assets/hai-kitty.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Kitty Collection: Miracle Fashion Maker&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-thats-illegal-isnt-it&quot;&gt;But That’s Illegal, Isn’t It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So wait, if you access invalid memory the game should just crash, right? An illegal operation has occurred or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault&quot;&gt;segfault&lt;/a&gt; or whatever you want to call it. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. Sort of. Not quite. Not on the GBA at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ARM, the CPU architecture that powers the GBA, this error condition is called a data abort and occurs when you try to access memory that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit&quot;&gt;memory management unit&lt;/a&gt; does not have mapped with read permissions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pabt&quot;/&gt;. When a data abort occurs, the CPU stops what it was doing and jumps to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table&quot;&gt;exception vector&lt;/a&gt; associated with data abort exceptions. The operating system can then decide if it should kill the current process, map in memory for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault&quot;&gt;page fault&lt;/a&gt;, try and let the process handle it like some emulator JITs do with “fastmem”, or various other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does the GBA handle a data abort? The exception vector entry for data aborts resides in the GBA boot ROM (or colloquially, “BIOS”). If a GBA gets a data abort it tries to jump to the DACS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dacs&quot;/&gt; handler if it exists, otherwise it hard-locks. No commercial games have DACS handlers. So why doesn’t it hard-lock? Simply, the GBA does not ever raise data aborts. It doesn’t have an MMU (or even a memory protection unit like the DS has), so it just keeps going and reads invalid memory out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beep-beep-here-comes-the-memory-bus&quot;&gt;Beep Beep! Here Comes the Memory Bus!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article-aside&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mgba.io/assets/bus.png&quot; alt=&quot;A bus&quot;/&gt; This isn’t a &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt; bus…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck is invalid memory? What does it look like? That’s the crux of the problem here. And it’s a complex situation; what it reads out is highly dependent on what the CPU has been doing recently, or more accurately, what the &lt;em&gt;memory bus&lt;/em&gt; has been doing recently. The short explanation is that on an invalid memory access the CPU reads out whatever was last on the memory bus. To figure out what that would entail requires a bit of insight into what a memory bus is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory bus is the bit of circuitry that connects the CPU to all of the different memory components on a platform. On the GBA there are several things attached to the memory bus, such as working RAM, video RAM, and the cartridge bus. Whenever the CPU tries to access memory it tells the memory bus which address it wants to access, which lights up the particular component that corresponds to that address. The component then puts the value at that address onto the bus, which may take a few cycles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ws&quot;/&gt;, and finally the CPU can read the value off of the bus. On the GBA, when no hardware is associated with that address, no value is put onto the bus, and the CPU reads out whatever the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; value put onto the bus was. This can be transformed in various ways, such as if it was a 16-bit read but the CPU is trying to do a 32-bit read, but it’s always going to be the value on the bus. Emulator developers refer to this as “open bus”, and I’ve written about how this affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://mgba.io/2017/05/29/holy-grail-bugs/#mega-man-battle-network-4&quot;&gt;other games&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;that-doesnt-sound-so-badright&quot;&gt;That Doesn’t Sound So Bad…Right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can just cache the last memory access, right? And then return that again? In general, that approach would work, but there are some complications. First, you need to make sure your memory accesses are all in the right order. This is harder than it sounds due to the fact that the CPU accesses memory every instruction to fetch the next instruction in the pipeline. And in fact, in general* the memory lingering on the bus is the last instruction that’s been fetched. This simplifies the process to just returning that last prefetched value. But since the last prefetched value depends solely on where you’re currently executing from in memory, it should always be the same. Even if the address you’re fetching changes, so long as it’s invalid you’ll always get the same memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh. Wait. But that loop exits, and it won’t exit if that value is the prefetch value. So what’s going on? If it’s always fetching the next instruction what could happen in between? I tried running similar infinite loops on test ROMs to see if, for example, the value could deteriorate. This can definitely happen if the value isn’t refreshed recently, but the value is refreshed every single instruction, so it doesn’t have time to deteriorate. My tests never exited the loop. I was doing something differently than these games, even though I had reproduced the loop exactly the same. What was I doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pokémon-emerald-and-the-hardware-only-ace&quot;&gt;Pokémon Emerald and the Hardware-Only ACE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this month, January 2020. The Sonic Pinball Party bug report is about three and a half years old at this point. It’s been known in other emulators for years. I’m out of working theories. Late that month a user named &lt;strong&gt;merrp&lt;/strong&gt; joins the mGBA Discord and mentions that there’s a new arbitrary code execution glitch for Pokémon Emerald that only works on hardware. Moreover, the glitch is likely going to be used by speedrunners, who might want to practice on emulator. Obviously this is a tempting target for a bugfix, though I wish I’d known before releasing 0.8.0. I start taking a look at the glitch and confirm merrp’s assertion that it only works on hardware. In every emulator I try it hangs on a black screen. But merrp tells me the thing it’s hanging on reading from invalid memory in a loop and I realize I’m probably not going to be able to fix it anytime soon. It’s &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; bug again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinpointing the function that’s looping gives me an edge this time. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald&quot;&gt;pokeemerald&lt;/a&gt; decompilation project that means I can easily make targeted changes to the function to try and figure out how it manages to break out of the loop. A simplified version of the loop in question looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-c highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;uint16_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int32_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;0xFFFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;uint16_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;0xFE00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;0x7E00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this is doing is pretty simple: there’s a two-dimensional table of values. For each row in this table for the specific column &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, it first tries to determine if it’s a specific “sentinel” value. If it is, stop looping. Otherwise, mask off the value and see if it’s larger than a check value. If it is, stop looping. Otherwise, do something else later in the loop. In the specific case of this glitch, the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is out of the bounds of the table, leading to an invalid pointer. This means that the trying to access the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;th element of this non-column will always access invalid memory. Though the offset into the table increases each iteration of the loop it would have to iterate hundreds of millions of times before it loops back to valid memory. So it’s clearly not doing that. So how does it break out of the loop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this I modified the loop to see what would happen if it just broke out of the loop immediately. Simply enough, the ACE worked on both hardware and emulator at that point, and did not hang at all. So instead I tried to set the screen color to the value it reads when it exits the loop and then hard-lock so the color doesn’t get changed. Recompiling it and running on a real GBA turns the screen a brilliant shade of blue after several seconds of hanging on a black screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO BLUE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On emulator it just hung on a black screen still. So what value would it read out if it was reading the prefetch value? Instead it turns a bit of a dull teal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it definitely was going through the loop at least once before it managed to break out. The amount of time it takes to break out of the loop on hardware seemed to be variable too. Anywhere from 2 to 30 seconds seemed pretty common. What was going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-working-theory&quot;&gt;A New Working Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed a difference between my test ROM and Pokémon Emerald when they hang. There was music playing in Pokémon. There was also music playing in Sonic Pinball Party. There wasn’t music playing in Hello Kitty, but this gave me an idea. What happens if an interrupt gets raised between prefetch and the data load? Will it start prefetching the interrupt vector before the invalid memory access? I quickly mocked this up in mGBA, turned on interrupts in the test ROM, and sure enough it broke out of the loop. So I tried the same test ROM on hardware and…it did not break out of the loop. So there goes that theory. Eventually I realized something. You saw that asterisk earlier I’m sure, so yes, there is one thing that can happen in between prefetch and the memory access, but only if the memory bus gets queried by something other than the CPU between the prefetch and invalid memory access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that the memory bus was managed by the CPU. This is mostly accurate, but there’s another piece of important hardware that can also access the memory bus, bypassing the CPU. This process is known as &lt;em&gt;direct memory access&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve described DMA in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mgba.io/2018/03/09/holy-grail-bugs-revisited/#the-great-gba-dma-disaster&quot;&gt;a previous article&lt;/a&gt; so I won’t go in much additional depth on the basics of DMA here. You might notice if you read the article again that it said the main CPU is paused while the DMA is running. So that means that while a DMA is running the bus value will now be the last memory access from the DMA. This is mostly relevant if a DMA runs off the end of valid memory into an invalid region; it will duplicate the last good value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been known for a while that if you load invalid memory within a DMA that you get the last DMA value, but it’s been a while since I implemented that in mGBA and I had forgotten about that. When I saw that in the invalid memory access code while contemplating the bug it suddenly clicked. What if the DMA value lingers on the bus for one instruction? If the first instruction after the DMA finishes loads invalid memory before it fetches the next value it should in theory load the DMA value again. Moreover, playing music on the GBA usually entails using DMAs to transfer the audio data to output. Though to do this properly would require a cycle accurate emulator that can block the CPU in the middle of instruction execution between the instruction start and the memory access, mGBA’s GBA emulation is not cycle accurate. This sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://mgba.io/2017/07/31/holy-grail-bugs-2/#speedy-gonzales-los-gatos-bandidos&quot;&gt;sounds familiar&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, I was able to figure out a workaround. It’s not perfect, but I can compare the expected CPU location for the instruction after the DMA with the current CPU location on an invalid load and use the DMA value instead of the prefetch value for that one address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-long-sought-solution&quot;&gt;The Long-Sought Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on H-blank DMAs in the test ROM I made and synced to V-blank so timing would be consistent, put it on hardware and…this time it worked! The test ROM consistently exited the loop after a specific number of iterations with the DMA value read out instead. I was correct! Implementing this in mGBA took a few tries to get right but sure enough it exited from the loop with the same results as on hardware. Suddenly I got the blue shade in mGBA. Hello Kitty booted. Sonic Pinball Party saving worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the longest I’ve spent on a single bug. Across over three years I’ve poured more hours into debugging this than I care to count, and I’m sure other developers have had similar experiences with their emulators too. Without that flash of insight it might have taken another year, or more, but staring at that black screen with nothing happening beyond music playing was the domino that knocked over the entire problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this solution has been found it can be implemented in other GBA emulators too, marking a definitive end to this bug. This bug will be fixed in mGBA 0.9.0 when that comes out hopefully later this year, and is already fixed in the development builds. You can finally play Hello Kitty Collection: Miracle Fashion Maker to your heart’s content. If that’s what you want. I won’t judge.&lt;/p&gt;
