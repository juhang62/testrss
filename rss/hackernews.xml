&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548255&quot;&gt;a newly published article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to &quot;refute&quot; concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.&lt;/p&gt;

The Rest Of Food Industry Pays For Lots Of Research, Too&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,&quot; co-author Stanton Glantz &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;amp;module=Trending&amp;amp;version=Full&amp;amp;region=Marginalia&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money on the line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that they worked under some limitations — &quot;We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,&quot; they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet — for the sake of their health — they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747943&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage451950106&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/27/451950106/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2015\/10\/27\/451950106\/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;In 'Soda Politics,' Big Soda At Crossroads Of Profit And Public Health&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the '60s, the SRF became aware of &quot;flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,&quot; as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommended that the industry fund its own studies — &quot;Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-secondary-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department — and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A different standard&quot; for different studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747963&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage214440426&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/08/23/214440426/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/13.7\/2013\/08\/23\/214440426\/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Obesity And The Toxic-Sugar Wars&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's &quot;particular interest&quot; was in evaluating studies focused on &quot;carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are well aware,&quot; one of the scientists replied, &quot;and will cover this as well as we can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickson was certainly happy with the result: &quot;Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,&quot; he told one of the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/0/ISC160005supp1_prod.pdf&quot;&gt;minimized the significance&lt;/a&gt; of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,&quot; Kearns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/how-big-sugar-enlisted-harvard-scientists-to-influence-how-we-eat-in-1965&quot;&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; via email. But, she says, &quot;the authors applied a different standard&quot; to different studies — looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies of sugar consumption — which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world — were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because &quot;such diets are rarely consumed by man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat — which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing &quot;few study characteristics and no quantitative results,&quot; as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was &quot;no doubt&quot; the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar lobby: &quot;Transparency standards were not the norm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Sugar Association — which evolved out of the SRF — said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,&quot; the association said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,&quot; the statement continues. &quot;What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251&quot;&gt;notes in a commentary&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;edTag&quot; readability=&quot;5.9810126582278&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,&quot; they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Saturday called on China to make available data from the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak, saying it has “deep concerns” about the way the findings of the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 report were communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside a building of the World Health Organization (WHO) during an executive board meeting on update on the coronavirus outbreak, in Geneva, Switzerland, February 6, 2020. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that it is imperative that the report be independent and free from “alteration by the Chinese government”, echoing concerns raised by the administration of former President Donald Trump, who also moved to quit the WHO over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy fired back with a strongly-worded statement, saying the United States had damaged multilateral cooperation and the WHO in recent years, and should not be “pointing fingers” at China and other countries that supported the WHO during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;China welcomed the U.S. decision to reengage with the WHO, but Washington should hold itself to the “highest standards” instead of taking aim at other countries, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said all hypotheses were still open about the origins of COVID-19, after Washington said it wanted to review data from a WHO-led mission to China, where the virus first emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;A WHO-led mission, which spent four weeks in China probing the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak, said this week that it was not looking further into the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab, which it considered highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The Trump administration had said it suspected the virus may have escaped from a Chinese lab, which Beijing strongly denies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Sullivan noted that U.S. President Joe Biden had quickly reversed the decision to disengage from the WHO, but said it was imperative to protect the organization’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“Re-engaging the WHO also means holding it to the highest standards,” Sullivan said. “We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Biden, who is spending his first weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, was due to meet with his national security advisers on Saturday, a White House official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;China refused to give raw data on early COVID-19 cases to the WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, according to one of the team’s investigators, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The team had requested raw patient data on 174 cases that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary, Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert and member of the WHO team, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ziglings: Learn the Zig programming language by fixing tiny broken programs</title>
<link>https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;code&gt;ziglings&lt;/code&gt;! This project contains a series of tiny broken programs. By fixing them, you'll learn how to read and write &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;/a&gt; code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was directly inspired by the brilliant and fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings&quot;&gt;rustlings&lt;/a&gt; project for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; language. Indirect inspiration comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubykoans.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ruby Koans&lt;/a&gt; and the Little LISPer/Little Schemer series of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intended Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will probably be difficult if you've &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; programmed before. But no specific programming experience is required. And in particular, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; expected to have any prior experience with &quot;systems programming&quot; or a &quot;systems&quot; level language such as C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each exercise is self-contained and self-explained. However, you're encouraged to also check out these Zig language resources for more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;master build&lt;/a&gt; of the Zig compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the installation and version of &lt;code&gt;zig&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ zig version
0.8.0-dev.1065+&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;some hexadecimal string&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone this repository with Git:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ziglings
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;zig build&lt;/code&gt; and follow the instructions to begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Note About Compiler Versions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zig language is under very active development. Ziglings will attempt to be current, but not bleeding-edge. However, sometimes fundamental changes will happen. Ziglings will check for a minimum version and build number (which is this one: &lt;code&gt;0.x.x-dev.&amp;lt;build number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and exit if your version of Zig is too old. It is likely that you'll download a build which is greater than the number in the example shown above in this README. That's okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a version of the Zig compiler that works with your copy of Ziglings, they'll continue to work together forever. But if you update one, keep in mind that you may need to also update the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to run a single file for testing, you can do so with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zig run exercises/01_hello.zig
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, alternatively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zig build 01_test
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify a single file, use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zig build 01_only
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare an executable for debugging, install it to zig-cache/bin with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zig build 01_install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributions are very welcome! I'm writing this to teach myself and to create the learning resource I wished for. There will be tons of room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wording of explanations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idiomatic usage of Zig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned exercises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial topics for these exercises were unabashedly cribbed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglearn.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ziglearn.org&lt;/a&gt;. I've since moved things around in an order that I think best lets each topic build upon each other.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Our brutal science system almost cost us a pioneer of mRNA vaccines</title>
<link>https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2021/02/12/brutal-science-system-mrna-pioneer</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2021/02/12/brutal-science-system-mrna-pioneer</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;261&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Lately, my social media feeds have been filled with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/12/30/coronavirus-vaxxies-are-the-new-selfies-moos-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;vaxxies&lt;/a&gt;&quot; — selfies of health care friends getting COVID-19 vaccines and gushing about how the shots brought them hope or relief. Many express gratitude for the science that yielded the vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;262&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;When I got my own shot — after working the chaotic first surge at an understaffed hospital in March and April — I felt an added emotion: awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;263&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;You see, I witnessed some of the early scientific heartbreaks that came before the historic vaccine victories. And I found myself simply awestruck by the scientists I knew who persevered in spite of our system of scientific research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;264&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;The system helped lead to progress, but it also demoralized a junior researcher to the point that anyone of less grit and determination would have just given up long before the groundwork for today’s vaccines was laid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;265&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Existential Career Threat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;266&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Here’s my story: 20 years ago, I worked part-time in a tumble-down laboratory in a dusty corner of an old medical school building at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was an undergrad. For three years, I studied HIV replication in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-T-Cells.aspx#:~:text=T%20cells%20are%20a%20part,in%20immunity%20to%20foreign%20substances.&quot;&gt;T-cells&lt;/a&gt; under researchers Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;267&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;These days, they are coronavirus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/december/penn-mrna-biology-pioneers-receive-covid19-vaccine-enabled-by-their-foundational-research&quot;&gt;vaccine heroes&lt;/a&gt;, but back then, their very early work on mRNA vaccines aimed to fight HIV. After spending my first four months in the lab on an experiment that never worked, I learned that good science is really, really hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;268&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;I didn’t know it at the time, but I also absorbed what I later could describe as the sociology of science — how the sausage is made — and it wasn’t always pretty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium article-image lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://placehold.it/1x1/f8f8f8/f8f8f8&quot; data-src=&quot;https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/02/DaveKati-400x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;From the photo album of author David Scales (second from right), the 2001 lab team that included Katalin Karikó (third from left.)&quot; data-reactid=&quot;270&quot;/&gt;From the photo album of author David Scales (second from right), the 2001 lab team that included Katalin Karikó (third from left.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;272&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;While Weissman was an expert at designing experiments, I remember him most for his generosity. He made sure all contributors in the lab shared the credit, from the lab tech and lowly undergrad all the way to fellow researcher Karikó.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;273&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Still, Karikó was struggling. Her science was fantastic, but she was less adept at the competitive game of science. She tried again and again to win grants, and each time, her applications were rejected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;274&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Eventually, in the mid-1990s, she suffered the academic indignity of demotion, meaning she was taken off the academic ladder that leads to becoming a professor. We never discussed it personally because by the time I joined the lab, Karikó’s history was still only discussed in hushed tones as a cautionary tale for young scientists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;275&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;I learned that while universities pay the salaries of many of their professors in English or anthropology, they expect faculty in the medical schools to pay their own way with either clinical work or external research funding. This puts tremendous financial pressure on eager young medical researchers, sometimes leading them not to the projects that are most needed or that they are most passionate about, but to the projects that will get them funding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;276&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Karikó lived that nightmare, but stuck to her passions. She was too committed to the promise of mRNA to switch to other, perhaps more easily fundable projects. Eventually, the university stopped supporting her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;277&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;It’s hard to describe what this moment means to people who have never worked in science at a university, but it is more than the frustration of an experiment not working or laudable work going unrecognized. It is an existential career threat. Everything you have worked for your entire life is suddenly in jeopardy. It is a forced career change on the assumption that if you can’t get the grants, you’re not a good enough scientist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;278&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Clearly, this was a false assumption in Karikó’s case. She was a dynamo, with a passion for science that rubbed off on those around her. I remember one lab meeting where she arrived with a copy of Science or Nature magazine, absorbed in a new study that showed some cool biological feature of how cells reacted under stress. It wasn't her area of research, yet she was still in awe of the beauty and intricacy our cells are imbued with, and her enthusiasm was infectious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;279&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Scientist To Her Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;280&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;She also shared jaw-dropping anecdotes about working as a scientist in the Eastern Bloc, from the cutthroat competition in school to the practice of smoking cigarettes in the lab (except when someone opened a container of very flammable ether).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;For Karikó, who had persevered under those extraordinarily difficult circumstances in communist Hungary, demotion was particularly bitter. Most people in such circumstances end up leaving the university, but she pressed on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;282&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;I think she had to. Mark Doty, a poet, visited and gave a talk my senior year at Penn. Afterwards, a student and aspiring poet asked when and how Doty knew he was willing to endure the sacrifices it took to be a poet, with all the rejections, the financial struggle and the economic instability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Doty said that he couldn’t not be a poet. He tried other things and just wasn’t happy. For him, it wasn’t a choice. Seeing Karikó get so excited about scientific findings that weren’t even related to her research, I got a similar sense about her too: she couldn’t not be a scientist. It was baked into her bones. Luckily for us, now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;284&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;It’s the secret you don’t learn in school. We know doing good science is hard. But it isn’t only difficult because divining nature’s secrets is a unique challenge. It is unbelievably, brutally difficult for all of the other non-science skills that are needed but not explicitly taught: writing grants (“grantsmanship”), getting invited to speak at conferences, building collaborative research relationships, having the political awareness to attract allies and mentors within a department or university who can help find support for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;285&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;It’s the sociology of doing science at a university that makes science even harder than it already is. Usually, stories like Karikó’s end in obscurity and disappointment. Add in being a woman and an immigrant, and it makes her perseverance even more inspiring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;286&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Were Right, Kati&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;287&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;For me, seeing such an impressive mentor struggle so hard acted as a powerful push away from doing science. I spent a year abroad studying history and philosophy of science, learning the social processes by which scientific facts become solidified, then studied medicine and sociology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;288&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;But lately, I have found myself drawn back to science, as empirical facts are dismissed with a tweet. If anything, the problems Karikó faced have gotten worse over the past 20 years. It is high time for scientists to save science. But, at its best, science can produce beauty, wonder and, occasionally, through the hard work of very dedicated individuals, it can produce technologies that save millions of lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;289&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;The coronavirus vaccine has demonstrated that we need good science - and good scientists - now more than ever. And we need to make sure that they stay in science, one way or another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;290&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;Academic science failed Karikó. But when she contacted me in 2015, I saw she had moved to the private sector, a common path for researchers when a university stops offering support. I was glad to see she had landed on her feet. And now, I watch in awe, like the rest of the world, as the technology she helped developed leads to one of the most spectacular victories in the history of science - a vaccine for a deadly pandemic developed in less than one year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-reactid=&quot;291&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;So, my vaccination day was an emotional one. As the lipid-encapsulated mRNA molecules went into my arm, I reminisced about Kati and Drew, and the lab circa 2000. And I thought: You were right, Kati. You were right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Silicon Valley’s Safe Space</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More than 7,500 people signed a petition urging The Times not to publish his name, including many prominent figures in the tech industry. “Putting his full name in The Times,” the petitioners said, “would meaningfully damage public discourse, by discouraging private citizens from sharing their thoughts in blog form.” On the internet, many in Silicon Valley believe, everyone has the right not only to say what they want but to say it anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amid all this, I spoke with Manoel Horta Ribeiro, a computer science researcher who explores social networks at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. He was worried that Slate Star Codex, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08313&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like other communities&lt;/a&gt;, was allowing extremist views to trickle into the influential tech world. “A community like this gives voice to fringe groups,” he said. “It gives a platform to people who hold more extreme views.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But for Kelsey Piper and many others, the main issue came down to the name, and tying the man known professionally and legally as Scott Siskind to his influential, and controversial, writings as Scott Alexander. Ms. Piper, who is a journalist herself, for the news site Vox, said she did not agree with everything he had written, but she also felt his blog was unfairly painted as an on-ramp to radical views. She worried his views could not be reduced to a single newspaper story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I assured her my goal was to report on the blog, and the Rationalists, with rigor and fairness. But she felt that discussing both critics and supporters could be unfair. What I needed to do, she said, was somehow prove statistically which side was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When I asked Mr. Altman if the conversation on sites like Slate Star Codex could push people toward toxic beliefs, he said he held “some empathy” for these concerns. But, he added, “people need a forum to debate ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In August, Mr. Siskind restored his old blog posts to the internet. And two weeks ago, he relaunched his blog on Substack, a company with ties to both Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator. He gave the blog a new title: Astral Codex Ten. He &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/logistics&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; that Substack paid him $250,000 for a year on the platform. And he indicated the company would give him all the protection he needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-axufdj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In his first post, Mr. Siskind shared his full name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Google is now a Visionary Sponsor of the Python Software Foundation</title>
<link>http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our top sponsors—companies who step forward to make the biggest investment in Python and its community—not only use Python for their own internal development, but also offer Python as a crucial part of the products they offer to their own customers. That is certainly true of Google,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/sponsors/&quot;&gt;the Python Software Foundation’s first Visionary Sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google's donations and sponsorship funds will be used to support a number of PSF initiatives, including the first CPython Developer in Residence. The Python Steering Council and Python Software Foundation will work together to contract a developer to help CPython determine what needs to take priority through analytical metrics as well as helping CPython understand how backlog can be addressed. The role will also be responsible for surveying maintainers to paint a better landscape of CPython, which will be used to ensure future funding and volunteer hours are used efficiently and effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, the sponsorship funds will also be used towards critical supply-chain security improvements, including developing productized malware detection for PyPI, a prototype of dynamic analysis infrastructure for distributions, and other foundational tool improvements.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google has been a Python Software Foundation sponsor since 2010. Our hearts are full of gratitude for their support.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/open-source/supporting-the-python-ecosystem&quot;&gt;You can read more about how Google is supporting the Python ecosystem on their blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;If your organization is interested in supporting the PSF's initiatives, please&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship-new/&quot;&gt;check out our newly renovated sponsorship program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://michaelyingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/subtitle.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;explanation&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;I have always been a big fan of Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbes comics, and their author, Bill Watterson. Since discovering the complete script online, as well as a collection of every daily strip on another website, I knew I could make the two reference each other and therefore create a &quot;Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbes Search Engine&quot; for lack of a better name. So I set out to do it.&lt;p&gt;Currently the search only looks for EXACT phrases (not case sensitive), so if you're looking for a comic with the words &quot;balloon&quot; and &quot;airplane&quot; you cannot enter them both, or it will search for &quot;balloon airplane&quot; together. Perhaps in the future I will fix this, but it's actually a lot more difficult than leaving it as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one exception though! You can search for a DATE and it will find that specific comic, &lt;del&gt;though it MUST be of the format MM/DD/YYYY. So 09/01/1986 will work, but &quot;Sept 1st '86&quot; and &quot;9/1/86&quot; wont - yet.&lt;/del&gt; All date formats work now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please find the credits for everything found on this page below. Please note that the comic images are kindly hosted by Marcello, and that Andrews McMeel Universal holds the right to Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbes. Thanks for visiting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Michael &quot;Bing&quot; Yingling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
