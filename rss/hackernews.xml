&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548255&quot;&gt;a newly published article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to &quot;refute&quot; concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.&lt;/p&gt;

The Rest Of Food Industry Pays For Lots Of Research, Too&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,&quot; co-author Stanton Glantz &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;amp;module=Trending&amp;amp;version=Full&amp;amp;region=Marginalia&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money on the line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747959&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage172969363&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/02/26/172969363/how-the-food-industry-manipulates-taste-buds-with-salt-sugar-fat&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2013\/02\/26\/172969363\/how-the-food-industry-manipulates-taste-buds-with-salt-sugar-fat&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/02/26/istock_000013301504xsmall_sq-43e9278e575c7a9a2612017468f0142c989467bb-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/02/26/istock_000013301504xsmall_sq-43e9278e575c7a9a2612017468f0142c989467bb-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;How The Food Industry Manipulates Taste Buds With 'Salt Sugar Fat'&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that they worked under some limitations — &quot;We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,&quot; they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet — for the sake of their health — they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747943&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage451950106&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/27/451950106/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2015\/10\/27\/451950106\/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;In 'Soda Politics,' Big Soda At Crossroads Of Profit And Public Health&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the '60s, the SRF became aware of &quot;flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,&quot; as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommended that the industry fund its own studies — &quot;Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department — and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A different standard&quot; for different studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747963&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage214440426&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/08/23/214440426/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/13.7\/2013\/08\/23\/214440426\/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Obesity And The Toxic-Sugar Wars&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's &quot;particular interest&quot; was in evaluating studies focused on &quot;carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are well aware,&quot; one of the scientists replied, &quot;and will cover this as well as we can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickson was certainly happy with the result: &quot;Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,&quot; he told one of the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/0/ISC160005supp1_prod.pdf&quot;&gt;minimized the significance&lt;/a&gt; of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,&quot; Kearns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/how-big-sugar-enlisted-harvard-scientists-to-influence-how-we-eat-in-1965&quot;&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; via email. But, she says, &quot;the authors applied a different standard&quot; to different studies — looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies of sugar consumption — which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world — were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because &quot;such diets are rarely consumed by man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat — which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing &quot;few study characteristics and no quantitative results,&quot; as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was &quot;no doubt&quot; the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar lobby: &quot;Transparency standards were not the norm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Sugar Association — which evolved out of the SRF — said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,&quot; the association said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,&quot; the statement continues. &quot;What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251&quot;&gt;notes in a commentary&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;edTag&quot; readability=&quot;5.9810126582278&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,&quot; they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;01a6&quot; id=&quot;01a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I knew I wanted a job in the Bay Area where I could really grow from a mobile perspective at a larger company. I’ve worked at startups before and I’ve loved it, but for a few reasons, I was looking at the big fish this go-around (in terms of valuation, not strictly team size). I also knew that I wasn’t positive where I wanted to work or how much compensation I’d need to match what I’m making now. I &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; knew I didn’t want to apply to 100+ places like I did when I was graduating from college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2218&quot; id=&quot;2218&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All told, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I applied to 20 companies&lt;/strong&gt;. I was &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;explicitly rejected by 4&lt;/strong&gt; of those companies (Reddit, Nest, Stripe, Uber) after applying. Of the remaining 16, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;10 companies never responded&lt;/strong&gt; to me either way (Lyft, Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube, Square, Robinhood, Twitter, Snap, Slack). Math dictates &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;6 companies followed up with a recruiter screen&lt;/strong&gt;. Of those 6 companies, I was able to get &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;phone screens with 6&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;onsites with 6&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;offers from 6&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be8b&quot; id=&quot;be8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Reviewing my Google Calendar, I believe I had (approximately):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b13e&quot; id=&quot;b13e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;7 recruiter screens in 10 days&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li name=&quot;2c3f&quot; id=&quot;2c3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;29 onsite interviews in 8 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5480&quot; id=&quot;5480&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;3 follow-up phone interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;05fa&quot; id=&quot;05fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Adding up the above says &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I had 46 interviews in 73 days&lt;/strong&gt; (including gaps between each step). It was exhausting and it meant that most of my lunch breaks were just interviews for multiple weeks. I had to start going into work very early so I could leave earlier to take calls at home. Making sure I was still meeting all of my commitments at work was a challenge, too, but I made sure to prioritize that over interviewing, rescheduling when necessary. I wouldn’t phone it in for the purposes of interviewing. It makes you look bad, it’s unethical, and if you don’t get a job, you’re now a lower performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0693&quot; id=&quot;0693&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;LinkedIn’s mobile apps are actually pretty slick and they have some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linkedin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=objective-c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/linkedin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=objective-c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solid contributions&lt;/a&gt; to the open source community. I was very impressed throughout the entire interview process with LinkedIn from both a culture perspective and an engineering perspective. They rose the highest on my mental list of iOS Prestige™ from the start of the process until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e838&quot; id=&quot;e838&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Yelp has a really beautiful app with tons of iOS subtleties that show an understanding of the platform. I loved the vibe onsite. They have a beautiful building and I’d love to work with any of my interviewers. They’re much smaller than any of the other companies I applied to and it showed in all of the good ways. It seemed very tight knit and the process moved &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5d37&quot; id=&quot;5d37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Apple’s been an important part of iOS for a while (har har). I grew up an extreme Apple fanboy (since the age of 12, at least). The Mac originally got me into programming. The iPhone SDK encouraged me to build and ship my first app. It was absolutely surreal to have them invite me onsite and later extend me an offer. I don’t know what else there is to say on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4cea&quot; id=&quot;4cea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I wouldn’t consider Amazon a “mobile-first” as a company (at all). This position/team, though, met the criteria I laid out to start. I wasn’t in love with the Palo Alto building I was in specifically, but it’s a temporary office until they move into a more Amazon-y building, so it’s mostly poor interview timing on that front. The people I spoke to seemed pretty dedicated to their product. Although every company loved telling me that “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;it really feels like a startup!&lt;/em&gt;”, it rang the truest at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9558&quot; id=&quot;9558&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I interviewed Facebook’s newest building. I thought it was really cool overall, although I’m somewhat hazy on the details about how the interview itself went because I was on my fifth consecutive day of interviewing with inadequate sleep. I do remember really enjoying the people I spoke with and having a very insightful lunch interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;d356&quot; id=&quot;d356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Google, to my understanding, does pretty “generic” interviews for a given role. I spoke to a lot of members from one of Google’s biggest products on iOS, but I wasn’t interviewing for a position specifically with that team. After I passed through Google’s hiring committee I moved on to the team matching phase and ultimately matched up with a team. It’s a very &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;loooooong&lt;/em&gt; process relative to the rest of the companies I spoke with, so I definitely had to keep everyone updated on where Google was. I also had to let Google know where I was with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5abf&quot; id=&quot;5abf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Study Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33c2&quot; id=&quot;33c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;To be clear, I was starting from a position where I could probably do most Leetcode Easy problems in ~30 minutes, and I could maybe solve 25% of Leetcode Medium problems with infinite time. Solving Leetcode Hard problems were akin to trying to solve P=NP. In short, I had a large gap to bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba4b&quot; id=&quot;ba4b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To study algorithms &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I began first with&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On Sunday mornings I’d wake up and go to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/helbachs-coffee-house-madison&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/helbachs-coffee-house-madison&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coffee shop&lt;/a&gt; and grind out some problems in Objective-C. Once I did enough problems in CtCI (I think I solved ~35 problems) I would review a handful of Leetcode problems in the chapters I’d gone over. After a few weeks of this, I felt I had “the basics” down and moved on to my next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f89&quot; id=&quot;9f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the basics down, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I moved on to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479274836/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479274836/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Elements of Programming Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This book is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; more difficult than CtCI. The book has recommended study plans that I stuck pretty closely with. I think there was one that planned on four weeks of studying and I got through almost all of it. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;It is critical, in my opinion, to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone&lt;/strong&gt;. Not critical as in “very important”, but critical as in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;you should consider it an absolute requirement when studying&lt;/em&gt;. I’m sure you can get a job without it, but it’s the single best form of practice I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d62&quot; id=&quot;9d62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CS Career Hackers&lt;/a&gt; and maybe we can work something out, time permitting. If not me, there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;That’s the point&lt;/em&gt;. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you? &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing.&lt;/strong&gt; It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a611&quot; id=&quot;a611&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After about a month of consistently practicing problems each day (maybe 2–3 hours/day, more on weekends) I moved on to doing primarily Leetcode’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Top Interview Questions&lt;/a&gt;”. I didn’t do them all but I did “enough”. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The key to preparing algorithm interviews is to get yourself to a point that you can figure out a problem during the interview,&lt;/strong&gt; not necessarily to know how to do every problem. That’s impossible. Almost all of the questions I heard over my week of onsites were “new” to me yet similar to questions I’d seen. That’s how most development goes in the industry, too. You have a lot of similar problems but your particular use case has special constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6601&quot; id=&quot;6601&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a21f&quot; id=&quot;a21f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m going to present a bunch of lessons I learned as bullet points in no particular order. Everything listed below is something I wish I knew beforehand, both in terms of preparation on the technical side and in terms of scheduling and other non-technical tips. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;These lessons are not iOS-specific and I’d imagine are generally applicable to all interviews in our industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;9449&quot; id=&quot;9449&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;📚 &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Stick with it.&lt;/strong&gt; When I was looking for a job out of school I gave up after one or two weeks of studying. I reasoned that I simply was not cut out to learn the stuff. There was minimal progress from when I first started for weeks, so what was the point of wasting any more time? This time around, I figured I didn’t have a choice. Eventually, things started falling into place. It’s a lot of work, but the willingness to learn is what separates successful candidates from the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;21e4&quot; id=&quot;21e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤓 Practice is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything.&lt;/strong&gt; You certainly need a baseline of innate ability, but practice (i.e. learning) can fill in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wide ability gaps. Companies don’t hire people based on the knowledge they were born with. They hire those that can perform their duties and perform them well, regardless of where/when they cultivated the knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0bde&quot; id=&quot;0bde&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;👫 Practicing with a friend is everything &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether on a whiteboard or on something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeshare.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://codeshare.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codeshare&lt;/a&gt;, simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before, as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously, that kind of practice is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;invaluable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d4b7&quot; id=&quot;d4b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;📊 It’s a numbers game.&lt;/strong&gt; You can practice — effectively, even — and not land a job because the right person didn’t see your resumé or you just didn’t see a solution to a whiteboard problem in time. The best you can hope to do is maximize your odds. This means applying everywhere you would like to work and fit a job req and not just your top choice. I applied for my top 20!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4ee8&quot; id=&quot;4ee8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤔 Focus on the problem solving, not the solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Memorization isn’t enough. Of ~20 algorithm problems I saw in a week I had seen maybe one of the problems before (and I let my interviewer know, though many would disagree with that choice). I just saw lots of common patterns and I was able to come up with solutions on the fly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4b65&quot; id=&quot;4b65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;😣 Don’t get discouraged.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple interviews I had where I didn’t know the solution and interviewers had to shepherd me towards a solution. I still got offers from everywhere I interviewed. Also, I felt I absolutely &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;bombed&lt;/em&gt; one of my interviews (four of my five that day I thought were solid “no hires”) and the company later extended me an offer. Anything can happen, evidently. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a465&quot; id=&quot;a465&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤯 Don’t be quick to disregard problems.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple times I was practicing with a friend of mine and he shrugged off particularly difficult problems as pointless to know. Curiously enough, of the four types of problems I recall him saying would “never” come up, two of them did. Not in the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; form we were going to practice, but very similar. If your practice shows a certain concept come up frequently, learn it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;bf88&quot; id=&quot;bf88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🧐 Don’t underestimate the importance of behavioral questions&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I enjoyed a lot of success because my (honest) answers were what companies wanted. It’s my theory that many developers have strong technical skills and still struggle to find their perfect job because they’re rude, dishonest, or uncomfortable speaking to people outside of a technical setting. These are all justifiable reasons to reject a candidate, in my opinion. Practice them just as you would technical questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;340f&quot; id=&quot;340f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🧠 If you know more, show it.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple examples during my onsites where I would answer a question and mention some other knowledge I had but explain that I didn’t have time in an interview to fully implement that solution. Answering a question about strings? Show off your Unicode knowledge with your solution or explain how to support Unicode. Implementing a private method? Talk about the Objective-C conventions for methods. Updating a table view? Talk about the different animations you can support. Don’t bring something up if you can’t talk all about it, but if you can, it allows you to show knowledge outside of the narrow window provided by the question and gives you a leg up on anyone that sticks strictly to the beaten path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a006&quot; id=&quot;a006&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;💪 Don’t strive to clear the bar, strive to set it.&lt;/strong&gt; Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company, but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer, that’s great. But keep in mind there’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter! My initial (i.e. not negotiated) offers came in pretty solid despite my relative lack of experience and I believe interview performance played a big role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;a319&quot; id=&quot;a319&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f148&quot; id=&quot;f148&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;So that’s that! It was a crazy ride and I have no regrets. I truly, genuinely hope that the above can help someone get over the hump when it comes to landing a job they’ve dreamed about. If there’s particular interest in iOS-specific help, I can publish some tips, so please comment and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7eb&quot; id=&quot;d7eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If it’s of any use: I was interviewing for my second job out of college with about two and a half years of experience without any particularly notable internships or employers on my resume; I went to a very small school that had zero known software companies at their “career fair”; I started preparing in late April and started applying in June/July; and, lastly, a few months in, my job is everything I could have possibly dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e24&quot; id=&quot;0e24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I’d like to shout out the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;CS Career Hackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;community one last time.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re looking for a place to practice and talk with others in similar situations (or those that have been through it on either side), please do check it out. 👍 I didn’t find it until a few months after I signed my offer, but it’s a great place nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf0f&quot; id=&quot;cf0f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Happy studying, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEWAUNEE COUNTY, Wis.—Chuck Wagner has given up on drawing clean water from his faucets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he moved, 23 years ago, to 80 acres situated between dairy farms in northeastern Wisconsin, he built a home and drilled a 123-foot well. The water tested clean, and his family drank it. Five years later, tests showed it was contaminated with bacteria and nitrates, potentially harmful and often derived from nitrogen in manure and fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contamination increased over time, and his family now drinks bottled water. Mr. Wagner, a 68-year-old retired engineer, believes the pollutants are from the dairies next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those, Kinnard Farms, keeps 7,000 Holsteins and spreads the manure on nearby fields. “Farmers are a big footprint,” says Lee Kinnard, 50, who runs the fifth-generation dairy. “I’m not going to say that what we do on the surface can’t have an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. farms, more productive than ever, are poisoning drinking water for rural Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in seven Americans drink from private wells, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Nitrate concentrations rose significantly in 21% of regions where USGS researchers tested groundwater from 2002 through 2012, compared with the 13 prior years. The greatest increases were in agricultural areas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nawqatrends.wim.usgs.gov/Decadal/?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;More recent sampling&lt;/a&gt; shows the pattern is continuing, at a potentially greater rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, more than 16% of groundwater from wells sampled between 2002 and 2012 topped the federal nitrate limit of 10 parts per million, versus 12% in the 1990s. The percentage above the limit fell slightly in the wells sampled after 2013 but remained elevated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The worst-kept secret is how vulnerable private wells are to agricultural runoff,” says David Cwiertny, director of the University of Iowa’s Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wagners and Kinnards live in one of many U.S. regions where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-family-farm-bulks-up-1508781895?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the interests of the agricultural economy&lt;/a&gt; are colliding with those of residents relying on aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kewaunee County, nearly 30% of private wells contain bacteria or elevated levels of nitrates, according to a state-commissioned study of samples taken in 2015 and 2016. An administrative-law judge, ruling on an objection from residents to a Kinnard Farms expansion plan, called the county’s water problem a crisis and allowed the dairy to proceed on the condition it take steps to prevent contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among factors producing contaminants: fewer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-family-farm-bulks-up-1508781895?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;more-intensively worked farms&lt;/a&gt;, bigger cows and shifting crop mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those factors have helped drive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-behind-the-glut-in-agricultural-commodities-1476670020?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;abundance in the U.S. farm economy&lt;/a&gt;.

Farmers and their supporters say America needs to balance environmental concerns with food security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers can’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-cant-move-its-cheese-11545042600?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;produce milk and cheese&lt;/a&gt; at the low prices American consumers have grown accustomed to without some effect on water, says Mr. Kinnard, who says practices he and his peers are implementing will improve Kewaunee’s soils and water over time. “The alternative here,” he says, “is a society that depends upon other countries to feed us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One farm-economy byproduct is manure, which farmers spread across millions of acres and contains nutrients such as nitrates that researchers have associated with birth defects, thyroid problems, cancer and a potentially fatal condition in infants. Another byproduct is decades-old water, laden with nitrates from a nationwide run-up in chemical-fertilizer usage, that is sinking closer to drinking water in some areas, says Bruce Lindsey, a USGS hydrologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dynamic-inset-container article__inset__dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runoff from fields is largely exempt from federal regulation. Many water utilities in the Midwest are struggling to pay for flushing farm runoff from their systems, say scientists and utility managers. Close to 500 public water systems in the U.S. exceeded federal nitrate limits in 2016, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. That is a sliver of the nation’s 151,000 water systems but a 13% increase from the portion that surpassed the limit two decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towns sometimes abandon contaminated wells or mix water from multiple wells to dilute contaminants instead of making expensive treatment upgrades, say researchers such as Bruce Dvorak, a University of Nebraska civil-engineering professor. Some small towns hesitate to pressure farmers, who generate jobs and tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a broken system,” says Bill Stowe, chief executive of Des Moines Water Works, referring to how municipalities must pay for contamination from upstream farms. His utility lost a federal lawsuit in 2017 to force three counties to clean farm runoff draining into the Iowa capital’s drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists say groundwater contamination could be cut by reducing fertilizer use. Other land researchers and environmentalists want farmers to reduce use of underground pipes that wick water and its contents away from fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land researchers are urging farmers to change cultivation practices to cut water contamination. That includes sowing “cover crops” to hold soil in place between plantings and adding buffers of fallow land along field edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin last year, then-Gov. Scott Walker approved stricter manure-spreading standards for vulnerable fields in eastern parts of the state including Kewaunee. The county in 2016 prohibited manure-spreading over shallow soils from January to mid-April, which officials say has reduced well-water contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, “our ability to reduce nitrate losses is not as impactful as people would hope,” says University of Wisconsin groundwater specialist Kevin Masarik. He says many dairy farmers in Kewaunee are seeking to expand, and “it’s unclear where all that manure is going to go and do we have the tools and oversight in place to make sure it’s done in a good way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin saw more than a sixfold increase in the number of public water systems with nitrate topping 10 parts per million between 1994 and 2017, according to its natural-resources department. Some hotels and gas stations in the state warn customers such as pregnant women not to drink from taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Evers, who defeated Mr. Walker for the governorship in November, pledged during his campaign to clean up drinking water. On Jan. 2, state and federal researchers released data showing widespread well-water contamination in three southwest-Wisconsin counties that are home to thin soils and intensive agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;A county crisis&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kewaunee County, the frequency with which pathogens including E. coli, salmonella, rotavirus and cryptosporidium occur in water is similar to what researchers might expect to find in some developing countries, says Mark Borchardt, a U.S. Agriculture Department microbiologist who led the studies in Kewaunee and southwest Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some contamination comes from septic systems, he says. In parts of Kewaunee County, more than one-fifth of private wells surpassed the federal nitrate limit, according to data aggregated by the University of Wisconsin since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county welcomes visitors with a sign: “The Good Life on a Great Lake.” Farmers here are praised at their funerals for not missing a day of milking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kinnard of Kinnard Farms says his ancestors, dairy farmers and fisherman from Belgium, were drawn in the 1800s to the Lake Michigan breezes that could keep cows cool and to soils suited to the alfalfa the animals ate. They brought nine cows whose descendants still reside in Kinnard barns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kinnard points to nine smaller dairies that have disappeared from the valley surrounding his farm in recent years—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-transformation-of-the-american-farm-in-18-charts-1514474480?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;part of a broader consolidation among American farms&lt;/a&gt;. Kinnard Farms has absorbed more than 100 farms over the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many smaller dairies nationwide have folded as falling U.S. milk consumption depressed prices. As of 2012, half of U.S. dairy cows were on farms with more than 900 cows, the USDA says; in the late 1980s, half were on farms with more than 80. Cattle in Kewaunee outnumber people 5 to 1, federal data show, compared with 2.5 to 1 in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger dairies produce more milk at a greater scale. Cows today are bigger than in the past, so they eat—and excrete—more. Milk production per cow more than doubled between 1970 and 2017, according to the USDA. Farmers are growing less alfalfa to feed their animals and more corn, which requires more nitrogen fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kinnard cows live around the clock in a 19-acre shed, milked every eight hours on a largely automated carousel. Trucks bring feed, fans chill the air and lights simulate day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tractor-trailers haul away manure to be spread on more than 10,000 acres nearby where Mr. Kinnard says his family grows corn and alfalfa as feed. In years past, they and other farmers applied manure in a more solid state. Now, they mix it with wastewater to create a liquid. Mr. Kinnard says changing regulations drove the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wagner, his neighbor with the tap-water problem, says growing up in the county prepared him for life amid farms when he moved back in 1996. “I knew I would smell manure,” he says. “But not every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He discovered his well water was contaminated after his daughter asked him to test it before she mixed baby formula. He found elevated levels of nitrate as well as coliform, bacteria indicating possible fecal contamination, and at times, E. coli. The nitrates climbed over time to as high as 39 parts per million, four times the EPA maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When snow melted in spring, he noticed starting in 2002, his water ran the color of lager. Mr. Wagner took his concerns to the Kinnards years ago, laying out his worries at their kitchen table. “They’ve gone above and beyond to try to do the right thing,” he says. “This took a long time to happen, and it’s going to take a long time to fix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among countermeasures Mr. Kinnard has taken: He plants cover crops such as oats and clover on about half his acres to soak up nutrients and put organic material back into the soil. He uses a swimming-pool-size pit of tree bark to filter nitrates from water flowing from his fields into culverts that lead toward Lake Michigan. He believes that system, essentially a man-made wetland, could help farmers across the Farm Belt mitigate nutrient runoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several peers operate digesters that reduce pathogens in manure and produce methane that can be burned to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Kewaunee residents say manure from growing dairy herds is too much for an area characterized by shallow soils and fractured bedrock called Silurian dolomite. A group of residents challenged a permit about seven years ago that let the Kinnards expand their farm more than 50% without what the residents felt were adequate water-quality protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They testified before administrative-law judge Jeffrey Boldt of Wisconsin’s Division of Hearings and Appeals in Green Bay that drinking polluted water made them sick. The judge in 2014 allowed the expansion but ordered the Kinnards to take protective measures including installing six monitoring wells at their cowshed and on fields where they spread manure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kinnard appealed. He says his family has worked for years to limit impact on groundwater and such regulations block him from experimenting with ways to improve his land and nearby waters. “My family lives next to these fields also,” he says. Other appeals followed, and a state appeals court on Wednesday asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take up the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kinnard and other farmers in Kewaunee say that there have been “brown water events” in the county for years and that what they are facing now is growing opposition from urban transplants with few ties to farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers in 2016 founded Peninsula Pride Farms, a group to address complaints about dairy’s impact and to share techniques for improving water and soil quality. Among those it helped was Erika Balza, who can see six dairy farms from her lawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night about two years ago, she says, she opened her bathroom faucet to a gush of muddy brown water smelling like manure. That hadn’t happened before. Tests revealed her well was contaminated with E. coli and other bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wsj-article-caption article__inset__image__caption&quot; itemprop=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-caption-content&quot;&gt;Water samples Ms. Balza collected about two years ago.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit article__inset__image__caption__credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit-tag&quot;&gt;Photo:&lt;/span&gt; Erika Balza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Balzas drilled a new well with state help. Last spring, tests revealed coliform bacteria and elevated nitrate levels. They treated the well with chlorine but don’t drink from it despite recent evidence it is bacteria-free. “You just can’t trust it,” says Ms. Balza, 48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peninsula Pride provided clean water to the Balzas for about six months after they discovered their well was polluted. The group is trying to balance the drive toward scale in the dairy industry and the impact on the land, says Don Niles, a dairy farmer and Peninsula Pride founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a greater chasm forming between farmers and nonfarmers,” he says. “We feel we can have both clean, healthy, safe drinking water and a thriving agricultural sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wagner has been drinking bottled water for years. In 2013, he spent $10,000 to drill a well that delivered clean water for roughly 16 months before it, too, became contaminated. His latest test, in October, showed his water remained unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was pretty naive. I thought you drilled a well and had good water,” he says. “Now I’m stuck with a $10,000 dirty hole in the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inkscape launches versions 0.92.4 and 1.0 alpha</title>
<link>https://inkscape.org/news/2019/01/17/inkscape-launches-version-0924/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://inkscape.org/news/2019/01/17/inkscape-launches-version-0924/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;postdate&quot;&gt;Jan. 17, 2019, 7:03 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkscape has launched version 0.92.4 with increased stability and bug fixes. This update delivers some notable performance improvements for extensions, filter rendering, saving and moving paths (with a live path effect), and the measure tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key improvements in this version will enable Inkscape users to do or experience the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align multiple objects as a group relative to a single object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write image data to standard output and read from it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience extensions working faster within complex documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See improved speed when deselecting a path with many nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ungroup text elements won’t result in changed font size of children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to print and / or print correct paper size with printers (especially Canon, EPSON, Konica Minolta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See improved performance of the measure tool when grids are visible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See proper opacity of partially transparent embedded bitmap images in PDF export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to Shift/Ctrl-click on control handles of shapes without crashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Inkscape with up-to-date poppler library 0.72.0 – useful for Mac users building with Homebrew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Translation and documentation updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Icelandic, Hungarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish user interface (UI) translations have been updated. Inkscape’s Ukranian and Hungarian documentation translations have also been revised in this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Join an Inkscape project team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkscape is always happy to welcome new contributors. You can help complete documentation, or you can translate various elements of the project into your language. If you would like to contribute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/contribute/&quot;&gt;head here&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help with writing news and social media outreach or website design, as a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/teams/*vectors&quot;&gt;Vectors&lt;/a&gt;. They are the marketing, outreach, and promotion team for Inkscape. Designers, artists, marketers, writers, and anyone enthusiastic about bringing Inkscape to more people in more places, is welcome to join. If you're an avid system administrator, your skills can be helpful to the project, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is always room for developers, too, especially those who can help with preparing the upcoming Inkscape 1.0 to be usable on MacOS. As few Inkscape volunteer developers use a Mac, the project needs someone who knows how to automatically package a .dmg file, to enable Mac users to test the alpha version, along with Mac equipment to run continuous integration jobs. In addition, the project could use help to do the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Program a great UI for some of the new features in 1.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix bugs and implement new features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrangle Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head here to &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/develop/&quot;&gt;find out more about joining the ranks&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inkscape development version 1.0 alpha seeking testers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.inkscape.org/media/resources/render/about_screen_alpha.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the project advances towards the release of version 1.0, the Inkscape teams are seeking users interested in testing the alpha version ahead of release. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0alpha0/&quot;&gt;Head here to download the alpha&lt;/a&gt;. For Linux users, there is a new AppImage available, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/probono/&quot;&gt;probono&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bug reporting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkscape is switching bug trackers. For new bugs, the project is going to use Gitlab's bug tracker. Most of the project's bug reports are currently still hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.lauchpad.net/inkscape&quot;&gt;launchpad&lt;/a&gt;, though. When you find an issue with the Alpha version, please check to see whether or not it has been reported on launchpad! If it has been reported, help us move it to GitLab! Add a link to the old bug report in the new bug tracker and help the project by summarizing any additional findings from the old bug report. New issues with the Inkscape program &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/issues/&quot;&gt;can be flagged here&lt;/a&gt;. Read up on detailed bug reporting instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/contribute/report-bugs/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/&quot;&gt;inkscape.org&lt;/a&gt; and the project's social media channels for the latest details. There may be something in store for those who wrangle bugs in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download version 0.92.4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/release/&quot;&gt;Get the latest packaged version&lt;/a&gt; from the Inkscape website or soon from the package manager that comes with your Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big '&lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;' to members of the Inkscape community, including donors and bug reporters, for all the work that has been put into these releases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;29.902849740933&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have a lot of sympathy for this approach, and of course you learn more by having fun and continuing, then being meticulous and stopping.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;However if at each fork, you choose the fun road, you might get a long way until you run out of options (which may be fine). But the terrible difficulty is necessary knowledge that is not explicitly stated. These gaps (&quot;mathematical maturity&quot;) are difficult to even identify, let alone fill. Story time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In high school, I missed a week or two, and later got stuck on a problem in calculus. Discussed it with the teacher, and he eventually seemed to see my difficulty was, but wouldn't tell me, instead saying &quot;you can work it out&quot;. I couldn't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Years later, I started asking online, and people responded helpfully, but didn't actually help. I read wikipedia and math websites about it. Watched videos about it, that were interesting and gave a new perspective, but didn't help my particular issue. I looked it up in famous textbooks (Spivak, Hardy), still nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Finally, I did all the problems in the derivatives section of Khan Academy, but when I came to this problem, it still didn't address my specific issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Thinking I had gaps in my knowledge, some known to me, and suspecting others unknown, I went back to even earlier material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Some time later, I reviewed the problem again, and realized that the issue was a completely trivial part of limits - an earlier section. Which was what I missed in those 2 weeks of high school, all those years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A nice maths teacher can save you years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;179.89644459786&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have some opinions on the question in the OP: I'm heavily self-taught from independent study in math; that study helped me with, and at times was part of my good career in, applied math and computing before my Ph.D. in pure/applied math and helped a lot for my Ph.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For a &lt;em&gt;curriculum&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(1) Do the standard high school math, Algebra I, Plane Geometry (based on proofs), Algebra II, Trigonometry, and Solid Geometry (based on proofs). In each of these, it is sufficient (A) to work most of the more challenging exercises and (B) try to think a little about what is going on. For (C), it would be good occasionally, say, 1-4 times a year, to chat about your progress with a good mathematician, Ph.D., likely a college prof. To find a Ph.D. who will give you an hour or so per visit, maybe do some &lt;em&gt;networking&lt;/em&gt;. If you don't like the first choice, e.g., if they are not encouraging and helpful, then try a different Ph.D. mathematician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(2) Do Analytic Geometry and Calculus. Use a good college textbook. Since highly polished texts have been widely available for decades, there's no need to pay big bucks for new copies of the latest. So get a good used text. Better yet, get 1-4 good texts, use your favorite one as your primary source and the others for more content, alternate descriptions, evidence of what is more/less important, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Sets: Now in an important sense, essentially all of math is heavily about &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;. For first calculus, you don't need to know much about sets; the following should be nearly sufficient:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;By 1900 or so, a lot of math was known, but there was a nagging, somewhat philosophical, question of what math really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. The answer of &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; math was to construct a &lt;em&gt;foundation&lt;/em&gt; in, say, the deep basement, that would answer the question but not much change the rest. The answer was to start with &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; and then define everything else in terms of sets. In particular do some somewhat tricky and obscure work to define some sets that look, work, walk, talk, etc. like the numbers on the line, the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; numbers. We don't think of the real numbers this way, but the effort addressed the philosophical question -- or, if I can get you to believe in sets, then I've got you for the rest of math. Much of the early work on sets was from G. Cantor. Yes, soon there were some issues from Bertrand Russell and then Kurt Gödel and, later, Paul Cohen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For a long time in math, you can regard a &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; as a conceptual (imaginary) collection of some kind, e.g., all the peas in a little jar in the back of the refrigerator, all the people with an iPhone, all the real numbers on the line, all the water molecules in the earth's oceans, all the parabolas, all the trials you might do in a lab experiment, and much more -- really, from the philosophical approach to what math &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for all of math. Or intuitively &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; are the containers for what we are thinking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Functions: Much of math is about &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;. E.g.,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, in &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; math, the function is f. The x is the &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; of the function, i.e., a &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; which is essentially always in math from,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &quot;Think of something; call it x.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;where at least in calculus usually the thing are thinking about is a number. Or, to &quot;solve for x&quot;, think&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &quot;I suspect there is a number such
     that these conditions hold; I want to
     find if there is such a number and if
     so what its actual numerical value
     is.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Now you understand what math means when it talks about variable x and function f. Then, given variable (e.g., number) x and function f, f(x) is the value of f at x.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;E.g., for this set stuff, a function gets defined in terms of sets, e.g., the set of all &lt;em&gt;ordered pairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     (x, f(x))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;for x in some set called the &lt;em&gt;domain&lt;/em&gt; of the function. In calculus, the domain is usually the set of real numbers, that is, the points on the number line (yes, that's not the tricky set theory definition of the real numbers).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, with the ordered pairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     (x, f(x))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;we have a very precise definition of a function in terms of sets (ordered pairs can also be defined in terms of sets).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Of course, in actual work, especially in applied math, nearly no one actually thinks of a function as a set of ordered pairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Completeness: There is an old joke, partly appropriate, that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &quot;Calculus is the elementary
     consequences of the completeness
     property of the real number system.&quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Intuitively &lt;em&gt;completeness&lt;/em&gt; is, if you are converging to something by more and more accurate approximations, then there really is something there for you to converge to. This property does NOT hold for the rational numbers -- the &lt;em&gt;rational numbers&lt;/em&gt; are all the numbers of the form (that can be written as) p/q for p and q integers (whole numbers) with q not zero. Why? E.g., can use the rational numbers to approximate as closely as we please the square root of 2, but the square root of 2 can't be a rational number. Why not? Because if the square root of 2 were rational, then we would also have for integers p and q, q not zero&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     (p/q)(p/q) = 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     (p)(p) = 2(q)(q)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So the left side has some even number (possibly 0) factors of 2 while the right side has an odd number of factors of 2, and this violates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that each integer can be factored in only one way as a product of prime numbers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Well, a big deal about the real numbers is that they are &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt;; i.e., intuitively, if something converges, then there is something to converge to. Completeness is a big deal because it generalizes, especially to Hilbert space that you may come to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, in calculus often we make approximations that can become as accurate as we please, and we want the completeness property to know that what these approximations approach, &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt;, can exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;E.g., with the real numbers, if we make more and more accurate approxomations to the square root of 2, then we know that our approximations will &lt;em&gt;converge&lt;/em&gt; to the actual square root of 2 which DOES exist as a real number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Sets get to be quite important in math in the last years of college math and beyond. But for calculus, nearly all of that subject, especially what learn in a first calculus course, was quite solid well before G. Cantor. So, in practice, when studying first calculus, we don't see much about sets. So, for first calculus, sets remain mostly a topic in the deep basement that addresses an old philosophical issue. So, for first calculus, sets are no big issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Analytic Geometry: Here you study the &lt;em&gt;conic sections&lt;/em&gt;. They are a bit amazing and important in physics, mechanical engineering, and more and something definite to work with while learning calculus. So, imagine a cone, say, an ice cream cone. Take two of them that are the same and put the points together so that they are both on the same &lt;em&gt;axis&lt;/em&gt; through the points (I'll let you get a precise definition of &lt;em&gt;axis&lt;/em&gt;). Now imagine a sharp sword, say, as in the old John Belushi Samurai Tailor skit and use the sword to slice the cones and look at the cut edges. Right, we assume that the sword moves in a plane. Depending on where you slice, you will get (A) just a point (where the two cones touch together), (B) two lines crossed as in an X (the cross in the X is at the point where the two cones come together), (C) a circle (we are awash in circles), (D) a parabola (to a fairly good approximation, a grand slam baseball follows a parabola), (E) an ellipse (to a quite good approximation, each planet goes around the sun in an ellipse), (E) the two parts of a hyperbola (an electron shot at a negative charge will follow one of the halves of a hyperbola as it avoids the negative charge).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;First Calculus in a Nutshell: Then for first calculus, there are two big topics, differentiation and integration. Differentiation is finding rate of change, intuitively the slope (as in high school algebra) of a tangent line to the graph of a curve (defined in terms of a function with domain some or all of the real numbers). E.g., for time t, let d(t) be the function that gives us our distance from home at time t. Then the derivative of function d at time t is the velocity, say, function v, at time t. So, in a car, the odometer gives d and the speedometer gives v. That is, at time t we have traveled distance d(t) and are moving a velocity v(t). Here to be simple, I do not make a careful distinction between what physics calls speed versus velocity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What differentiation does, integration reverses, undoes. So, we can use integration on function v to recover function d. We have now introduced the fundamental theorem of calculus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Right, v is the function, and v(t) is its value at time t, but in first calculus it is common to drop the distinction between v and v(t) and just say &quot;the function v(t)&quot; and mostly avoid mentioning v by itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;201.87676915569&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Again, for &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; t, think&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &quot;There is a number; call it t&quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That approach to the meaning of a &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; works well enough for essentially all of math.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Calculus was invented mostly by I. Newton, mostly for physics, especially for explaining the motions of the planets. Since then calculus has become a pillar of civilization, especially Western Civilization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Mostly in calculus, integration is finding the area (or more carefully &lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt; the area) under a curve, maybe a parabola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But can also have a &lt;em&gt;line integral&lt;/em&gt;, say, the work do when carrying 100 pounds of hay to the top of the hay loft of the barn. Here we integrate from beginning to end of the work. If we let the hay fall, then neglecting friction, etc. get the work back as energy. So, have to pay attention to the direction of the integration, from the ground up to the hay loft or from the hay loft back to the ground. The two values have opposite signs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You can teach yourself calculus: Just get 1-4, at least one good calculus texts and dig in -- read the chapters, follow the material, work nearly all the more difficult exercises, and maybe check 1-4 times a year with a good mathematician. I did that for freshman college calculus (but didn't check with anyone). I never took the course and, instead, started on sophomore calculus and made As. No problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(3) Linear Algebra. Likely the next course would be linear algebra. It would be good to do this subject 2-4 times from more elementary treatments to some of the more advanced material. Some of the more advanced material can cover linear programming optimization, classic two person game theory, the proof of the Nash result in game theory, some treatments of the fast Fourier transform in digital signal processing, group representations in the quantum mechanics of molecular spectroscopy, error correcting codes in algebraic coding theory, numerical methods, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The start of linear algebra is just one or several &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; equations in one or several variables. E.g., for two equations in three variables, &lt;em&gt;unknowns:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2x + 3y - 6z = 0

     5x - 2y + 7z = 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For positive integers (whole numbers) m and n, given m such &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; equations in n variables (&lt;em&gt;unknowns&lt;/em&gt;), the number of solutions, depending also on the numerical constants in the equations, is none, one, or infinitely many.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The main way to find all the solutions is just Gauss elimination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That covers a good chunk of a first course in linear algebra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The notation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2x + 3y - 6z = 0

     5x - 2y + 7z = 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;gets to be clumsy so we write instead&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2 + 3 - 6

     5 - 2 + 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;write that with big, square brackets, and call it a &lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; with two rows and three columns. The individual numbers are &lt;em&gt;components&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, a matrix is conceptually close to an array with two subscripts common in programming languages. Maybe we call the matrix&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2 + 3 - 6

     5 - 2 + 7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A. Since matrix A has 2 rows and 3 columns, we say that it is 2 x 3 (&quot;2 by 3&quot;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Then we write the x, y, z in a column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     x

     y

     z
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;apply the big, square brackets, and call it a matrix with 3 rows and 1 column and maybe call it v. We write the right side&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     0

     3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;also with brackets, and maybe call it b.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Then we define a product, a &lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; product Av so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     Av = b
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;means just the same as&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2x + 3y - 6z = 0

     5x - 2y + 7z = 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;From then on we work with matrices and try to avoid notation like&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     2x + 3y - 6z = 0

     5x - 2y + 7z = 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In this way, a course in &lt;em&gt;linear algebra&lt;/em&gt; is commonly called a course, Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A matrix with just one column is a &lt;em&gt;column vector&lt;/em&gt;; with just one row, a &lt;em&gt;row vector&lt;/em&gt;. In short, either is called a &lt;em&gt;vector&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Linearity: Given m x n matrices A and B, m x 1 matrices u, v, and real numbers c, d, we have that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     A(cu + dv) = cAu + dAv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Here we regard Au as case of function A with argument u. That is, we could have said that matrix A defines function f so that&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     f(u) = Au
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;With&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     cA + dA
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;we form &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; cA and dA and &lt;em&gt;sums&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     cA + dA
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, we have to define both of those: The definitions are close to just obvious.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The equation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     A(cu + dv) = cAu + dAv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;means that matrix A acts like a &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; function. Big deal! The real world is awash in linear behavior, and linearity is an enormously powerful property mathematically. The rest of linear algebra and matrix theory is nearly all about the consequences of such linearity.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The fundamental theorem of algebra is that each (high school style) polynomial in variable x can be uniquely factored into a product of terms of the form (ax + b) where the a and b are possibly complex numbers. Essentially from this fact, the more advanced parts of linear algebra use the complex numbers and not just the real numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the end of a second course in linear algebra, will pay attention to the essentially geometrical notions of length and angle and, in particular, to orthogonality, that is, perpendicular. Big topics are the Gram-Schmidt process where find some orthogonal vectors and the polar decomposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The polar decomposition result says that a matrix acting on a circle will yield an ellipse, that is, for matrix A and vector u, if we let u take on the values of all the points on a circle, then the Au will generate all the values of all the points on an ellipse. The ellipse has two axes, and they are mutually perpendicular. So, if have the vectors of the two axes, then have enough to construct the whole ellipse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In linear algebra, this situation generalizes to any finite dimension and yields the singular value decomposition, principle components, factor analysis, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;With more advanced work, this situation becomes the spectral theory of self-adjoint linear operatiors central to quantum mechanics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(4) The Four Main Parts of Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are four main parts of math:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(A) Foundations, that is, deep in the basement with set theory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(B) Algebra, as in high school, the integers, prime numbers, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, greatest common divisor and least common multiple, the fundamental theorem of algebra, linear algebra and matrix theory, the generalizations of number systems such as groups, rings, fields (the rational, real, and complex numbers are all &lt;em&gt;fields&lt;/em&gt; but so is the set of integers modulo a prime number), etc. Fermat's last theorem, settled by A. Wiles, is part of algebra; so are the deep, difficult questions about prime numbers, etc. There are applications in error correcting codes and cryptography.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(C) Geometry, e.g., high school plane geometry, analytic geometry, and differential geometry, a deep subject important for relativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(D) Analysis, as in calculus, differential equations, functional analysis, e.g., Banach and Hilbert spaces, partial differential equations, e.g., as in Maxwell's equations, fluid flow, and relativity, probability, statistics, stochastic processes, optimization, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In differential equations we are given an equation with the derivatives of some function and want to find the function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;E.g., for real valued function y(t) and constants k and b, we might have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     y(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At one time, that little differential equation saved FedEx from going out of business. The solution is a &lt;em&gt;lazy&lt;/em&gt; S curve and a first cut at &lt;em&gt;viral&lt;/em&gt; growth.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There is topology which is partly in geometry and analysis. The main idea of topology is &lt;em&gt;continuity&lt;/em&gt;, that is, changing without sudden jumps or some cases of wildly fast oscillations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There is algebraic geometry partly in algebra and geometry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Much of number theory has deep connections with analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Much of linear algebra is an introduction to functional analysis in analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The older applied math is mostly analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(5) Analysis. Usually after linear algebra will study &lt;em&gt;advanced calculus&lt;/em&gt; and analysis. Broadly there are two approaches, (A) theory and (B) applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The theory is mostly to give fully careful proofs of the results and first generalizations of what you saw in calculus. For the theory maybe the most respected text is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;R. Rudin, &lt;em&gt;Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Third Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For this, get the third edition and not either of the two earlier editions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, will discover that the integral learned in calculus is called the Riemann integral because B. Riemann made the theorems solid. Rudin also does the easy generalization to the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;115.88273352204&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Part III&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Rudin has a nice chapter on Fourier series, that is, representing a periodic function f(t) with a sum of e^(iwt) for &lt;em&gt;overtones&lt;/em&gt; at frequencies w and where each frequency w is a whole number multiple of a &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; frequency. The linear algebra and geometry here are that the e^(iwt) are perpendicular projections of the f(t). So, the e^(iwt) are orthogonal axes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The line integral generalizes to the exterior calculus of differential forms (keep track of signs from the direction do the integrations, i.e., as in line integrals) and the fundamental theorem of calculus generalizes to Stokes theorem crucial in Maxwell's equations, fluid flow, and partial differential equations. Now we are close to differential geometry, and Rudin also does the inverse and implicit function theorems important in differential geometry and parts of nonlinear optimization, e.g., Lagrange multipliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I warmly suggest that take a really fun, one weekend, pass through Stokes theorem parts of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Tom M. Apostol, &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus&lt;/em&gt;, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1957.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Get it used, and pay whatever you have to. This way get to see the 2-3 dimensional versions and, really, mostly enough for what physics and engineering do with &lt;em&gt;vector analysis&lt;/em&gt; and Stokes theorem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In H. Royden, &lt;em&gt;Real Analysis&lt;/em&gt; and the first half of W. Rudin, &lt;em&gt;Real and Complex Analysis&lt;/em&gt;, can see the Lebesgue integral, due to H. Lebesgue near 1900. In essentially all cases where the Riemann integral is defined, the Lebesgue integral is also defined and gives the same numerical value. But the Lebesgue integral has more powerful theorems and is defined in more general situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As in a 1933 paper of A. Kolmogorov, the Lebesgue integral gives a solid foundation to probability, statistics, and stochastic processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In W. Rudin, &lt;em&gt;Functional Analysis&lt;/em&gt; get a treatment of &lt;em&gt;distributions&lt;/em&gt; that cleans up what physics tries to do with the Dirac delta function and also covers spectral theory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;From there, can go for a Ph.D. For that will need mostly (A) pass the qualifying exams and (B) do some original research. The standards are commonly something like &quot;an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication&quot; and for publication, &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For the qualifying exams, first pick a department, pure/applied math or some math area in engineering, optimization, probability, economics, computer science, etc., get their description of their qualifying exam topics and references, study, and take and pass the exams. For the research, do some.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;One suggestion: For the research, pick a real problem and use some math, at least in part new, to get a good solution. Can get &quot;significant&quot; from the importance of the real problem. Can get much of &quot;new&quot; if have the first or better attack on the real problem. Can get &quot;correct&quot; if do the math with careful theorems and proofs. Can publish if pick an appropriate journal. Might get to regard the math as &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; based on what it does for the real problem and not just its contribution to pure math.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Even the best US grad schools are hungry for good students. With a good ugrad math major and good work on independent study, should get a good reception at grad schools and at least a tuition scholarship. In that way I got accepted to grad school at math departments at Cornell, Brown, Princeton, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In a sense, independent study is recommended: (A) That is basically what research profs have to do for all their careers. (B) At least at one time the math department at Princeton stated that no courses were offered for preparation for the qualifying exams, students were expected to prepare for the exams on their own, courses were introductions to research by experts in their fields, and students should have some research underway in their first year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For a little on how to do the original parts of math research, there is the A. Wiles comment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly it's all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you go into the next dark room ....&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That's some of how to learn some math, largely with independent study, and maybe to get a Ph.D. But you might want more: You might want your Ph.D. work to get you a good start on a good career in pure/applied math research/applications. For that, look around, pick up what you can in seminars and conferences, and get what your profs can explain to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Broad point: Long the best opportunities in applied math, even with some advanced pure math prerequisites, have been in US national security, especially within 100 miles of the Washington Monument.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;58.784456991033&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm working on this myself and while I'm not very far along, I can share my approach.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. Go to Youtube, find the Professor Leonard channel. He teaches math at Merced College and is a very good lecturer. He has recorded himself teaching everything from pre-algebra through differential equations, and a statistics class. The one thing he has not done yet is linear algebra, he he apparently plans to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2. Watch his stuff, and supplement that with the corresponding &quot;Schaum's Outline&quot; or similar book for the topic at hand. Also, if you desire, buy a few editions old used college textbook for the corresponding topic. This gives you more exercises to do and a reference to consult if anything is unclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3. As desired, follow the Khan Academy lessons on the topic you're studying. KA has everything from arithmetic / pre-algebra up through at least Calculus and Linear Algebra. I don't remember offhand if they cover Differential Equations or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;4. For Linear Algebra in particular, the Gilbert Strang lectures on Youtube are very highly regarded, and he has a text that was written specifically to accompany those videos. So that's a good resource for Linear Algebra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;5. For &quot;higher&quot; math (real analysis, complex analysis, topology, abstract algebra, etc.) you can almost always find complete lecture series on Youtube / OCW. Depending on the topic, there may also be a &quot;Schaum's Outline&quot; or similar study guide book you can supplement with. And you can always find a used textbook on Amazon, usually for not too much money if you go with an older edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You can also find a lot of freely available maths texts online. See, for example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you don't have a background in doing proofs, which is kind of regarded as the dividing line between &quot;simple&quot; math and &quot;higher&quot; math, there are a number of books on that specific topic, including texts written for so-called &quot;transition to higher math&quot; classes. Some of those are freely available online as well. There's also a good class you can find on Youtube, &quot;Math for Computer Scientists&quot; which covers proofs and what-not pretty well. There's a freely available corresponding text as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Another thing to do is consult forums where you can ask for help if you get stuck. There is math.stackexchange.com, physicsforums.com, cheatatmathhomework.reddit.com, learnmath.reddit.com, mathhelp.reddit.com, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Somewhere I have a Google doc that lists a lot of the resources I have been using, and have queued up to use in the future. If anybody is interested, I'll clean that up, and make it public and share the link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;One last note: I haven't done it myself, but I've heard that if you live near a University, it's not too hard to find maths students who will tutor you to pick up some extra cash. So that's an option as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Edit: somebody else mentioned 3blue1brown on Youtube, and there are a number of other really good Youtube channels, including: Prof RobBob, NancyPi, and Dr. Chris Tisdell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;92.917127071823&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What is the purpose of a proof? You may think that it's intended to solve a problem, but that's really only half the point. A good proof is one that communicates your solution to other people.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Mathematical writing is hard to learn well under the best of circumstances, but if you don't have someone else giving you feedback on whether they understand what you're writing, it's absolutely impossible. You need to have a mentor or at least an editor at some point. That's not impossible to find outside of the university system, but it's very difficult.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(This is the single biggest reason why MOOCs for higher math haven't taken off. There are a lot of people who'd love to communicate something about the field that they've dedicated their lives to, but the feedback system just doesn't scale. If anyone can figure out how to fix that, it'll be a game changer.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So the first thing you have to do is to figure out what you can reasonably expect to get out of this process. You can learn the definitions and theorems of higher math, and that might be enough, but you're never going to develop an intuition for them without understanding how to produce proofs on your own. And don't fool yourself into thinking that you can evaluate your own proofs. It just doesn't work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If all of that doesn't have you turned off, then here are some ideas on what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A university level math curriculum is split into roughly three components: * Lower level classes that focus on basic definitions and calculations; * Mid level classes that teach some basic theorem-proving skills in subjects that are useful for people in other quantitative fields; * Upper level classes that offer serious practice in theorem-proving as well as the core ideas of mathematics. You don't generally have to do classes in any particular order, but you do have to master the skills of each level before you go on to the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To begin, you must be very comfortable with the contents of a high school math curriculum. Serge Lang's book on basic mathematics is a great refresher if you're not, or you can use any of the various popular study guides (Schaum's, Barron's, etc.).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the first level, you have calculus. This is generally split into three semesters, with the first dedicated to limits and derivatives of single-variable functions, one dedicated to integrals of single-variable functions as well as sequences and series, and the last dedicated to derivatives and integrals of multivariate functions. There are plenty of very expensive books with glossy page and many color pictures and few ideas, but if you want a serious introduction, look at Peter Lax's books on calculus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the second level you'll almost always find introductions to differential equations and linear algebra. Differential equations have historically been the workhorse of applied mathematics and you really need to have some familiarity with them, but I've never seen a book on the topic that I liked. I probably won't be satisfied by anything at this level, though, so look around and see if you can at least find something inexpensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Linear algebra is a more recent topic (with many of its key ideas actually originating in the 20th century), but it's probably actually more important now. Gilbert Strang's books are popular and are worth reading for a first look, but you really can't regard them as a serious introduction to the mathematical side of the topic. Axler is probably the best book in that regard, but it's best taken on a second pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think that probability should be regarded as a core class at this level. I don't think that's a fringe view, but it's not as universal as I'd like. I learned from Pitman's book, and I think it's as good as any to start with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You can also take classes on complex variables or &quot;discrete math&quot; here. I don't know what a good textbook for complex variables is--maybe Saff &amp;amp; Snider?--but I'm sure there are recommendations out there. Needham's &quot;Visual Complex Analysis&quot; is a fantastic book, but maybe not really suitable for a very first introduction. As for &quot;discrete math&quot; (a jumble of topics from logic, combinatorics and number theory), find the cheapest book you can get that has decent reviews on Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the third level, there are three main topics: analysis, algebra and topology/geometry. You can think of these as the three main viewpoints in higher math, and other topics being populated by people who primarily look at things with the tools of one of those three topics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Analysis starts out as the theory behind calculus. In a first course, you'll revisit a lot of what you saw in single-variable calculus, but you'll learn why it's true rather than just how to use it. For a single semester undergraduate course, Ken Binmore's book is probably the gentlest introduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Modern geometry is related to what you studied in high school, but with a few more centuries of development. It also doesn't get a lot of coverage at the undergraduate level, which is highly unfortunate. Stillwell's &quot;The Four Pillars of Geometry&quot; is a wonderful book and completely accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Algebra is a bit difficult to explain without getting into the weeds. Pinter's &quot;A Book of Abstract Algebra&quot; is very good at motivating the topic and explaining the basics, which is the best you can hope for in an introductory textbook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Beyond that but still at the undergraduate level, you can get electives in combinatorics (use Brualdi), number theory (?), logic (?) and some applied topics as well. Looking through the course offerings of various math departments will help you to fill in what the other possibilities are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;52.693410462777&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;79.89888776542&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You first need to define your boundaries and limits. Don't get me wrong, but mathematics is grinding, and if you think you have an idea where you're getting yourself into because you've studied calculus and algebra as an undergrad CS, you will fail miserably. Don't make the same mistake I did :)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Undergrad math is tooling; I like to use the analogy that it's like entering a workshop where you have all the tools available, but you're blindfolded, and you have no idea what each stuff is used for. So you'll have to touch everything. Look down for the tooling advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;When venturing in Mathematics, for your own sanity, please have an objective in mind. I'm down serious! Understand what you want to research and go in that direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;One last piece, Find a mentor, share, talk to people. You won't advance from yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As a piece of tooling advice, I have the following I've stolen from Reddit a few years ago (sorry I haven't found the source to it) __ TOOLING __ First of all, most important, GO LEARN ALGEBRA. Seriously, I know you think its bullshit but its the most basic skill in some ways that any mathematician should know. Second learn Calculus: Single and Multivariable. If you are still interested here are some things to go onto next:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Discrete mathematics: This includes equivalence relations (probably one of the most important things for you understand ever), propositional calculus (logic) proof techniques (induction) and some basic combinatorics (Pigeonhole principle). You can literally find any textbook and start reading. The theory is kinda a hodgepodge, but those are the major themes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Linear Algebra: Again, one of the most important subjects you will ever study. Once you understand this, you are really on your way, and this stuff comes up everywhere. Many mathematicians have said many of the biggest proofs in the world come down to &quot;just some linear algebra&quot;. The major point here is to understand that there is only one vector space for each dimension over a field and understand how a linear transformation becomes a matrix only after a choice of basis. Here equivalence relations come up again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Differential equations: Unless you're focused on engineering math or serious applied stuff, don't worry too much about this. Seriously, it's not that integral (haha get it!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Complex Analysis: Yes, mathematicians and Engr. Actually, do study &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers, but there is nothing imaginary here. This is serious stuff, do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Okay, so now you're about as a sophomore/junior level place in mathematics. How to finish it off? It's not that unclear:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Abstract Algebra -- Grab any book read about groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and modules. Proofs will be difficult here but work through it. There are so many books here, avoid Lang (good book but not for starting out), Dummit/Foote is okay. As a undergrad I had a good time with Rotman's An introduction to abstract algebra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Analysis -- Grab Baby Rudin. No seriously, Grab this book, sit in a room for a semester and just fuckn' read it. You will basically be &quot;redoing&quot; calculus. This is a trial by fire, go!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Topology -- Grab Introduction to Topology by J. Munkries. Its so well written it might as well be a coffee table book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There now, you have done everything a math major would. Yes, there are lots of things that are missing, arguably the most important things depending on what your goals are. Typically one studies Number Theory along with Abstract Algebra, or studies Analysis and Differential Equations together or Analysis and Topology. Seeing the links across different topics is essential, but I'm just giving the overview here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not every mathematician studies logic, and there are LOT of fringe topics that I'm omitting (including some of my favs: Projective Geometry, Varieties, Lattice/Order theory, Combinatorics, Elliptic Curves, Coding theory, Harmonic Analysis, etc.). However, none of these are required courses at more than a 1% of programs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

<title>773M Password ‘Megabreach’ Is Years Old</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/01/773m-password-megabreach-is-years-old/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My inbox and Twitter messages positively lit up today with people forwarding stories from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/collection-one-breach-email-accounts-passwords/?mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wired&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other publications about a supposedly new trove of nearly 773 million unique email addresses and 21 million unique passwords that were posted to a hacking forum. A story in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/17/breached-data-largest-collection-ever-seen-email-password-hacking?CMP=fb_a-technology_b-gdntech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; breathlessly dubbed it “the largest collection ever of breached data found.” But in an interview with the apparent seller, KrebsOnSecurity learned that it is not even close to the largest gathering of stolen data, and that it is at least two to three years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dump, labeled “&lt;strong&gt;Collection #1&lt;/strong&gt;” and approximately 87GB in size, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first detailed&lt;/a&gt; earlier today by &lt;strong&gt;Troy Hunt&lt;/strong&gt;, who operates the &lt;strong&gt;HaveIBeenPwned&lt;/strong&gt; breach notification service. Hunt said the data cache was likely “made up of many different individual data breaches from literally thousands of different sources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity sought perspective on this discovery from &lt;strong&gt;Alex Holden&lt;/strong&gt;, CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.holdsecurity.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hold Security&lt;/a&gt;, a company that specializes in trawling underground spaces for intelligence about malicious actors and their stolen data dumps. Holden said the data appears to have first been posted to underground forums in October 2018, and that it is just a subset of a much larger tranche of passwords being peddled by a shadowy seller online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot of a subset of that seller’s current offerings, which total almost &lt;em&gt;1 Terabyte&lt;/em&gt; of stolen and hacked passwords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_46291&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/collection1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46291&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/collection1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;618&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The 87GB “Collection1” archive is one of but many similar tranches of stolen passwords being sold by a particularly prolific ne’er-do-well in the underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see above, Collection #1 offered by this seller is indeed 87GB in size. He also advertises a &lt;strong&gt;Telegram&lt;/strong&gt; username where he can be reached — “&lt;strong&gt;Sanixer&lt;/strong&gt;.” So, naturally, KrebsOnSecurity contacted Sanixer via Telegram to find out more about the origins of Collection #1, which he is presently selling for the bargain price of just $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanixer said Collection#1 consists of data pulled from a huge number of hacked sites, and was not exactly his “freshest” offering. Rather, he sort of steered me away from that archive, suggesting that — unlike most of his other wares — Collection #1 was at least 2-3 years old. His other password packages, which he said are not all pictured in the above screen shot and total more than 4 terabytes in size, are less than a year old, Sanixer explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of explaining the provenance of Collection #1, Sanixer said it was a mix of “dumps and leaked bases,” and then he offered an interesting screen shot of his additional collections. Click on the image below and notice the open Web browser tab behind his purloined password trove (which is apparently stored at Mega.nz): Troy Hunt’s published research on this 773 million Collection #1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_46292&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sanixer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46292&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sanixer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Sanixer says Collection #1 was from a mix of sources. A description of those sources can be seen in the directory tree on the left side of this screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holden said the habit of collecting large amounts of credentials and posting it online is not new at all, and that the data is far more useful for things like phishing, blackmail and other indirect attacks — as opposed to plundering inboxes. Holden added that his company had already derived 99 percent of the data in Collection #1 from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was popularized several years ago by Russian hackers on various Dark Web forums,” he said. “Because the data is gathered from a number of breaches, typically older data, it does not present a direct danger to the general user community. Its sheer volume is impressive, yet, by account of many hackers the data is not greatly useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core reason so many accounts get compromised is that far too many people have the nasty habit(s) of choosing poor passwords, re-using passwords and email addresses across multiple sites, and not taking advantage of multi-factor authentication options when they are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this Collection #1 has you spooked, changing your password(s) certainly can’t hurt — unless of course you’re in the habit of re-using passwords. Please don’t do that. As we can see from the offering above, your password is probably worth way more to you than it is to cybercriminals (in the case of Collection #1, just .000002 cents per password).&lt;span id=&quot;more-46290&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, by far the most important passwords are those protecting our email inbox(es). That’s because in nearly all cases, the person who is in control of that email address can reset the password of any services or accounts tied to that email address – merely by requesting a password reset link via email. For more on this dynamic, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Value of a Hacked Email Account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_21036&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-21036&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;596&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1.jpg 742w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1-285x158.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HE-1-600x333.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Your email account may be worth far more than you imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of thinking about passwords, consider using &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt;, lengthy passphrases — collections of words in an order you can remember — when a site allows it. In general, a long, unique passphrase takes far more effort to crack than a short, complex one. Unfortunately, many sites do not let users choose passwords or passphrases that exceed a small number of characters, or they will otherwise allow long passphrases but ignore anything entered after the character limit is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are the type of person who likes to re-use passwords, then you definitely need to be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-password-managers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a password manager,&lt;/a&gt; which helps you pick and remember strong and unique passwords/passphrases and essentially lets you use the same strong master password/passphrase across all Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;17 Jan 2019&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A library that I work on often these days, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer&quot;&gt;meshoptimizer&lt;/a&gt;, has changed over time to use fewer and fewer C++ library features, up until the current state where the code closely resembles C even though it uses some C++ features. There have been many reasons behind the changes - dropping C++11 requirement allowed me to make sure anybody can compile the library on any platform, removing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; substantially improved performance of unoptimized builds, removing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;algorithm&lt;/code&gt; includes sped up compilation. However, I’ve never quite taken the leap all the way to C with this codebase. Today we’ll explore the gamut of possible C++ implementations for one specific algorithm, mesh simplifier, henceforth known as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, and see if going all the way to C is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesh simplifier is an implementation of an edge collapse quadric based simplification algorithm with many tweaks to improve performance and quality of the result. The algorithm is still in development but has had a fair share of effort put into it. The details are really not that important, but it helps to understand the structure and size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The entire algorithm is implemented in one standalone .cpp file that has almost exactly a thousand lines of code (1004 as of this writing), including comments, blank lines, lines with braces, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The algorithm almost exclusively uses heap-allocated arrays as data structures, using raw pointers for this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The algorithm needs a hash table and a sorting routine, implemented from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will look at several variations of the implementation, starting with one that uses C++ containers and algorithms that would be helpful for that algorithm, then remove one C++ feature at a time and measure compilation speed and runtime performance as we go on three compilers, gcc 7.3, clang 6 and msvc 2017 on Core i7-8700K running Windows 10 / Ubuntu 16.10. We’ll measure compilation performance by just compiling one .cpp file (with default options in debug and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-O2&lt;/code&gt; optimization level in release), and measure runtime performance by simplifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buddha.obj&lt;/code&gt; (1M triangle mesh) to 25% of its size. After we reach the current implementation, we will explore the option of changing the code to pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the way I arrived at these implementations is by taking the code you can see in the repository right now, and changing it to be more idiomatic Modern C++&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;. However, these are generally very close to past versions of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; - the difference being that it’s possible to directly compare the variants now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version we’re starting with is the original &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/c93ba0987baa84bd73b61edf1c0ba7ba2e48df4b/src/simplifier.cpp&quot;&gt;current meshoptimizer master&lt;/a&gt;, with the following modifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All raw pointers changed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of a home-grown hash table we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::unordered_set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of a home-grown sorting routine we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the performance that we’re getting as a result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;520 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;646 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2273 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;572 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;684 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2356 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;566 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;725 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1535 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;584 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;422 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;566 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36317 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;579 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a good starting point. We can see that performance is pretty solid in release - 0.6 seconds to decimate 1M triangle mesh is a good level of performance - generally more or less reasonable in debug with a notable exception of MSVC (the adverse behavior of MSVC STL in debug mode was one of the forcing functions to remove all STL use from meshoptimizer), and compile times generally vary but are uninspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the compile times in perspective, Jonathan Blow recently posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/iD08Vpkie8Q?t=4984&quot;&gt;video stream with compiler performance improvements&lt;/a&gt;, where his game engine and game written in his new language compile and link in about a second (compilation itself takes about 0.9 seconds). That’s on a codebase that has 100K lines of code - our algorithm only has 1K lines of code (excluding STL, of course - it’s not entirely fair to exclude STL, but it’s not entirely fair to include STL either since we know our algorithm can be implemented in 1K LOC without any STL dependencies). 400 ms is something you notice when compiling your code, even if it’s just one file, and something that makes me less happy when working on the code - given many files like that, cumulative compilation performance can be bad. This is given the fact that our implementation is pretty spartan about the STL dependencies - we only use three algorithms/containers. Let’s see what happens when we stop using one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret about the previous version we benchmarked is that it never existed in that form. While meshoptimizer initially used STL containers and algorithms, it never used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::unordered_set&lt;/code&gt; - that’s because based on prior experience I expected the performance to be insufficient for the kinds of algorithms I wanted to write, and had a custom replacement that was using quadratic probing in a large power of two sized array, which is similar to Google’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dense_hash_set&lt;/code&gt; design. It’s a kind of hash table I use and implement often in different codebases for different applications, so I’m very familiar with it. The implementation in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; is just 35 lines of code&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, so it’s easy to drop in and adapt for the use case at hand. Let’s see what happens when we use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;334 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;461 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2054 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;460 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;270 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;517 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2152 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;452 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;314 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;609 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1179 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;415 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;361 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;461 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28337 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;380 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like the extra 35 lines for a manual implementation of a better hash table were worth it. We’re seeing significant performance improvements across the board, in debug/release and both in terms of compile time and run time. The largest increase in runtime performance is on MSVC, we got 1.5x faster, and this is given the fact that hash table isn’t used as a core part of the algorithm - it’s only used to establish uniqueness relationship between individual vertices before the algorithm starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights the poor fit of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::unordered_set&lt;/code&gt; to performance-critical workloads, especially ones that are insert-heavy. Unfortunately, this is not an implementation defect and thus is not possible to correct - the issue is that the standard requirements on unordered containers preclude more efficient implementations. Here’s to hoping that eventually we’ll get a better hash table in the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point during development of the simplifier repeated profiling of various meshes showed that a lot of time is being spent in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt;. Now, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; isn’t the fastest sorting algorithm, but it’s generally extremely competitive with custom implementations and it’s hard to beat without changing the problem around. In my case, sorting was used on an array of edge collapses, with the sort key being a floating point error value - so the natural instinct is to use a 3-pass radix sort, using 11, 11 and 10 bits of the key in each pass. However, there’s an interesting alternative available to us here - we can do radix sort in a single pass, using an 11 bit key&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens is that we have a 32-bit non-negative floating point value; if we take the top 12 bits and ignore the topmost one (since that’s a sign bit and is always 0), we get 11 bits that represent 8 bits of exponent and 3 bits of mantissa, which essentially gives us a value of similar magnitude but a significant round-off error. If we sort using this value as a key, as a result the sorting sequence isn’t going to be perfectly ordered with respect to the full 32-bit key. However, in our case we need to sort to be able to process better edge collapses first based on a heuristic - and the heuristic is a gross approximation so the extra error our sorting introduces is not noticeable. This technique is surprisingly useful in other domains where you don’t necessarily need an exact order either. A benefit of a single-pass radix sort is that it’s faster (you only need to do one pass over the data instead of 3!) and simpler to implement than a full-blown radix sort, taking just 36 lines of code&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;287 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;403 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;949 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;334 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;230 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;461 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;962 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;327 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;312 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;546 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;940 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;328 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;330 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;430 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26824 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;285 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time the gains in compilation times are somewhat more modest. We’ve removed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;algorithm&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; header but it doesn’t seem so have had very significant benefits to compilation time - we’re still including &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and it’s possible that large STL headers are pulled by both. However, the effects on performance are very significant, especially on debug performance in libstdc++ (most likely &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; is very slow in debug there) but the gains in release builds are also exciting. What is not obvious from this graph is that sorting got so much faster that it almost completely disappeared from the profiles compared to the other work - the entire algorithm runs “just” 1.35x faster, but the gains measured on just the sorting code are much larger, 117 ms -&amp;gt; 10 ms in release builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One number that we haven’t moved substantially yet is the time it takes to run this code in debug using MSVC. While it’s natural to expect unoptimized builds to be slower than optimized, they have to be fast enough. Sometimes you want to debug your problem on a non-trivial input dataset. Sometimes you want to run the debug build with full checks through your tests to make sure they don’t trigger any bugs that could disappear in release. Sometimes you are trying to debug a different part of the program, but you still need to run the rest of it. Programmers creatively come up with many workarounds that make the problem less severe - you can make special builds that enable some optimizations but not all, you can use mixed optimization settings for different projects, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#pragma optimize&lt;/code&gt; to temporarily disable optimizations around offending parts of the code - but all of these seem like duct-tape. Let’s try to replace the only STL component we’re still using, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;, with a really simple dynamic array - we don’t need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; in our code, all arrays are initialized with the right size. Our demands are low enough that our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; replacement is just 40 lines of code&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;, and mostly consists of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;operator[]&lt;/code&gt; definitions ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;158 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;303 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;980 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;318 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;138 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;320 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1021 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;297 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;142 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;324 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1028 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;299 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;156 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;219 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3482 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;265 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is certainly… interesting. By replacing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; with our own type we not only significantly improved debug performance in MSVC, but also halved the compile time for several compilers we were testing. Debug performance in gcc/clang regressed a bit - I believe this is because my replacement uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; to perform bounds checking on every &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;operator[]&lt;/code&gt; access, and in libc++ and libstdc++ these are controlled using separate defines, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_LIBCPP_DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Enabling these defines for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; variant increases the debug runtime performance to ~1350 ms for both libraries&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt;, so our replacement &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; faster when comparable functionality is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release performance also slightly increased across the board - this is because for many of our arrays, the default initialization performed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;’s constructor is redundant as we’re going to fill the array anyway. With &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;, you can either &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/code&gt; a large array and then compute the items (which requires default-initializing every item redundantly), or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly (which requires a bit more code for adding each item, and this overhead can also add up). With a custom container it’s easy to have an option to skip initialization - in fact, in our replacement that’s the only option since it’s easy to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt; the array manually if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A custom container with bounds checking &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;operator[]&lt;/code&gt; was mostly a success, but it didn’t quite make me happy. In some algorithms the extra cost of the container was still pretty substantial. In some algorithms internal functions would use raw pointers to maximize release performance, which meant bounds checking isn’t performed anyway. And algorithm inputs used raw pointers which required careful handling. Because of the use of raw pointers in many critical places, I would run builds with Address Sanitizer as part of CI pipeline and also occasionally locally, so I felt safe about the lack of out-of-bounds accesses. Debuggers wouldn’t be able to display the arrays without custom visualizers, and more crucially would have problems evaluating member access (this is true of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; as well depending on the debugger), which made watch expressions more complex and debugging - less pleasant. The status quo provided neither complete safety, nor complete performance, and I decided to try to use raw pointers instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one other benefit of containers is the extra protection against memory leaks - I wasn’t particularly keen on remembering to free each allocated pointer, so I made a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;meshopt_Allocator&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;/&gt; that could allocate large blocks of typed data and remember the allocated pointer; at the end of the scope all allocated blocks would be deleted. This resulted in the fused allocator+array class being split into two - a special allocator class fulfilled the memory management duties, and as for the array a raw pointer would suffice. Address Sanitizer, along with rigorous testing and hand crafted assertion statements, would keep the code correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;147 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;260 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;720 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;320 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;132 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;294 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;699 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;301 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;131 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;297 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;697 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;300 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;141 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;194 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1080 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;261 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m not 100% happy with the tradeoff, it has worked well so far. It’s great to remove the cognitive overhead associated with figuring out whether in each function we should use a raw pointer, an iterator or the container. Worth noting is that the overhead that builds with Address Sanitizer have is very reasonable, and having it on makes me feel safer since it captures a superset of the problems bounds checks in containers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/sanitizer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;147 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;721 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc asan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1229 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc asan ubsan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;260 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1532 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;135 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;695 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang asan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;154 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1266 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang asan ubsan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;180 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1992 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve switched to raw pointers, there’s really not much of C++ left in our code. There is still an occasional template or two, but the number of instantiations is small enough that we could duplicate the code for each type we need it for. meshoptimizer uses C++ casts for pointers and functional casts (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int(v)&lt;/code&gt;) for numbers, but C has neither, so that has to change. A few other syntactical annoyances emerge, but really it’s not hard at this point to make a C version of the code. It does require more sacrifices, and there’s the issue of MSVC that either has to use C89 or compile our C99 code as C++, unless we’re willing to only support latest MSVC versions, but it’s doable. After we have stopped using every C++ standard header though, does it really matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler/stl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release compile&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;debug run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;release run&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;209 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;710 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;321 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;95 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;254 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;711 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;310 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc c++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;139 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1087 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;262 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;msvc c99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;125 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;180 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1085 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;261 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a notable impact on gcc/clang compilation time - we save ~40 ms in both by switching to C. The real difference at this point is in the standard headers - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; that happens to be substantially larger in C++ mode compared to C mode, and that difference will increase even more once the default compilation mode is set to C++17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c99&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c++98&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c++11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c++14&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;c++17&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gcc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;143 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;147 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;147 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;214 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;95 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;129 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;133 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;134 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;215 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang libc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;95 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;130 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;132 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;136 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;140 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; includes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmath&lt;/code&gt; in gcc/clang which pulls in a lot of C++ machinery, and in C++17 in libstdc++ adds a slew of new special functions, that are rarely useful but will make compilation slower anyway. Removing the dependency on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; is easy in this case&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-c++ highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#ifdef __GNUC__
#define fabsf(x) __builtin_fabsf(x)
#define sqrtf(x) __builtin_sqrtf(x)
#else
#include &amp;lt;math.h&amp;gt;
#endif
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and brings us all the way to C compile times. This is definitely an area where libstdc++ and libc++ could improve in the future - I don’t think it’s reasonable to force users of C headers to pay for the C++ baggage. With the exception of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; issue, it doesn’t look like C is faster to compile than C++ assuming a compile time conscious subset of C++ is used - so at this point a switch to C isn’t warranted for meshoptimizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the excursion through past, present and possible future changes in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; was useful. When making C/C++ libraries, it’s important to pay attention to more than just correctness - portability, ease of compilation, compilation times, runtimes in both debug and release, debuggability - all of these are important and will help reduce the friction for both users of the library and contributors. C++ is an unforgiving language, but, given enough time and effort, it’s possible to get good performance - assuming you’re willing to question everything, including practices that are sometimes believed to be universal, such as the effectiveness or efficiency of STL or CRT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with half a second of compile times on gcc and 36 seconds of runtime on MSVC in debug mode and ended with 100 ms compile times for gcc and around a second of runtime on MSVC, which is much more pleasant to work with. Of course, at 1K lines compiling for 100 ms, and assuming linear scaling, we would require a full second per 10K lines, which is still substantially slower than some other languages - but not entirely unreasonable for a full build ran on a single core. Getting there for large codebases developed over many years is a much harder problem, one that will be left as an exercise for the reader ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All source modifications to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/zeux/bf847986e0474cf48f61bb5749da38e4&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;; in order described in the article, it’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifiervsm.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifiervs.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifierv.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifierb.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.cpp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;simplifier.c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twins get different results when they put 5 ancestry DNA kits to the test</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dna-ancestry-kits-twins-marketplace-1.4980976</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dna-ancestry-kits-twins-marketplace-1.4980976</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One set of identical twins, two different ancestry profiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least that's the suggestion from one of the world's largest ancestry DNA testing companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last spring,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt; host Charlsie Agro and her twin sister, Carly, bought home kits from AncestryDNA, MyHeritage, 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA and Living DNA, and mailed samples of their DNA to each company for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite having virtually identical DNA, the twins did not receive matching results from any of the companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In most cases, the results from the same company traced each sister's ancestry to the same parts of the world — albeit by varying percentages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the results from California-based 23andMe seemed to suggest each twin had unique twists in their ancestry composition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982701.1547759152!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/23andme.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to 23andMe's findings, Charlsie has nearly 10 per cent less &quot;broadly European&quot; ancestry than Carly. She also has French and German ancestry (2.6 per cent) that her sister doesn't share.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The identical twins also apparently have different degrees of Eastern European heritage — 28 per cent for Charlsie compared to 24.7 per cent for Carly. And while Carly's Eastern European ancestry was linked to Poland, the country was listed as &quot;not detected&quot; in Charlsie's results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The fact that they present different results for you and your sister, I find very mystifying,&quot; said Dr. Mark Gerstein, a computational biologist at Yale University&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twins' DNA 'shockingly similar'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marketplace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sent the results from all five companies to Gerstein's team for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He says any results the Agro twins received from the same DNA testing company should have been identical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And there's a simple reason for that: The raw data collected from both sisters' DNA is nearly exactly the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It's shockingly similar,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watch: Yale scientists mystified by different results for twin sisters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Yale scientists are &quot;mystified&quot; by different results for twin sisters. 1:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team at Yale was able to download and analyze the raw data set that each company used to perform its calculations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An entire DNA sample is made up of about three billion parts, but companies that provide ancestry tests look at about 700,000 of those to spot genetic differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the raw data from 23andMe, 99.6 per cent of those parts were the same, which is why Gerstein and his team were so confused by the results. They concluded the raw data used by the other four companies was also statistically identical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, none of the five companies provided the same ancestry breakdown for the twins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We think the numbers should be spot on the same,&quot; Gerstein said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While he can't say for certain what accounts for the difference, Gerstein suspects it has to do with the algorithms each company uses to crunch the DNA data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The story has to be the calculation. The way these calculations are run are different.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked why the twins didn't get the same results given the fact their DNA is so similar, 23andMe told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt; in an email that even those minor variations can lead its algorithm to assign slightly different ancestry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company said it approaches the development of its tools and reports with scientific rigour, but admits its results are &quot;statistical estimates.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Differences across all 5 companies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Family had told the Agro sisters their ancestors come from Sicily, Poland and Ukraine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the results each sister received from the ancestry companies revealed some surprising — and, in some cases, conflicting — family history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982692.1547758929!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/marketplacetrippic.JPG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Charlsie Agro and her aunt, Marjoh Agro, on vacation in Malta last summer. Before using DNA ancestry kits, the Agro sisters believed most of their ancestry traces back to Sicily, Poland and Ukraine. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AncestryDNA found the twins have predominantly Eastern European ancestry (38 per cent for Carly and 39 per cent for Charlsie).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the results from MyHeritage trace the majority of their ancestry to the Balkans (60.6 per cent for Carly and 60.7 per cent for Charlsie).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982848.1547762633!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ancestrydnafinal.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982856.1547762756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/myheritagefinal.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the more surprising findings was in Living DNA's results, which pointed to a small percentage of ancestry from England for Carly, but Scotland and Ireland for Charlsie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4982718.1547759497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/graphic4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another twist came courtesy of FamilyTreeDNA, which assigned 13-14 per cent of the twins' ancestry to the Middle East — significantly more than the other four companies, two of which found no trace at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Maier&lt;span&gt;, chief geneticist at FamilyTreeDNA, acknowledges that identifying genetic distinctions in people from different places is a challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Finding the boundaries is itself kind of a frontiering science, so I would say that makes it kind of a science and an art,&quot; Maier said in a phone interview.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How it works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to determine someone's ancestry, companies like 23andMe compare a DNA sample to what is commonly referred to as a reference panel. A reference panel is made up of a select number of DNA samples, from previous customers who have taken the test and/or from publicly available DNA databases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Simon Gravel, a population geneticist with McGill University who is also part of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalgenome.org/about/#1000G_PROJECT&quot;&gt;1000 Genomes Project&lt;/a&gt;, says ancestry companies will take 700,000 or so of your DNA segments and use an algorithm to compare your segments to those in their reference panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;They're going to match it to different parts of the world,&quot; he said. &quot;In the end, there's going to be some overall of these [reference panel] contributions where your DNA matched better, and that's going to be their estimate of how much ancestry you have.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text-items&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-quotation&quot;&gt;They kind of need to take a pencil more or less and say, 'That's a region.' And different companies draw different circles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-source&quot;&gt;- Dr. Simon Gravel, population geneticist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Different companies use different panels, so they're each likely to provide the same customer with different ancestry results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a statement to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt;, AncestryDNA acknowledged that the size of the reference panel is key. The company said it is &quot;always working to improve its science&quot; and that its &quot;new, larger reference panel will give customers more precise results.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why so different?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a variety of factors that can affect the accuracy of results from an ancestry company, Dr. Gravel says, but of particular importance is the size and quality of its reference panel. The larger and more representative it is, the more accurate the results, he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you have fewer people that you can compare to, then you make more shortcuts,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;You also run more of a risk of having missed diversity that you might not know existed in one particular region.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another reason for discrepancies in the results from different companies is the arbitrary way each company defines the world's regions, Gravel says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;They kind of need to take a pencil more or less and say, 'That's a region.' And different companies draw different circles.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch: Do consumers expect DNA ancestry results to be 100% accurate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Do consumers believe the hype around DNA ancestry tests? 1:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gravel also says the tests tend to be more accurate for people with European ancestry, as more people with that particular background have been tested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He cautions people not to interpret their test results as definitive. He says a testing company can use DNA ancestry kits to trace a person's ancestry to a particular continent with statistical accuracy, but anything more specific than that, like pinpointing a country or town, is less reliable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;similarLinkText&quot;&gt;For the good of the planet, can we curb our addiction to road salt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lack of oversight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The biggest DNA ancestry companies have tested millions of people. MyHeritage, for example, says it expects sales of well over $100 million this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the popularity of ancestry testing, there is absolutely no government or professional oversight of the industry to ensure the validity of the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's a situation Gravel finds troubling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Usually in science we have a process like peer review and make the data accessible, and make the algorithms accessible, that's how we ensure the high quality of the data,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;In this case, we don't have access to that because the companies keep the data private.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's why Gravel says consumers should take the results generated by these tests with a grain of salt. People need to understand these tests are not subject to the same standard as diagnostic medical testing. They are more like a &quot;recreational scientific activity,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to 23andMe, MyHeritage says its results are &quot;ethnicity estimates.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When spokesperson Rafi Mendelson was then asked why MyHeritage presents results with such certainty — video results sent to customers declare, &quot;You are,&quot; before listing a person's ancestry — he said he believes the messaging is clear, that results are only estimates, and that North American consumers are especially clear on this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results subject to change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever your ancestry results, don't get too attached to them. They could change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In September, AncestryDNA informed customers that it had updated their estimates with the following message:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Your DNA doesn't change, but we now have 13,000 additional reference samples and powerful, new science to give you better ethnicity results.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ancestry estimates used in this story are from Nov. 6, 2018, after the company updated the twins' results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new estimates included previously undetected ancestral ties to Russia, Greece, the Balkans and Baltics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
