Everyone on all Wikimedia wikis has been logged out, and will have to log
back in again.

This was done out of an abundance of caution, after we received one (1)
user report of being logged in as someone else.

Said report coincided with the deployment of a new MediaWiki release which
caused other problems around User session objects; this is possibly related
and under active investigation.

We believe the number of possibly-affected users was small, and that the
time window in which the error was possible was short.  However, we believe
that resetting all sessions is a prudent measure to ensure that the impact
is limited.

More details to follow, after technical investigation has determined a
cause.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T264370&quot;&gt;https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T264370&lt;/a&gt;

Apologies for the disruption,

<title>Pressing YubiKeys</title>
<link>https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you work in tech, you probably have a YubiKey. I have this one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nano/&quot;&gt;YubiKey 5C Nano&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YubiKey 5C Nano&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t work in tech but primarily work on your laptop, you probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have a YubiKey. And if you work on a political campaign or as a journalist, you should definitely have one (or something similar). Talk to your IT Security department about that. This post will mostly be about something your IT Security department doesn’t want to hear about, though, so maybe don’t mention it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YubiKeys act as two-factor authentication. This means that after you log-in to a system with your username and password, the system requires you to authorize in a second way as well. This way if your login credentials are compromised, the attacker would also have to compromise the second form of authentication, which is harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different forms of two-factor authentication - a common one is that a website will ask you to scan a QR code with the Google Authenticator app (or similar) on your phone which will generate 6 digit codes. The way this works is that the server and the app both have a shared secret. The phone generates codes based on that secret and the current timestamp and the server generates the same codes and sees if they match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/qr-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;QR Code&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/authenticator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Authenticator&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one is SMS-based 2FA, which is pretty widely regarded as insecure. In this case, the server generates a code and sends it to your phone via SMS. The reason it’s considered insecure is that an attack exists called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam&quot;&gt;SIM-jacking&lt;/a&gt; where someone convinces a cell phone carrier to port a number to a new SIM card, effectively directing all SMS traffic to their phone instead of yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/wells.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wells Fargo&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YubiKeys are small devices that plug in to the USB port of your computer and emulate a keyboard. When tapped, they emit a one-time password (OTP) which can be then verified by a validation server. A private key exists on the device which is used to sign information, but it can never leave the device because it is stored in a tamper-resistant environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YubiKey that I use is designed to always sit in a USB port of my laptop, so whenever I would take my laptop from my desk to a conference room or to another office, it was always available. But like many new remote workers, my laptop never leaves my desk anymore. I have it hooked up to an external monitor and to save some desk space, I have it in clamshell mode sitting vertically on a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes tapping the YubiKey difficult, especially when I store my laptop far away from my keyboard and mouse. I solved this by buying a &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DMMW4J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;USB-C extension cable&lt;/a&gt;, which brought the YubiKey closer to my keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven’t mentioned about the YubiKey 5C Nano is that it’s kind of difficult to tap, even without the distance issues. The target area that you need to touch is extremely small:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano-big.png&quot; alt=&quot;YubiKey 5C Nano&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features of the YubiKey is that the little metal strip determines that it is being tapped by a human - this prevents it from being accidentally triggered by bumping your laptop into something, but if you’ve ever seen a one-time password in a Slack channel or Google Doc like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tlerefhcvijlngibueiiuhkeibbcbecehvjiklltnbbl&lt;/code&gt;, you know it isn’t a perfect system. I would estimate that 1 in 5 times that I attempt to trigger it, it doesn’t register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of thought has gone into ensuring that the YubiKey can’t be triggered from software on the computer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, I’d like to acknowledge the reasons for this. If a remote attacker were to compromise your laptop, being able to trigger the YubiKey from software on the computer defeats the whole point of using the YubiKey. But I think we always make tradeoffs between security and convenience - for example, you often don’t have to enter your YubiKey every time you access a system, some systems will only ask you once and not ask you again on subsequent logins for a certain amount of time. When you use a 2FA system and it gives you “backup codes”, do you always print those out and store them in a safe location? Everyone should figure out what level of security and convenience they are okay with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, let’s talk about how you could trigger a YubiKey with software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been calling this mechanism &lt;strong&gt;The Finger&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need some way for the computer to talk to &lt;strong&gt;The Finger&lt;/strong&gt;. I had a bunch of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076F53B6S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;IZOKEE D1 Mini&lt;/a&gt; development boards lying around, they are smaller versions of boards that use the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266&quot;&gt;ESP8266&lt;/a&gt; chip found in a lot of IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/d1-mini.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IZOKEE D1 Mini&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can connect this to the laptop and talk to it over USB serial, but since it has WiFi, we can also just run a webserver on it and send it HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need some way to push &lt;strong&gt;The Finger&lt;/strong&gt; towards the Yubikey. After a little googling, I found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CP18J4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;28BYJ-48 stepper motor&lt;/a&gt; interfaces well with the D1 Mini board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;stepper motor&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepper motors convert electrical pulses into mechanical rotation and the D1 Mini has pins for sending electrical pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;stepper motor&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But stepper motors rotate and we mostly just need to poke in a straight direction. So I searched on Thingiverse for “28BYJ-48” and found this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3593641&quot;&gt;28BYJ-48 Motor Halter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor-case.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28BYJ-48 Motor Halter&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attaches a gear to the motor which can guide a long rack forward and backward. But if we’re going to push a long plastic thing toward the YubiKey, it might as well look like a finger. Back to Thingiverse, this time searching for “finger” and I found this model someone made for Halloween:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;finger&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened up these two models in Fusion 360 and used an advanced CAD technique called “smooshing”, resulting in this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_smoosh.png&quot; alt=&quot;finger&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I exported the smooshed STL and 3D printed it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/715-prusament-pla-lipstick-red-1kg.html&quot;&gt;Prusament PLA Lipstick Red&lt;/a&gt; because that’s what I happened to have in my printer at the time. Then I took the plastic finger and touched the YubiKey which.. didn’t do anything. I picked up a metal screw on my desk and touched the YubiKey, which immediately spit out a OTP. So then I took the finger and secured it to my desk with a vise and drilled a small hole in it, then screwed the metal screw into it and touched it to the YubiKey, which again did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/vise.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;vise&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I realized that I’m an idiot and that when I had touched the metal screw to the Yubikey, it was just transmitting the electrical charge from my body to the metal screw, which then transmitted it to the capacitive touch sensor on the YubiKey. So how could I trick the capacitive touch sensor into thinking it was a real finger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guessed that the way that capacitive touch sensors work is that they’re measuring your body’s capacitance to ground, so if we just hook up the sensor directly towards ground, it’ll think that its really conductive or at least conductive enough for a human finger to be between the two. So I took an insulated wire, unscrewed the metal screw slightly, wrapped it around the screw and tightened it again. Then I took the other end and connected it the GND port on the D1 Mini board, touched it to the YubiKey, and it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the driver board for the stepper motor already connects to the 5V and GND on the D1 Mini, so I thought I might have to strip the GND wire and run it to both the driver board and the screw, but on a whim I decided to just wedge the end of the wire from the metal screw between the stepper motor metal body (figuring the metal body case was grounded) and the plastic housing. This also worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/ground.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;grounding&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I confirmed that the finger would trigger the YubiKey, I needed a way to mount the YubiKey close to the finger, so I used my digital calipers to measure the size of the USB-C extension cable and designed a holder in Fusion 360.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/holder.png&quot; alt=&quot;holder&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB-C extension cable would go into the hole on the left and the motor would mount on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have to wire the stepper motor driver board to the D1 Mini. This can be done by soldering some headers onto the D1 Mini and then connecting some Dupont jumper wires between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/pins.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pins&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;D1 Mini&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;28BYJ-48 Driver Board&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5V&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5V&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GND&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GND&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;D1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IN1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;D2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IN2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;D3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IN3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;D4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IN4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we put the stepper motor into the housing and screw everything together, it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/setup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;setup&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is much more straightforward. The D1 Mini can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. First, we go into Preferences and add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;em&gt;Additional Board Manager URLs&lt;/em&gt;. Then when you go into the &lt;em&gt;Boards Managers&lt;/em&gt;, you can install the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;esp8266&lt;/code&gt; package which includes the board &lt;strong&gt;LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 &amp;amp; mini&lt;/strong&gt;, which should be selected under &lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I’ll run a sketch for blinking the LED just to verify that it’s working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#define LED 2 //Define blinking LED pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level)
  delay(1000); // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(1000); // Wait for two seconds
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_ESP8266_28BYJ-48_Stepper_ESP8STP-1&quot;&gt;sketch&lt;/a&gt; that shows how to control the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor using WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the parts that have to do with the motor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int Pin1 = D1; //IN1 is connected 
int Pin2 = D2; //IN2 is connected   
int Pin3 = D3; //IN3 is connected 
int Pin4 = D4; //IN4 is connected 
 
int pole1[] ={0,0,0,0, 0,1,1,1, 0}; //pole1, 8 step values
int pole2[] ={0,0,0,1, 1,1,0,0, 0}; //pole2, 8 step values
int pole3[] ={0,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0, 0}; //pole3, 8 step values
int pole4[] ={1,1,0,0, 0,0,0,1, 0}; //pole4, 8 step values

int poleStep = 0; 
int dirStatus = 3; // stores direction status 3= stop (do not change)
String argId[] ={&quot;ccw&quot;, &quot;cw&quot;};

...

void loop(void) {
    server.handleClient();
    MDNS.update();

    if (dirStatus == 1) {
        poleStep++;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else if (dirStatus == 2) {
        poleStep--;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else {
        driveStepper(8);
    }
    
    if (poleStep&amp;gt;7) { 
        poleStep=0; 
    }

    if (poleStep&amp;lt;0) {
        poleStep=7; 
    }

    delay(1);
}

/*
 * motorControl()
 * updates the value of &quot;dirStatus&quot; varible to 1, 2 or 3
 * returns nothing
 */
void motorControl() {
    if (server.arg(argId[0]) == &quot;on&quot;) {
        dirStatus = 1;  // CCW 
    } else if (server.arg(argId[0]) == &quot;off&quot;) {
        dirStatus = 3;  // motor OFF 
    } else if (server.arg(argId[1]) == &quot;on&quot;) {
        dirStatus = 2;  // CW  
    } else if (server.arg(argId[1]) == &quot;off&quot;) {
        dirStatus = 3;  // motor OFF
    }
}

/*
 * @brief sends signal to the motor
 * @param &quot;c&quot; is integer representing the pol of motor
 * @return does not return anything
 */
void driveStepper(int c)
{
    digitalWrite(Pin1, pole1[c]);  
    digitalWrite(Pin2, pole2[c]); 
    digitalWrite(Pin3, pole3[c]); 
    digitalWrite(Pin4, pole4[c]);   
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works is that the web server displays two buttons: CCW (Counter clock-wise) and CW (Clock-wise). If either of these two buttons is toggled, it changes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dirStatus&lt;/code&gt; to 1 (for CCW) and 2 (for CW). If the button is toggled off, it changes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dirStatus&lt;/code&gt; to 3 to stop the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop()&lt;/code&gt; function that it is checking this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dirStatus&lt;/code&gt; to either increment the poleStep (until it loops around), decrement it (until it loops around), or stop it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we would like instead is a single HTTP endpoint that will move the motor counter-clockwise until it hits the Yubikey and then clockwise to retract, and then stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can rewrite the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;motorControl()&lt;/code&gt; function to simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;void motorControl() {
  dirStatus = 1;    // CCW 
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which will start moving the motor counter-clockwise when the HTTP endpoint is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we modify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop()&lt;/code&gt; function to move for 400 steps, change the direction to CW and move 400 steps in that direction, and then stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int steps = 0;

void loop(void) {
    server.handleClient();
    MDNS.update();

    if (dirStatus == 1) {
        poleStep++;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
        steps++;
    } else if (dirStatus == 2) {
        poleStep--;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
        steps++;
    } else {
        driveStepper(8);
    }
    
    if (poleStep&amp;gt;7) { 
        poleStep=0; 
    }

    if (poleStep&amp;lt;0) {
        poleStep=7; 
    }

    if (steps &amp;gt; 400) {
        if (dirStatus == 1) {
            dirStatus = 2;  // CW
        } else {
            dirStatus = 3;  // motor OFF     
        }
        steps = 0;
    }

    delay(1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about the physical design of &lt;strong&gt;The Finger&lt;/strong&gt; is that it’s very forgiving: the motor isn’t very strong so once it hits the YubiKey, it can continue pushing counter-clockwise without damaging anything. And when it goes clockwise, eventually the bone sticking out of the finger knocks against the edge of the base, preventing it from falling off to the right. I started with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/code&gt; maxing out at 1000 and manually tested it, lowering it a bit each time until I found the sweet spot of 400 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I checked the MAC address of the WiFi board, made a static IP mapping on my router for it, and made a local DNS entry of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finger.localdomain&lt;/code&gt; to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I make a call to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://finger.localdomain/press&lt;/code&gt;, the motor will push the finger towards the YubiKey and retract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;triggering-the-finger&quot;&gt;Triggering The Finger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pressing a YubiKey with your finger isn’t very satisfying, pressing a key on a mechanical keyboard is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It would be cool if we could trigger the YubiKey just by hitting a key on our keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a TKL layout, in the top right of your keyboard, you have Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause, all of which don’t make a whole lot of sense in 2020 and are ripe for remapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/&quot;&gt;Karabiner-Elements&lt;/a&gt; to help with this remapping. Much like the hardware portion of this project, it is also a bit Rube Goldberg-esque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the UI, under the &lt;em&gt;Simple modifications&lt;/em&gt; tab, you can change “From key” to “pause” and “To key” to “f14”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then switch to the &lt;em&gt;Misc&lt;/em&gt; tab and click “Open config folder (~/.config/karabiner)”. Here you’ll find a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;karabiner.json&lt;/code&gt;. Under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;profiles.rules&lt;/code&gt; key, you can add this JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;          {
            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;F14 to trigger Yubikey&quot;,
            &quot;manipulators&quot;: [
              {
                &quot;from&quot;: {
                  &quot;key_code&quot;: &quot;f14&quot;,
                  &quot;modifiers&quot;: {
                    &quot;optional&quot;: [&quot;any&quot;]
                  }
                },
                &quot;to&quot;: [
                  {
                    &quot;shell_command&quot;: &quot;osascript /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/bin/yubikey.scpt&quot;
                  }
                ],
                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;basic&quot;
              }
            ]
          },
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/bin/yubikey.scpt&lt;/code&gt; you can write an Applescript to call a shell script like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;do shell script &quot;/bin/sh ~/bin/yubikey.sh 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have an Applescript call a shell script? I found that when I launched the shell script directly from Karabiner Elements, it opened a new instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Terminal.app&lt;/code&gt; and took focus away from the window that is prompting for the YubiKey. This causes everything to run in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/bin/yubikey.sh&lt;/code&gt;, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
curl &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;http://finger.localdomain/press&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--silent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /dev/null
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a fake YubiKey prompt to demo this, but I assure you that it works on real YubiKey prompts as well. Here’s the code for the fake YubiKey prompt in case for some reason you need to make fake YubiKey prompts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;YubiKey for 'bert': &quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;read &lt;/span&gt;yubikey
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;tput setaf 2&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;tput sgr0&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that shell script, we can call it from other places as well. iTerm2 has a feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-triggers.html&quot;&gt;Triggers&lt;/a&gt;, which can execute actions based on text matching a regex in your terminal. So we could write a regex to listen for “Yubikey for” and have it run the same script, eliminating the need to press buttons altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to make a custom Chrome extension that waits for certain URLs that request YubiKeys and makes a browser fetch to our HTTP endpoint in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed this to someone and they said, “So.. you built a button that you press that will press a button? Why not just press the button?” which was a bit infuriating because they clearly missed the whole point. “Don’t you get it? This button BAD, but this button GOOD. Me want to press GOOD button.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the things that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Privacy is the most important concept of our time</title>
<link>https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have always believed in the importance of privacy, but I felt that common definitions (e.g., &lt;em&gt;the right to be left alone&lt;/em&gt;) were lacking. In fact, I think that the whole conceptualization of privacy as simply a right of an individual as partial and limiting. It could be because privacy, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy&quot;&gt;it is intended nowadays, originated from the Anglo-American world (that is what Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that then, maybe, I am not really thinking about privacy, but rather something else. That might be true, so let’s not talk about privacy, instead let’s talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco&quot;&gt;Ur-Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, the properties of any version of the concept of privacy you might have. Take this as the opinion of a random guy that cares about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-2bb1c84e&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;uagb-heading-text&quot;&gt;What is Ur-Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;uagb-desc-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few principles for privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy is about boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It is not about hiding something from someone but allowing to create a space with rules&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;decided by its members&lt;/strong&gt;. I like to compare it to borders. Some people say that borders are a restriction, something that limit freedom of movement and we do not need in the contemporary world. As if they were arbitrary obstacles put there by the ancient petty Greek gods. It almost makes sense if you do not think about them, after all you are actually stopped at a border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is not true, that is not why they exist. Borders delimit the area that a certain state control, an area where a specific set of rules and laws applies. There was a time before borders, in fact most of human history did not have clear borders. It was not a time of freedom, but anarchy, where bands of barbarians could roam into your home and pillage everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context is also important to remember that before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia&quot;&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; modern European states were plagued by continual wars. The short version is that this was due to the combination of two facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;modernity begets differences, different kings choose different religions&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;link_1&quot; href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#note_1&quot; data-type=&quot;internal&quot; data-id=&quot;#note_1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and separated societies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;however, the legitimacy of kings was still based on shared medieval ideals, like the concept of divine rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the issue was not that leaders wanted to make war all the time, they needed to do so because the legitimacy of their power depended, at least on some level, to what the rest of the European world was doing. If you claim to be a divine king there better be agreement on what the divine is, otherwise a guy that picks a different religion can also rightly pick a different king. To change the situation this peace treaty established the principle that the internal affairs of a state are the exclusive interest of said state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection with privacy is that without clear rules on what is private and what is public, nobody knows which stuff belongs to whom and this means that all belong to the strongest. &lt;strong&gt;Somebody might say that what you do in private, it is not private at all but political, it concerns the society at large. Therefore it must be regulated according to their rules&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy is about control&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Without privacy we cannot decide for ourselves how to live our lives.&lt;/strong&gt; If there is no privacy all become public. Whoever has more power and an interest can affect your life according to their own rules. Then, I have to care about what other people think, otherwise they will control how I can behave. As before the peace of Westphalia, the issue is not that other people are bad, &lt;em&gt;they have to do it&lt;/em&gt;. When everything is subject to public scrutiny, you either control the rules and judge others or you are judged and controlled by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about this way: we say a lot of things in our private lives that are not meant to be taken literally. In private we say something and then we add: &lt;em&gt;you know what I mean&lt;/em&gt;. And that is actually true. We can do that because the people we talk to in private know us; they understand the context in which our words must be understood. When I was a child I would sometimes say and think that I wanted to kill my brother. I did not meant literally and everybody knew it. If I said the same thing now, in public, to somebody that does not know me, the phrase would be different. It would be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat&quot;&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that? They are the exact same words. You know why, of course. I am different and the context is different. The real meaning of something, whether an action or a word, is not absolute, in most cases is relative. When we speak in public, we share a different context, therefore our words have a different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even I say something as an hyperbole or as an potentially implicit threat (e.g., &lt;em&gt;they must be stopped at all costs&lt;/em&gt;!), they might protest. You might say that they are overreacting, that it was just a joke, but &lt;em&gt;how can they be sure of it&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;strong&gt;They do not know me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And it is true that acts of violence are prepared by violent words&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you are unsure if something is really violent, you have to take a stand. You have to make clear that any attack against you is not permissible. Otherwise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings&quot;&gt;somebody, maybe a crazy guy, might think that it is permissible and the right course of action&lt;/a&gt;. Somebody might feel legitimate to take your land and kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear example of the loss of privacy is the &lt;em&gt;rise of violent rhetoric&lt;/em&gt;. Everybody swears and everybody threaten. However, for the most part they do not mean it. We know that because the actual rate of violence has not risen. We simply talk in public as we talk in private, because our private lives have become more public. I mean, some bosses want even to look at your Facebook profile&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#note_2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;link_2&quot; href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/note_2&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-7db02091&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;uagb-heading-text&quot;&gt;Privacy Affects Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;uagb-desc-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defending privacy would require all-around changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy is the most important concept of our time, because it allows to define everything else. Without privacy we do not know what rules applies. Our lives will be judged according to the rules, even the whims, of somebody else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People lost jobs and had their lives ruined, because the mob judged something they said in private in a different way from what they expected. And they paid a price. You might say: that was fair. We might judge ourselves by our intentions, but others by their actions, which are real and objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; – Free Speech&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for once, disagree with XKCD and this view. There are a couple of different issues here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how we should react to speech we disagree with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what was meant to be shared among friends was taken out of context and made public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complicates the whole matter. At a first glance the first issue should not matter here, because we are talking about privacy. However, this is a bit more complicated. Violations of privacy can affect other rights and freedom. Freedom of speech is a right regarding the public sphere. You have always been able to say everything in private, for the simple fact that people cannot control that. If now the private becomes public, then either we get absolute freedom of speech (a sort of &lt;em&gt;speech anarchy&lt;/em&gt;, if you will) or we lose freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, then we demand to not violate privacy even in the case of bad speech. If you said something bad in private then I cannot demand your boss to fire you. I cannot do that even by maintaining privacy: &lt;em&gt;trust me on this, they say something really bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you should fire them&lt;/em&gt;. This is a practical example of how privacy might affect everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is crucial, but we have to understand that simply enforcing privacy in the traditional way is not enough anymore. To protect privacy we need to re-interpret some rights we have. For instance, traditionally there have been exceptions to privacy for public interest. If you heard somebody famous saying something controversial in private you could go public about. The issue is that few people (i.e., the press) had that power. Now we all have it. &lt;strong&gt;So, to defend privacy we need to accept shared norms of behavior&lt;/strong&gt;. We cannot expect consequences outside the context that caused them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hard to do, because people have different idea of public interest. It is not true that we judge other by their actions. We judge others by &lt;em&gt;our intentions&lt;/em&gt;. So, we must be strict about the norm that the answer to some speech should be only some other form speech. In other words, if somebody offended you with some method, you should respond with the same method. If somebody said something bad, you cannot shove them. &lt;strong&gt;Actions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, punish a convicted transgressor, or intimidate them is not an answer to a bad argument, it is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&quot;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between killing somebody and just ruining their lives. However, it is still bad. It is still lynching, something we do to one to control one hundred. Making somebody lose their livelihood because of something said in private it is not fair, because they said in a different context. They were not prepared to be judged by their worst enemies. And they should not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosopher Jeremy Bentham described the perfect prison as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon&quot;&gt;Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;. A prison where in every cell there was a one-way mirror. This way the guards could watch the inmates without being seen. Therefore the inmates would have to behave as if they were always watched. That kind of sounds like the world right now. And I am ready to lose the power to punish bad people in order to protect me from people that think I am a bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the discussion on Hacker News, I think that I was a bit unclear here. The connection between privacy and freedom of speech is just an example. My point is that privacy affects how we enjoy other rights, too. Even though that might not seem obvious at first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-64381e5f&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;uagb-heading-text&quot;&gt;What Should We Do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;uagb-desc-text&quot;&gt;A modest proposal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what has to be done to defend privacy? &lt;strong&gt;There should be clear boundaries about private, social and public spaces&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a private space regards only you or your family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a social space is something involving a community, either a virtual one like a forum or a real one like a city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a public space is a space for all actors of society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By clear boundaries I mean that we should create rules, norms and even icons to define these spaces. For instance, we should demand that if you are about to post something that is going to be seen by the whole world, then a social network should show you a globe in the input box, maybe even color-code it in &lt;span&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, we should make laws to defend the differences between such spaces. For example, no ad-tracking in private spaces. No sharing of private content with third-parties&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;link_3&quot; href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#note_3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Even legal authorities should not be able to just ask for &lt;em&gt;anything private of John Smith, please&lt;/em&gt;. The authorities should be able only to get access to something that is directly linked to the matter at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that was shared in a social space, should not be taken out of it. Sharing of such content should be blocked and moral norms should require that we chastise people that try to publicize that. Yes, even if you find something compromising about your enemy, you should say no to bring it in the the public space. It belongs to somebody else. Authorities might have access to all such content, with a valid reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just examples. The gist of it is that we should go in such details, because ideals of freedom, justice and privacy are made real by statutes, laws and social norms. &lt;strong&gt;Ideals must have bodies to affect the real world&lt;/strong&gt;: we should find a way not just to talk about privacy, but to embody it in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know today as &lt;strong&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;freedom of assembly&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. were actually defined piece by piece. We should do the same for privacy, for the world that exists right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you might think that I was unfair to XKCD before. Companies have the right to block people on their platform so that they can sell ads to other companies without embarrassment. If people do not like that, they should make their own Facebook. The problem is that they cannot do that. You can make another newspaper, and to defend freedom of the press, the government cannot stop you. However, you cannot make another Facebook. You cannot find other 2 billions people to put in your social network. Competition is impossible. Therefore either the government regulates Facebook to allow all content or they force Facebook identities to behave like telephone numbers: if you go somewhere else you can bring them with you and operate with Facebook ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending privacy is going to be a long struggle: we will need to change many aspects of our societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;note_1&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#link_1&quot;&gt;↵&lt;/a&gt; The king decided the religion for the state, not the people: the principle was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cuius regio, eius religio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of personal &lt;em&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/em&gt; came later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;note_2&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#link_2&quot;&gt;↵&lt;/a&gt; Just say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;note_3&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inre.me/why-privacy-is-the-most-important-concept-of-our-time/#link_3&quot;&gt;↵&lt;/a&gt; Companies could still share content for technical reasons, such as hosting it. They would lose the cede the rights to third parties and to share it willy-nilly for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Flatpak: A security nightmare – two years later</title>
<link>https://www.flatkill.org/2020/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.flatkill.org/2020/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;theme-color&quot; content=&quot;#ffffff&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Flatpak - a security nightmare&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Flatpak - a security nightmare&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;../main.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;99.919329254475&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://flatkill.org/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about then heavily-pushed Flatpak, self-proclaimed &quot;Future of Apps on Linux&quot;. The article criticized the following three major flows in Flatpak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the apps have full access to the host system but users are misled to believe the apps are sandboxed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flatpak runtimes and apps do not get security updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flatpak breaks many aspects of desktop integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The sandbox is STILL a lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;filesystem=host&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;filesystem=home&lt;/span&gt; permissions, in other words, &lt;strong&gt;write access to the user home directory&lt;/strong&gt; (and more) so all it takes to escape the sandbox is trivial &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;echo download_and_execute_evil &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular applications on Flathub still suffer from this - Gimp, VSCodium, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Audacity, VLC are still not sandboxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, indeed, users are still mislead by the reassuring blue &quot;sandboxed&quot; icon. Two years is not enough to add a warning that an application is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; sandboxed if it comes with dangerous permissions (like full access to your home directory)? Seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.flatkill.org/2020/sandboxlie.png&quot; alt=&quot;sandboxlie&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flatpak apps and runtimes STILL contain long known security holes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about 20 minutes to find the first vulnerability in a Flathub application with full host access and I didn't even bother to use a vulnerability scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17498&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-17498&lt;/a&gt; with public exploit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; for some 8 months. The first app on Flathub I find to use libssh2 library is Gitg and, indeed, it does ship with unpatched libssh2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it just this one application? Let's look at the &lt;strong&gt;official runtimes&lt;/strong&gt; at the heart of Flatpak (org.freedesktop.Platform and org.gnome.Platform &lt;strong&gt;3.36&lt;/strong&gt; - as of time of writing used by most of the applications on Flathub). The first unpatched vulnerable dependency I found in the offical runtime is ffmpeg in version 4.2.1 with no security patches backported, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-12284&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-12284&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled upon an article from 2011 which started what is today known as flatpak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2&quot;&gt;in the words of the project founder:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2&quot; class=&quot;citation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Another problem is with security (or bugfix) updates in bundled libraries. With bundled libraries its much harder to upgrade a single library, as you need to find and upgrade each app that uses it. Better tooling and upgrader support can lessen the impact of this, but not completely eliminate it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading that it comes as no surprise flatpak still suffers from the same security issues as 2 years ago because flatpak developers knew about these problems from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local root exploits are NOT considered a minor issue anymore!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Two years ago I wrote about a trivial local root exploit using flatpak to install suid binaries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9780/&quot;&gt;CVE-2017-9780&lt;/a&gt;) and how it was downplayed by Flatpak developers as a minor security issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/0.8.7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am happy to see at least the attitude to local root exploits has changed and today &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/security/advisories/GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj&quot;&gt;local root exploits&lt;/a&gt; are considered high severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desktop integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System and user fonts are now available to flatpak applications and basic font rendering settings are respected as well, however do not expect your changes in /etc/fonts, typically setting a proper fallback font for CJK characters, to work with flatpak. KDE applications in flatpak are still ignoring themes, fonts and icon settings (tested with Qt5ct). Applications installed from the distribution sources do not have these problems, of course. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatkill.org/2020/desktopbrokenation.mp4&quot;&gt;A quick screen capture to demonstrate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, fcitx, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; IME for Chinese is still broken - it has been 2 years. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; I linked 2 years ago - especially of interest is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031#issuecomment-655134889&quot;&gt;the following comment&lt;/a&gt; directly from fcitx developer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Because fcitx im module in flatpak is from 4.2.97 and using a different dbus object path. &lt;strong&gt;It need to be the same version of fcitx on your host&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need to run multiple fcitx daemons on my desktop and switch between them as I switch flatpak apps depending on which fcitx libraries are bundled with that app or maybe in the future of linux apps it's not possible to type chinese anymore and it's fine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &quot;bundle everything&quot; approach has proven very useful on servers it clearly does not work for desktop applications, let's keep linking system libraries in desktop applications (and use the bundled libraries as a fallback only) to avoid introducing all these problems to Linux desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>“Really successful people say no to almost everything”</title>
<link>https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-says-this-is-1-simple-habit-that-separates-successful-people-from-everyone-else.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-says-this-is-1-simple-habit-that-separates-successful-people-from-everyone-else.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;94.485645933014&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;27.929292929293&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffet-says-you-should-hire-people-based-on-these-3-traits-but-only-1-truly-matters.html&quot;&gt;Billionaire Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is 87 years old and still capturing the world's attention as the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/jeff-bezos-is-worlds-only-100-billionaire-will-he-finally-start-giving-his-money-away.html&quot;&gt;richest person&lt;/a&gt; on the planet (as of this writing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how has he done it? Actually, it's not so much about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/lisa-calhoun/warren-buffett-just-won-a-bet-with-wall-street-with-big-takeaways-for-everyday-investors.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;what he has done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as it is &lt;em&gt;what he hasn't done&lt;/em&gt;. With all the demands on him every day, Buffett learned a long time ago that the greatest commodity of all is time. He simply mastered the art and practice of setting boundaries for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why this Buffett quote remains a powerful life lesson. The mega-mogul said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The powerful meaning behind Buffett's statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he meant saying no in the investment sense is not so important; what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important is that his advice, in whatever context, can apply to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; arriving at the crossroads of daily decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;41.018181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most ambitious people, we want to accomplish things. We are driven for results, doing more, learning things, getting promoted, and starting new ventures. But we also have our personal lives we can't ignore for optimum balance and &lt;a href=&quot;http://inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-be-much-happier-starting-tomorrow-practice-this-1-habit-rarely-found-at-work.html&quot;&gt;happiness&lt;/a&gt;. Ambition in this sense can mean taking care of family priorities, expanding our social circles, and pursuing hobbies and other interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when Buffett's advice is a bull's-eye to our conscience. We have to know what to shoot for to simplify our lives. It means saying no over and over again to the unimportant things flying in our direction every day and remaining focused on saying yes to the few things that truly matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steve Jobs agreed. It's about focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;30.044776119403&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs prophetically supported this notion of saying no at an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 1997. Here's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/04/tech/innovation/steve-jobs-quotes/index.html&quot;&gt;what he said&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Jobs and Buffett, it's hushing that loud voice in your head when it tempts you with yet another sexy proposition that might steer you off course. You say a resounding &lt;em&gt;NO!&lt;/em&gt; when it asks, &quot;Should I take this opportunity? It may never come around again.&quot; Sometimes, the best course of action is not taking any action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seven things successful people say no to every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Collins, famous author of the mega-bestseller &lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt;, once suggested that instead of to-do lists, we should make &quot;stop-doing&quot; lists. Because in obsessing over to-do lists full of things that don't really matter, we spend less time saying yes to the things that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven things the most successful people say no to on a regular basis. Perhaps you should too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. They say no to opportunities and things that don't excite them, speak to their values, or further their mission in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;30.047368421053&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. They say no to superficial &lt;a href=&quot;http://inc.com/marcel-schwantes/3-winning-habits-youll-find-in-most-successful-people-this-year.html&quot;&gt;networking events&lt;/a&gt; in which people swap business cards and never hear from one another. Why? Because successful people don't network. They build relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. They say no to spending time with uninspiring, critical, or negative people who drag them down. Time is precious -- choose a small circle of people who will energize you and challenge you to be better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. They say no to overworking. While it's true some successful people and many entrepreneurs put in 60 to 80 hours per week, very successful people aren't workaholics who neglect self-care and family. They recognize that if they can't take care of themselves, everything else suffers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. They say no to doing all the work. This comes down to one word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D-E-L-E-G-A-T-I-O-N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. They say no to giving the steering wheel of life to anyone else. Another Buffett quote affirms this: &quot;You've gotta keep control of your time and you can't unless you say no. You can't let people set your agenda in life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. They say no to people-pleasing. Successful people don't neglect their deepest wishes and desires to accommodate and yield to others' wishes and desires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buffett's three-step rule of focus for success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set you on the right course, take a coaching lesson from Buffett himself. He once &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus&quot;&gt;walked his personal pilot through a life-changing exercise in goal-setting&lt;/a&gt; that's since become popular in productivity and career circles. It's a simple, three-step process to set boundaries, say no to distractions, and home in on success. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Write down a list of your top 25 career goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Circle the five most important goals that truly speak to you. These are your most urgent goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's the real kicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Completely eliminate the other 20 goals you have listed. Just cross them off, despite if they hold weight or some level of importance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett says those 20 goals are lower and not urgent priorities, therefore, any effort invested in them steals away dedicated focus and energy from your five highest-priority goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;standardText lastItem&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is to say no to everything on that list except for what you have declared, in your heart-of-hearts, to be the five most important things. These are what you should put all your effort and focus into achieving. The rest are merely distractions that will get in the way of your reaching your ultimate success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months, many Britons have imported American discourse on race wholesale. When asked to analyze the experiences of black people in the United Kingdom, we now talk with an American accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look, for instance, at a meme that has been circulating among some of my white friends on Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have privilege as a White person because I can do all of these things without thinking twice about it … I can go jogging (#AmaudArbery). I can relax in the comfort of my own home (#BothemSean and #AtatianaJefferson). I can ask for help after being in a car crash (#Jonathan Ferrell and #RenishaMcBride). I can have a cellphone (#StephonClark). I can leave a party to get to safety (#JordanEdwards). I can play loud music (#JordanDavis). I can sell CDs (#AltonSterling). I can sleep (#AiyanaJones). I can walk from the corner store (#MikeBrown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post goes on and on, like an interminable spoken-word poem. All the individuals listed are American, but most of the people who have shared this on my timeline are British. In trying to express their solidarity with black Britons, they are affirming a supposedly transcendental truth: to be black is to live in perpetual terror of being murdered by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Britain is not America. And importing American race discourse into the United Kingdom not only prevents us from recognizing the specific ways in which racial injustice manifests in this country—it cloaks the reality of black British lives behind an abstraction that flattens our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain has a long and painful history of anti-black racism. In the twentieth century alone, the growing black presence led to a long catalogue of abuses: the 1919 race riots in Liverpool, Cardiff and London; the 1958 race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill; the 1969 police murder of David Oluwale, a Nigerian immigrant who was tortured, pissed on and finally drowned in a river in Leeds. I could list other examples. It is not hard to see why the horrific killing of George Floyd has evoked such strong feelings in this country as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all of the country’s flaws, Britain is not America. Trying to understand its racial dynamics through the lens of another country’s does more to obscure than to illuminate the situation that black Britons like myself actually face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average black American in the United States can trace his ancestry further back than the average white American. Most black Americans are descended from enslaved Africans. Their forebears suffered through the segregation and racial terror of the Jim Crow era. The majority of black people in the United Kingdom, by contrast, are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Though many of them have certainly had harrowing experiences with injustice or discrimination, they do not have the same history of racist disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the experience of black Britons, it is not only necessary to grasp how different their history is from that of black Americans: we need to understand the diversity captured by the label “black British.” For example, around two out of every three students with Congolese or Somali origins get free school meals, a standard indicator that their parents are poor. Among students with Nigerian or Ghanaian origins, only one in five do. It is also noteworthy that black Caribbean students are twice as likely to be excluded from school as black African students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy in educational attainment is just as stark. On average, 58% of black African students graduate from middle school at grade level (defined as achieving A* to C grades at GCSE)—about the same number as white students. But black Caribbean students are significantly less likely to do so—while those whose parents hail from Nigeria actually outperform their white peers by a considerable margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to disavow the label “black British.” But we need to invest it with the nuance consonant with its reality—and to cast doubt on the idea that every discrepancy in representation must be explained by structural injustice or white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has, for example, been a lot of concern about the underrepresentation of black Britons in professions like the arts and publishing. But why would you choose to go into theater or journalism—rather than law, medicine or finance—if you are a talented child of ambitious but not well off immigrants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a flippant question. While representation can be important, anybody who actually wants to improve the condition of black Britons should at least be a little curious about why they are overrepresented in some prestigious professions and underrepresented in others. In a country in which black people make up only three percent of the population, for example, six percent of junior doctors are black. Would the country—or the black community—really benefit if more black Britons chose to ditch medicine for the theater? The debate is worth having. But in the place of that debate, there have only been pious paeans to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereotype of the West African parent who wants their child to study law or medicine bears some relation to reality; but the widespread view of black people as perennial victims devoid of agency is a defamatory abstraction. The black person in Britain, like Ralph Ellison’s iconic protagonist, is “invisible because no one wants to see him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of the British reaction to the death of George Floyd has constituted a failure of nerve. Desperately seeking to assuage their feelings of guilt, to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, many Britons have sacrificed their critical faculties to a narrative that does not actually help black people—a narrative that, by reducing us to passive abstractions, only makes us more invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racists assume that black people are all the same. Ironically, anti-racists sometimes do so too. But anybody who is truly committed to racial equality needs to recognize that this kind of simplification neither serves justice nor reflects the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is giving $1B to publishers to help convince governments not to take more</title>
<link>https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/google-is-giving-1-billion-to-news-publishers-to-help-convince-governments-not-to-take-a-whole-lot-more-than-that/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/google-is-giving-1-billion-to-news-publishers-to-help-convince-governments-not-to-take-a-whole-lot-more-than-that/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Good news! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/google-will-spend-1-billion-to-pay-publishers-for-news-showcase-501feeae-0e3e-4822-8711-1c64052e27f1.html&quot;&gt;Google’s going to spend $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next three years paying publishers for their news. Specifically, the money will license publishers’ content for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase&quot;&gt;new feature in Google News called Google News Showcase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a billion dollars that publishers didn’t have before, and it’s better to have a billion dollars than to not have a billion dollars. (Or so I’m told.) I am squarely in the take-the-money camp here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-relatedstory&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;embed-relatedstory-imagelink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/?relatedstory&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-unsplash-315x177.jpg&quot; class=&quot;embed-relatedstory-image wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-unsplash-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-unsplash-220x124.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
But you have to remember: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/&quot;&gt;Google’s interactions with the news industry are always fundamentally about &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; interests, not publishers’.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing unusual or wrong with that, really; “working to advance your own interests” is a pretty common thread throughout capitalism. It’s what corporations do! But you should keep that in mind before being bowled over by a 10-digit number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when a corporate announcement like this seems to make &lt;em&gt;no sense at all&lt;/em&gt; from a straight profit-and-loss perspective, it’s probably about meeting a deeper need somewhere else — in this case, Google’s need to be beloved enough to remain underregulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/&quot;&gt;argued in June&lt;/a&gt; — the last time the company got that coveted “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/media/google-news-publishers/index.html&quot;&gt;Google will start paying publishers for news&lt;/a&gt;” headline — the tech giants are generally fine with the idea of writing publishers some big checks. They’ve got the money, after all, and publishers’ complaints about the duopoly are a longtime headache and a PR problem. If Google and Facebook can find a dollar figure that would make that go away, they’ll do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key, though, is that it has to be done on the companies’ terms — not publishers’, and certainly not (shiver) governments’. Here’s what they want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They want to pick which publishers get the money. And they want to determine (and keep quiet) how much each one gets. They don’t want this to become an obligation owed equally to everyone who publishes anything on the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want the money to “pay” for some small new side product, not their big moneymakers (search for Google, the News Feed for Facebook). They want to make sure the deal isn’t: “We’re giving publishers back some of the money they think we steal from them everyday.” It’s: “Let’s partner on something new.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want the money to earn them happy headlines like “Google Pledges $1 Billion to News Publishers,” get the press off their backs, and ideally lower the heat on calls for government regulation or taxation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s announcement today checks all three boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is picking what countries it wants to start licensing news in and what publishers it wants to license from. Google News Showcase currently has “nearly 200” publishers in Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, the U.K., and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some countries, the announced partners are the big brands you might expect — like Spiegel, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Zeit in Germany, or Folha de S. Paolo, Estadão, and UOL in Brazil. In others, though, the choices are a little confusing. In Canada, the launch partners are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.narcitymedia.com/&quot;&gt;Narcity Media&lt;/a&gt; (owner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mtlblog.com/&quot;&gt;a blog about Montreal&lt;/a&gt;) and Sault Ste. Marie-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.villagemedia.ca/&quot;&gt;Village Media&lt;/a&gt; (owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.villagemedia.ca/subdivisions/&quot;&gt;16 hyperlocal sites in Ontario&lt;/a&gt;) — but not, say, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, or the major Postmedia regional dailies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing connects them all: In each of the six countries announced, Google is or has been a target of antitrust efforts or other attempts to rein in its market power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google wants it to be clear that it doesn’t consider this money to be compensation for some wrong they’ve done to publishers. (For the record, I think the important “wrong” Google has done to publishers is to outcompete them — make products for advertisers and consumers that both groups find much more compelling than what publishers offer. But most publishers don’t see it that way.) Instead, this is for something new, a fresh chance to make a fresh financial arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase&quot;&gt;Here’s CEO Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt; describing Google News Showcase — and, by the way, Pichai being the frontman for this announcement is a good sign of how much PR value Google sees here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This financial commitment — our biggest to date — will pay publishers to create and curate high-quality content for a different kind of online news experience. Google News Showcase is a new product that will benefit both publishers and readers: It features the editorial curation of award-winning newsrooms to give readers more insight on the stories that matter, and in the process, helps publishers develop deeper relationships with their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Showcase is made up of story panels that will appear initially in Google News on Android. The product will launch soon on Google News on iOS, and will come to Google Discover and Search in the future. These panels give participating publishers the ability to package the stories that appear within Google’s news products, providing deeper storytelling and more context through features like timelines, bullets and related articles. Other components like video, audio and daily briefings will come next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is distinct from our other news products because it leans on the editorial choices individual publishers make about which stories to show readers and how to present them. It will start rolling out today to readers in Brazil and Germany, and will expand to other countries in the coming months where local frameworks support these partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SHOWCASE_GIF-DE_BR_1_DyV4xWQ.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the thing: Google will make roughly zero dollars off of Google News Showcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;: It’s a part of Google News, which runs zero advertising and thus generates zero revenue. Google is proud of this fact! It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://australia.googleblog.com/2019/02/our-response-to-accc-digital-platforms.html&quot;&gt;bragged about it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/france-tells-google-to-pay-for-linking-to-content-but-google-says-no-137109&quot;&gt;to regulators&lt;/a&gt; and publishers when they come sniffing around for money for news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even if Google News Showcase is a big hit and it drives a gazillion people to Google News every day, it still won’t make Google any money. (Just as the News Tab won’t make Facebook any money.) And even if spreads to other Google platforms, publisher-curated collections of top stories are never going to be a hugely impactful part of what Google users want. (If someone wants to see what the L.A. Times thinks are its most important stories, they’ll go to latimes.com, or launch its app, or check @latimes on Twitter — not go figure out whatever tortured search request might pop up these story panels. And in any event, Google only rarely monetizes news-based searches with ads anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;: It &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be a big hit and drive a gazillion people to Google News every day. It’s a module a few screens down in an app on your phone that publishers can choose to do some customizations on. It looks fine! But it doesn’t change the value proposition of Google News in any significant way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And third&lt;/em&gt;: Even if it really, really liked the idea of Google News Showcase, Google wouldn’t have to pay publishers $1 billion to make it happen. Its existing algorithms can assemble a collection of a publication’s best stories and put some nice-looking art on top, all without any human or publisher involvement. The same fair-use rules that apply to the rest of Google News would apply here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Google &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to lean into the slightly more editorial things about Showcase — like pulling out a few bullet points or making a timeline — it could just hire a few editors in each country and have &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; do it. That’s how Twitter does it with Moments and how Facebook used to do it with Trending. Hiring those people would cost a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, if Google just &lt;em&gt;gave&lt;/em&gt; publishers the tools to highlight whatever work they want to highlight in something like Showcase, I’d bet most publishers would gladly do it for them — for free! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2011/09/with-its-standout-tag-google-news-is-giving-publishers-new-incentive-to-credit-the-competition/&quot;&gt;As they did once before&lt;/a&gt;, a decade ago.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is Google spending $1 billion on a product that will earn nothing, will be used by only a small fraction of its users, and won’t make reading headlines more than, what, maybe 5% better? Well, remember my third rule of duopoly checks to publishers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They want the money to earn them happy headlines like “Google Pledges $1 Billion to News Publishers,” get the press off their backs, and ideally lower the heat on calls for government regulation or taxation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A billion dollars is a nice, big, memorable number. I wouldn’t even be shocked if this idea started with “Let’s give them $1 billion, that’ll sound awesome next time we have to testify before Congress,” with the years, scope, and details worked out backward from there. The money is certainly welcome if you’re a publisher in tough straits. But it won’t change much about any single publisher’s financial fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s $1 billion &lt;em&gt;over three years&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;across the entire planet earth&lt;/em&gt;. Newspapers alone are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/260201/newspaper-revenue-worldwide-by-source/&quot;&gt;$94 billion annual business worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Multiply that by three years, and then add in all the broadcasters, magazines, and digital-first publishers who’ll also get some piece of this pie, and pretty soon it becomes clear that $1 billion doesn’t change the industry’s fundamental math. Just as the checks Facebook is writing for its News Tab haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Google can afford it. If its revenues keep growing over the next three years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue&quot;&gt;at the same rate they have over the past three years&lt;/a&gt;, Google will earn something like $632 billion in revenues over that span — about two-thirds of it coming from its advertising business. One billion dollars would be roughly 0.15 percent of that. It’s not &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s also nothing that’ll put any strain on future budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Google’s giant pile of ad dollars is looking mighty appealing to regulators and lawmakers around the world these days, who increasingly see it as a target for healthy taxation. And “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90559110/google-will-pay-publishers-1-billion-to-quell-claims-of-unfairly-profiting-from-their-content?icid=dan902:754:0:editRecirc&quot;&gt;Google is hurting our local news providers&lt;/a&gt;” is one of the key rhetorical messages of those who want to take some of the company’s money or power away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Maryland, for instance, the head of the state senate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/taxing-digital-ads-could-bring-maryland-250-million--and-a-hefty-legal-challenge/2020/01/29/8f2b2014-42ba-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html&quot;&gt;introduced a bill earlier this year that would hit digital advertising targeted at the state’s residents&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.eversheds-sutherland.com/NewsCommentary/Legal-Alerts/229538/Legal-Alert-Marylands-digital-advertising-tax-bill-passes-out-of-committee-with-amendments&quot;&gt;excise tax of up to 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The tax would only apply to companies with total annual of at least $100 million — so it’s meant to go after the coffers of Google, Facebook, and their ilk. But a $100 million cutoff would also mean hitting companies like Tribune Publishing, which owns The Baltimore Sun; before the pandemic hit, Tribune was pulling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995431/0/en/Tribune-Publishing-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results.html&quot;&gt;around $25 million a quarter&lt;/a&gt; in digital ad revenue alone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill passed the state’s House and Senate — but was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-vetoes-sweeping-education-plan-citing-economic-downturn/2020/05/07/de9046da-905c-11ea-9e23-6914ee410a5f_story.html&quot;&gt;vetoed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nebraska state senator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidesalt.com/2020/01/new-trend-developing-another-digital-advertising-tax-proposal/&quot;&gt;introduced a similar bill&lt;/a&gt; that would make digital advertising targeted at Nebraskans subject to state and local sales tax — between 5.5% and 7.5%, depending on the jurisdiction. (The bill hasn’t made much progress.) And groups like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/2019-02/Beyond-Fixing-Facebook-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;Free Press have called for similar taxes&lt;/a&gt; on the tech giant’s ad revenue; they suggest a 2% tax that would generate about $1.8 billion a year for an endowment for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/opinion/tax-facebook-google.html&quot;&gt;even a Nobel laureate in economics, Paul Romer, likes the idea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the job of government to prevent a tragedy of the commons. That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax that I propose would be applied to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, which are the key to the operation of Facebook, Google and the like. At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, none of these has become law, and if one does, it’ll face a variety of legal challenges. Google has good lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has gotten used to governments around the world looking for ways to pull some of its revenues into state coffers. But it’s one thing for those attempts to come in regulation-happy places like Europe or Australia — it’s another for them to come on its American home turf. And the fact that that bill got through Maryland’s legislature probably made the threat of taxation feel a lot more real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s really what this is at its core: a way for Google to send money to publishers in a way that it hopes will address a PR problem and stave off hungry governments. Think about it: This morning was theoretically the debut of a new Google product. But its announcement is filed away in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/&quot;&gt;“Outreach and Initiatives” section&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s site — the place where it talks about all the good work it does on climate change and sustainability and helping kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could possibly make a company want to give away 0.15% of its revenue? The threat of someone else taking 10% of it.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>The money, spread over three years and the entire globe, is welcome — but this is PR, not a product.</og:description>
