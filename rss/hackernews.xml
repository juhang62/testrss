<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06776&quot;&gt;A generalised solution to distributed consensus&lt;/a&gt; Howard &amp;amp; Mortier, &lt;em&gt;arXiv’19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a draft paper that Heidi Howard recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1098167557792718849?s=21&quot;&gt;shared with the world via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/2019/02/towards-an-intuitive-high-performance-consensus-algorithm/&quot;&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It caught my eye for promising a generalised solution to the consensus problem, and also for using reasoning over immutable state to get there. The state maintained at each server is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/06/keeping-calm-when-distributed-consistency-is-easy/&quot;&gt;monotonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/03/01/cant-we-all-just-agree/&quot;&gt;notoriously hard problem&lt;/a&gt;, and Howard has been deep in the space for several years now. See for example the 2016 paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;. The quest for the holy grail here is to find a unifying and easily understandable protocol that can be instantiated in different configurations allowing different trade-offs to be made according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper re-examines the problem of distributed consensus with the aim of improving performance and understanding. We proceed as follows. Once we have defined the problem of consensus, we propose a generalised solution to consensus that uses only immutable state to enable more intuitive reasoning about correctness. We subsequently prove that both Paxos and Fast Paxos are instances of our generalised consensus algorithm and thus show that both algorithms are conservative in their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The distributed consensus problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a set of servers (at least two) that need to agree upon a value. Clients take as input a value to be written, and produce as output the value agreed by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The output value must have been the input value of a client (ruling out simple solutions that always output a fixed value for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients that produce an output must output the same value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients must eventually produce an output if the system is reliable and synchronous for a sufficient period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re talking here about the ‘inner game’ – this is just to agree upon a single value, whereas in a real deployment we’ll probably run multiple rounds of the protocol to agree upon a series of values. Moreover, we’re assuming here that the set of clients and servers is fixed and known to the clients. The ‘clients’ are probably not end-user clients, but more likely to be system processes making using of a consensus service. Configuration changes and membership epochs is another layer we’ll probably add-on in real deployments, but is also out of scope here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building blocks: immutable registers and quorums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fixed set of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; servers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0%2C+S_1%2C+...%2C+S_n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; title=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. Each server has a tape it can write to, aka, an infinite array of &lt;strong&gt;write-once&lt;/strong&gt; persistent registers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_0%2C+R_1%2C+...&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; title=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the tape is blank – all registers are &lt;em&gt;unwritten&lt;/em&gt;. Once we write a value in a register slot it can never be changed. In addition to values provided by clients the system has one special value, denoted &lt;em&gt;nil&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be interested in sets of values from the same register slot across all servers. A &lt;em&gt;register set&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; title=&quot;i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is the set of all registers &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_i&quot; title=&quot;R_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; across all servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enough of the registers in a register set have the same (non- &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;) value, then we will say that the servers have &lt;em&gt;decided&lt;/em&gt; upon that value. How many registers in a register set is &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; though? That’s something we get to decide as part of the configuration of the protocol. In fact, we specify more than just the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of register values that must be in agreement, we also specify which servers they belong to. A (non-empty) subset of servers that can decide a value between them is called a &lt;em&gt;quorum&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, “&lt;em&gt;a quorum, Q, is a (non-empty) subset of servers, such that if all servers have the same (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; in the same register then &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is said to be decided.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word ‘quorum’ is often strongly associated with ‘majority,’ but note that this doesn’t have to be the case. The specification allows us to declare a quorum containing just a single server if we want to. The dictionary definition of quorum is “the minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.” Note that there is also no requirement here for overlapping quorum memberships (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each register set is associated with a set of quorums. That is, on a register-set by register-set basis, we can specify exactly which subsets of servers are allowed to decide a value. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-1.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why on earth we would want to have different quorum sets for different register sets— since we’re only agreeing on a single value at the end of the day!— will become more apparent when we look at how to layer a consensus protocol on top of the registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given quorum configurations and register values for register sets, we can see if any quorum is satisfied and a decision reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of all registers can be represented in a table, known as a &lt;em&gt;state table&lt;/em&gt;, where each column represents the state of one server and each row represents a register set. By combining a configuration with a state table, we can determine whether any decision(s) have been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-2.jpeg?w=520&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to be a little careful here and remember that the state table is a logical construct. Each server knows the values of its own registers, and clients can maintain their own view of the global state table as they receive information from servers. Given the immutable constructs though, we know that once a client has assembled enough information to call a value decided, it is finally decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some rules that need to be followed for this to work as a consensus system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quorum agreement&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only output a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; if it has read &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; from a quorum of servers in the same register set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New value&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided that &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is the client’s input value or that the client has read &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; from a register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current decision&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; to register &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; on server &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;s&quot; title=&quot;s&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided that if &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is decided in register set &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; by a quorum &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+%5Cin+Q_r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;Q \in Q_r&quot; title=&quot;Q \in Q_r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin+Q&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;s \in Q&quot; title=&quot;s \in Q&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; then no value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v'&quot; title=&quot;v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cneq+v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; title=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; can also be decided in register set &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value to register &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided no value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v'&quot; title=&quot;v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cneq+v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; title=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; can be decided by the quorums in registers sets 0 to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+-+1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r - 1&quot; title=&quot;r - 1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two rules are pretty straightforward. Rule 3 ensures that all decisions made by a register set will be for the same value, while rule 4 ensures that all decisions made by different register sets are for the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeying these rules places some further constraints on the system configuration. Say we have two quorums for register set &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_0%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_1%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. A client writing to the register on &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0&quot; title=&quot;S_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has no way of knowing whether or not some other client might be writing a different value to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_1&quot; title=&quot;S_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;, hence we couldn’t uphold rule 3. There are three ways we can handle this situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trivial solution is to allow only one quorum per register set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With multiple quorums, we can require that all quorums for a register set intersect (i.e., any two quorums will have at least one overlapping member)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;em&gt;client restricted configurations&lt;/em&gt;. Here ownership of a given register set is assigned to a given client, such that only that client can write values in that register set. Assuming the client is consistent with the values it writes, all will be well. One such strategy would be a round-robin ownership of register sets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-4.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comply with rule 4, clients need to consult their emerging view of the global state table, aka their &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; state table, and figure out whether any decision has been or could be reached by earlier register sets. The client maintains a decision table with one entry for each quorum of each register set. This table tracks what the client knows about the decisions made by the quorum. Possible values for a quorum are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ANY – any value could yet be decided. (All quorums for all register sets start out in this state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAYBE &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – if this quorum reaches a decision, then the value will be &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DECIDED &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – the value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has been decided by the quorum (a final state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NONE – the quorum will not decide a value; a final state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the client receives information from servers, it updates the decision table according to the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients use the decision table to implement the four rules for correctness as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-5.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to make reasoning about correctness sufficiently intuitive that proofs are not necessary to make a convincing case for the safety…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be pleased to know however that proofs &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; included, and you’ll find them in Appendix A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paxos over immutable registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a paper summary, I guess this write-up so far has been a spectacular fail! I’m already over my target length, and have probably taken more words to explain the core ideas than the original paper does!! The only defence I can offer is that there are no short-cuts when it comes to thinking about consensus 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the paper is to show that the register-based scheme just outlined can be instantiated to realise a number of consensus schemes from the literature, including Paxos and Fast Paxos. I’m out of space to do that proper justice, but here’s a sneak-peek at the core Paxos algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that Paxos is a conservative instance of our generalised solution to consensus. The configuration used by Paxos is majorities for all register sets.. Paxos also uses client restricted for all register sets. The purpose of phase one is to implement rule 4, and the purpose of phase two is to implement rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-8.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you differentiate between the quorums used for each register set and which phase of Paxos the quorum is used for, you can arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mixing it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5 of the paper shows how to derive Fast Paxos, and in section six you’ll find a brief sketch of three other points in the configuration space named co-located consensus, fixed-majority consensus, and reconfigurable consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we have reframed the problem of distributed consensus in terms of write-once registers and thus proposed a generalised solution to distributed consensus. We have demonstrated that this solution not only uniﬁes existing algorithms including Paxos and Fast Paxos but also demonstrates that such algorithms are conservative as their quorum intersection requirements and quorum agreement rules can be substantially weakened. We have illustrated the power of our generalised consensus algorithm by proposing three novel algorithms for consensus, demonstrating a few interesting points on the diverse array of algorithms made possible by our abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mission of SpaceX’s new astronaut taxi is in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast today (March 8) at 8:45 a.m. EST (1345 GMT), wrapping up a &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;1&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-demo-1-test-flight-photos.html&quot;&gt;historic mission to the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no astronauts aboard this flight, &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;2&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-dummy-called-ripley.html&quot;&gt;only the sensor-packed dummy Ripley&lt;/a&gt; named after a character from the “Alien” films. But the success of the test flight, known as Demo-1, helps paves the way for a crewed mission of the SpaceX vehicle, perhaps as early as this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be a huge milestone when it comes; astronauts haven’t launched to orbit from American soil since NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fifty years after humans landed on the moon for the first time, America has driven a golden spike on the trail to new space exploration feats through the work of our commercial partner&lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;6&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html&quot;&gt; SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and all of the dedicated and talented flight controllers at NASA and our international partners,” NASA astronaut Anne McClain radioed Mission Control from the ISS when Crew Dragon undocked from the orbiting lab earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new era in human spaceflight,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Wednesday (March 6) during a webcast event with Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke to McClain and Canadian Space Agency’s David Saint-Jacques from NASA’s Mission Control center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA officials said there was a bit of Apollo history involved in today’s Crew Dragon splashdown: It came  nearly 50 years to the day after the Apollo 9 spacecraft returned to Earth in the same area on March 13, 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A pioneering flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is currently dependent on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to ferry its astronauts to and from the ISS. And this service isn’t cheap; each seat on the three-person Soyuz currently sells for about $80 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in 2014, NASA signed commercial-crew contracts with SpaceX and Boeing—worth $2.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively—to foster the development of homegrown American spaceships. Like SpaceX, Boeing is building a capsule, called &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;8&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/19367-boeing-cst-100.html&quot;&gt;CST-100 Starliner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the contracts were signed, NASA officials said they hoped these private spaceships would be up and running by the end of 2017. That didn’t happen, of course. But both companies are now getting pretty close, as Demo-1 shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission began Saturday morning (March 2) with a &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;9&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-crew-dragon-test-flight.html&quot;&gt;liftoff atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket&lt;/a&gt; from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Crew Dragon carried Ripley and about 450 lbs. (200 kilograms) of supplies for the ISS crew. Also aboard was the adorable “Little Earth” Celestial Buddies plush toy as a “zero-g” indicator. That toy will remain aboard the station—it will be retrieved by SpaceX’s first astroanut crew later this year—but Crew Dragon did return about 330 lbs. (150 kg) of experiment results and other gear to Earth on this flight, NASA officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of Demo-1 was to test the capsule’s many systems in flight, to make sure Crew Dragon is ready to carry astronauts. And the private spacecraft seems to have hit all its marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crew Dragon docked autonomously at the ISS Sunday morning (March 3) and then stayed attached to the orbiting lab for five days. The capsule departed at 2:32 a.m. EST (0732 GMT) today, survived the fiery descent through Earth’s atmosphere, deployed its parachutes and splashed down gently into the Atlantic’s rolling waves, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) off the Florida coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this was routine. Crew Dragon is based on SpaceX’s &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;10&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/12033-spacex-dragon-space-capsule-infographic.html&quot;&gt;robotic Dragon freighter&lt;/a&gt;, which has been flying resupply missions to the ISS under a separate NASA contract since 2012. But the two capsules are very different, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dragon 2, or Crew Dragon, is a fundamental redesign,” Musk said during a postlaunch news conference Saturday. There’s “hardly a part in common with Dragon 1,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Crew Dragon has seats, windows, a life-support system, touch-screen controls, emergency-escape thrusters and other astronaut-related accoutrements that the cargo version lacks. Crew Dragon also docks directly with the ISS, whereas its older cousin must be grappled by the orbiting lab’s huge robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the crew-carrying capsule has a different parachute system and back-shell shape, neither of which had shown its mettle during an orbital mission. So, a successful return to Earth today was &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;11&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-earth-return-challenging.html&quot;&gt;far from guaranteed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see hypersonic re-entry as probably my greatest concern,” Musk said during Saturday’s news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crewed flight coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming months will be packed with big milestones for both SpaceX and Boeing, if all goes according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next for SpaceX is a test of Crew Dragon’s emergency-escape system, which is designed to get the capsule to safety if a serious problem were to occur during launch. This uncrewed flight, which is currently &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;12&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2019/02/06/nasa-partners-update-commercial-crew-launch-dates/&quot;&gt;targeted for June&lt;/a&gt;, will employ the same capsule that just came back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that—possibly as early as July—will come Demo-2, Crew Dragon’s astronaut-carrying debut. This landmark test flight will tote NASA’s Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to and from the ISS. Operational, contracted missions, each of which will ferry four astronauts, will commence sometime thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Starliner’s first uncrewed test mission to the ISS could launch as soon as next month. The Boeing capsule’s emergency-escape test and first crewed demonstration flight to the orbiting lab will occur no earlier than May and August, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It won’t be long before our astronaut colleagues are aboard Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner vehicles,” McClain said. “And we can’t wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Updates from YC</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/updates-from-yc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/updates-from-yc/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We have a few updates about YC to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is transitioning to Chairman of YC and has shifted his operational responsibilities at YC to other partners. This change will allow Sam to spend more time focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; while still being responsible, along with the rest of the partnership, for the long-term social and economic success of YC. Because YC is run as a partnership, there will be no significant operational change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going well — in the past two years, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/introducing-yc-series-a-batches/&quot;&gt;the Series A program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-stage-program/&quot;&gt;the YC Growth program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workatastartup.com/&quot;&gt;Work at a Startup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-china-qi-lu/&quot;&gt;YC China&lt;/a&gt;. The current total market capitalization of YC companies is around $150 billion. The YC network now has over 4,000 alumni and 1,900 companies, and it has become a reliable source of advice, customers, friendship, and support for YC founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had over 12,000 applicants for the Winter 2019 batch. This was a 30% increase compared to the Summer 2018 batch. We had two choices—either we reject a lot of great founders, or we figure out how to grow the batch. We decided to grow. We funded over 200 companies this batch, an increase of 25% compared to S18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That necessitated some changes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday/faq/&quot;&gt;Demo Day&lt;/a&gt;. We will now have two stages running in parallel over two days, allowing more time for investors to interact with founders off-stage. With a larger space, we’ve been able to invite many more investors so that investment firms can send more people. (For those investors who want to watch every pitch, we record the presentations and make them available to watch on our Demo Day website.) Because of these changes, we had to move to a new venue. We had been talking for some time about moving to San Francisco, and this seemed like the natural time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of San Francisco, we are considering moving YC to the city and are currently looking for space. The center of gravity for new startups has clearly shifted over the past five years, and although we love our space in Mountain View, we are rethinking whether the logistical tradeoff is worth it, especially given how difficult the commute has become. We also want to be closer to our Bay Area alumni, who disproportionately live and work in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we’ve gotten better at serving and being more accessible to founders who live around the world. Startup School is our free online program to teach people how to start a startup and to provide advice and community. Last year we had 10,500 companies participate. We’re particularly proud that 30% of the companies in this current batch came from Startup School! Our mission with this program is to bring the cost of knowledge, community, and tools to start a startup way down. Going forward, everyone who wants to do Startup School will be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we continue to scale up our Series A program, which helps our companies raise an A round when they’re ready. In the last twelve months, there were 96 Series As across the YC portfolio, and the Series A program helped 67 of those companies raise their rounds. We also started running Series A batches, modeled after the classic YC batches, and have created an investor portal to help more investors to get access to YC Series As.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Animals are no less emotional than we are</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/sunday/emotions-animals-humans.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/sunday/emotions-animals-humans.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Uniquely human emotions don’t exist. More and more, I believe that we share all emotions with other species in the same way that we share virtually every organ in our bodies with them. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like organs, the emotions evolved over millions of years to serve essential functions. Their usefulness has been tested again and again, giving them the wisdom of ages. They nudge us to do what is best for us. Some emotions may be more developed in humans, or apply to a wider range of circumstances, but none is fundamentally new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is not the prevailing view in science, though. The most popular theory proposes only six “primary” or “basic” emotions, which are universally recognized by their facial expressions, like anger (frowning stare), happiness (laugh and smile), and fear (eyes wide open, lips stretched horizontally). All other emotions are “secondary,” which means that they are cultural constructs that make us human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But does anyone truly believe that just because an emotion lacks a specific face, we can claim it for ourselves? Open your front door and tell your dog that you are going out for a walk, then close the door and return to your seat. Your dog, who had been barking and wriggling with excitement, now slinks back to his basket and puts his head down on his paws. You have just witnessed both hope and disappointment in another species, even though neither counts as a basic emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;You may say that it is impossible to know what a dog feels. True, yet his behavior clearly reflects an abrupt change in his emotional state. Expressed in the body, these states are perfectly observable and measurable even if the associated private experiences are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In fact, the possibility of animal hope was experimented upon nearly a century ago by the psychologist Otto Tinklepaugh. He first let a monkey watch a banana being hidden under a cup, then allowed her into the room where this had been done. If she found the banana, everything proceeded smoothly. But if the experimenter had surreptitiously replaced the banana with a piece of lettuce, the monkey would frantically look around, lifting up the cup, while shrieking at the experimenter. Her expectations had been violated, for which she rightly blamed the sneaky experimenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We share so many so-called secondary emotions with other species that the whole concept is questionable. There is one exception, though, which keeps being proposed as definitely cultural: guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is despite the many dog owners who seem to recognize it in their pets when they hide under the table after a transgression. One expert in animal cognition at Barnard, Alexandra Horowitz, tested this out by having dogs meet an angry owner both when they had not broken any rules and when they had; she also had them meet a relaxed owner in the same two situations. Dr. Horowitz concluded that whether dogs take on a guilty look — lowered gaze, ears pressed back, tail rapidly beating between the legs — is unrelated to whether or not they followed orders. If the owner scolds them, they look extremely guilty. If the owner doesn’t, they still sometimes look like this, but less often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One problem, however, is that our rules are of our own making, such as “Don’t jump on that couch!” or “Keep your nails off my leather chair!” It must be as tough for our pets to grasp these prohibitions as it was for me to understand why I couldn’t chew gum in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It would be better to test behavior that is wrong by almost any standard, including that of their own species. The Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz gave one of my favorite examples, about his dog, Bully, who broke the fundamental rule never to bite your superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Humans don’t need to teach this rule, and indeed Bully had never been punished for it. The dog bit his master’s hand when Dr. Lorenz tried to break up a dogfight. Even though Dr. Lorenz petted him right away, Bully suffered a complete nervous breakdown. For days, he was virtually paralyzed and ignored his food. He would lie on the rug breathing shallowly, occasionally interrupted by a deep sigh. He had violated a natural taboo, which among ancestral canines could have had the worst imaginable consequences, such as expulsion from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among the primates, the most suggestive cases of remorse concern bonobos. These apes are as close to us as chimpanzees, but far more peaceful and gentle, which means that they almost never hurt one another. Whereas in most primates reconciliation after a fight is typically sought by the subordinate party, in bonobos it is the dominant animal that seeks to make amends, especially if he has inflicted an injury. He may return to his victim and unerringly reach for the exact same toe that he has bitten and carefully inspect the damage. He obviously knows precisely what he has done and where. Then he spends half an hour or more licking and cleaning the wound that he himself inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Another human emotion that has been elevated to a special status is disgust. In his book “Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique,” the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga views disgust as one of the five emotional modules that set us apart from all other animals. Here, too, dogs are a prime example, given that they eat feces and lick their testicles. This is taken as proof that dogs must lack disgust. But give your dog a cut lemon (not recommended) and you will see a full-blown yuck! response with curled-up lips, drooling and withdrawal from the sour smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Disgust is an incredibly adaptive response. Every organism needs to avoid parasites and prevent the ingestion of harmful foods (citrus fruits can be poisonous to canines). Ignoring this mundane origin, however, psychologists have fallen in love with the moral connotations of this emotion. We are disgusted, for example, by someone who fakes a racist attack on himself to gain positive media attention. We “turn up our noses” at such people, showing our typical disgust face with wrinkled nose and narrowed eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But even if moral disgust is special, it is no accident that our facial expression also blocks wafts of foul air from getting into our eyes and nostrils. This hints at the emotion’s origin. Chimpanzees show the same expression when it rains, something they hate. As soon as a downpour starts, young and old pull an ugly face known as the “rain face,” in which they bring their upper lip close to their nose and stick out their lower lip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Having grown up in the Netherlands, I know this expression firsthand from watching the throngs of cyclists in Dutch cities. Whenever it pours, they show rain faces inside their plastic ponchos, evidence of their dismay over the prospect of wet clothes for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Disgust is in fact so predictable in apes that an adolescent chimp I saw regularly at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, in Georgia, turned it into a game. The chimp, Tara, would occasionally find a dead rat in the outdoor enclosure and carry it around by its tail, careful to keep it away from her own body, then stealthily lay it on the back head of a sleeping group mate. Her victim would startle as soon as she felt (or smelled) the dead animal, loudly screaming and wildly shaking her body to get this foul thing off her. She might even rub the spot on her body with a fistful of grass, to make sure the smell was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tara, for her part, would simply pick up the rat and move on to her next target. Apart from the question of why she considered this game fun, and why we humans immediately see its humor value, it would obviously never have worked in a species that lacked disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But that is not all. We also have experimental studies, such as those by the primatologists Cécile Sarabian and Andrew MacIntosh at Kyoto University, who explore the yuck! factor in wild macaques on a Japanese beach. They place small food items, like grains or peanuts, on top of a variety of objects. Some of these objects are piles of plastic made to look like feces; some are actual piles of fresh feces. Most of the monkeys are disgusted enough by the latter to forgo the food. And if they do pick up food from the feces, they frantically rub their hands afterward. Tested in the same way, bonobos refuse to touch banana slices contaminated by feces. Given how much apes love bananas, this attests to their deep revulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the longest time, science has depicted animals as stimulus-response machines while declaring their inner lives barren. This has helped us sustain our customary “anthropodenial”: the denial that we are animals. We like to see ourselves as special, but whatever the difference between humans and animals may be, it is unlikely to be found in the emotional domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hard disks can be turned into listening devices</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/07/hard_drive_eavesdropping/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/07/hard_drive_eavesdropping/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It's not just the walls that have ears. It's also the hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eggheads at the University of Michigan in the US, and Zhejiang University in China, have found that hard disk drives (HDDs) can be turned into listening devices, using malicious firmware and signal processing calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a study titled &quot;Hard Drive of Hearing: Disks that Eavesdrop with a Synthesized Microphone,&quot; computer scientists Andrew Kwong, Wenyuan Xu, and Kevin Fu describe an acoustic side-channel that can be accessed by measuring how sound waves make hard disk parts vibrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our research demonstrates that the mechanical components in magnetic hard disk drives behave as microphones with sufficient precision to extract and parse human speech,&quot; their paper, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; ahead of its formal publication, stated. &quot;These unintentional microphones sense speech with high enough fidelity for the Shazam service to recognize a song recorded through the hard drive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's research work, scheduled to be presented in May at the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019/&quot;&gt;2019 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, explores how it's possible to alter HDD firmware to measure the offset of a disk drive's read/write head from the center of the track it's seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offset is referred to as the Positional Error Signal (PES) and hard drives monitor this signal to keep the read/write head in the optimal position for reading and writing data. PES measurements must be very fine because drive heads can only be off by a few nanometers before data errors arise. The sensitivity of the gear, however, means human speech is sufficient to move the needle, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These extremely precise measurements are sensitive to vibrations caused by the slightest fluctuations in air pressure, such as those induced by human vocalizations,&quot; the paper explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrations from HDD parts don't yield particularly good sound, but with digital filtering techniques, human speech can be discerned, given the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/07/20/loud.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;loud&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Nordic Nasdaq knocked as deleterious decibels crashed servers&quot;&gt;Noise from blast of gas destroys Digiplex data depot disk drives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/26/decibels_destroy_disk_drives_in_digiplex_data_centre/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashing HDD firmware is a prerequisite for the snooping, the paper says, because the ATA protocol does not expose the PES. This could be accomplished through traditional attack techniques – binary exploitation, drive-by downloads, or phishing – or by intercepting HDDs somewhere in the supply chain and modifying them. The researchers point to the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/17/kaspersky_labs_equation_group/&quot;&gt;Grayfish&lt;/a&gt; malware attributed to the Equation Group as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exfiltrate captured data, the three boffins suggest transmitting it over the internet by modifying Linux operating system files to create a reverse shell with root privileges or storing it to disk for physical recovery at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many computing devices come with microphones that might look like easier targets for hijacking, the researchers observe that security conscious individuals may disable known microphones in software or with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://stahlke.org/dan/phonemute/&quot;&gt;hardware hacks&lt;/a&gt;. A hard disk-focused attack would be less expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look, let's be real: for the vast, vast majority of people, this is all just a cunning academic exploitation of hard drive technology. No one's really going to bug you via your spinning rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... if they were to, the PES sampling rate (34.56 kHz) allows the capture of audio signals up to 17.28 kHz, which covers almost all of human hearing (20 Hz–20 kHz) and is significantly better than the sampling rate of the telephone system (8 kHz). Since the PES data amounts to air pressure readings, the researchers simply turned the series of PES measurements into linear pulse-code modulation values and then converted these samples into sound via digital signal processing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wait, there's a catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limiting aspect of the described technique is that it requires a fairly loud conversation in the vicinity of the eavesdropping hard drive. To record comprehensible speech, the conversation had to reach 85 dBA, with 75 dBA being the low threshold for capturing muffled sound. To get Shazam to identify recordings captured through a hard drive, the source file had to be played at 90 dBA. Which is pretty loud. Like lawn mower or food blender loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge this is louder than most practical scenarios but they say they &quot;expect that an attacker using state of the art filtering and voice recognition algorithms can substantially amplify the channel’s strength.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the growing popularity of solid state drives diminish the risk even further, there were still twice as many hard drives sold with PCs in 2017 as there were solid state drives, the researchers claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent HDDs from being turned into microphones, the trio suggest hard drive makers sign firmware cryptographically and use TLS when distributing updates to prevent MITM attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also note that their work may open future research possibilities, such as using a hard disk's read/write head as a crude sounds generator to issue spoken commands to nearby connected speakers like Alexa, Google Home, and Siri. ®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're suffering deja-vu, the paper cites Alfredo Ortega's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poktHJzvDX0&quot;&gt;earlier work&lt;/a&gt; on using hard disks as microphones, although its authors claim they use a different technique to measure the effects of sound, and require a lower volume compared to other approaches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Planned Obsolescence of Old Coders</title>

&lt;p name=&quot;ab7a&quot; id=&quot;ab7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-dropCapImage&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1H-Uc9Id0bT5_wktsycZiw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;501&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1H-Uc9Id0bT5_wktsycZiw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCapText&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; an alternative to the management track, Google, Microsoft, and other large companies define an “individual contributor (IC) track,” a ladder of job titles for senior engineers that rises in parallel to the management ladder. The IC track lets engineers climb a seniority ladder without forsaking the craft they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bb5&quot; id=&quot;7bb5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But the IC track is flawed. The programmers I spoke with said that promotion is slower on the IC track, and the distinctions between titles are blurry. According to David Golden, a 45-year-old engineer at MongoDB, “In the development-only track, there’s a bigger hurdle for me to move to the next level. It’s not clear how you get from one to the other and whether it’s something you can actually do anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8754&quot; id=&quot;8754&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Based on interviews with a half-dozen programmers, it is clear to me that companies should create a qualitatively different role for their most senior individual contributors. Candidates for such roles would be judged by their past effectiveness, the same as managers are, not by a fast-churning checklist of skills. Greater clarity would mean engineers could climb the ladder faster, and the prestige and renewed intellectual challenge of each level would keep programmers motivated into their fifties and sixties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d42&quot; id=&quot;9d42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Proven engineers who occupy the most senior roles should be deployed to solve the hardest problems on the most critical projects. Their roles should emphasize technical leadership through writing, speaking, and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c63f&quot; id=&quot;c63f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Because of their deep knowledge and broad experience, older programmers are able to translate their knowledge into ordinary terms, which puts them in a position to act as ambassadors to the nonprogramming world. Ari Blenkhorn filled this role when she led a cloth simulation project at the special effects studio Industrial Light and Magic. “Yoda’s robe, Harry Potter’s Quidditch cloak, the Dementors’ robes—all of that was the software that I helped develop,” she says. “I needed to speak the language of both the physics simulation research team and the animation team. They don’t think about partial differential equations. They think about cloth that’s silky and stretchy and ripples in the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Myequifax.com Bypasses Credit Freeze Pin</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/myequifax-com-bypasses-credit-freeze-pin/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/myequifax-com-bypasses-credit-freeze-pin/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Most people who have frozen their credit files with &lt;strong&gt;Equifax&lt;/strong&gt; have been issued a numeric Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is supposed to be required before a freeze can be lifted or thawed. Unfortunately, if you don’t already have an account at the credit bureau’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.equifax.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;myEquifax portal&lt;/a&gt;, it may be simple for identity thieves to lift an existing credit freeze at Equifax and bypass the PIN armed with little more than your, name, Social Security number and birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers in every U.S. state can now freeze their credit files for free with Equifax and two other major bureaus (&lt;strong&gt;Trans Union&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Experian&lt;/strong&gt;). A freeze makes it much harder for identity thieves to open new lines of credit in your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-46831&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/myequifax.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Equifax’s epic 2017 data breach impacting some 148 million Americans, many people did freeze their credit files at the big three in response. But Equifax has changed a few things since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to manage my own credit freeze at equifax.com as I’d done in years past, I was steered toward creating an account at myequifax.com, which I was shocked to find I did previously possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an account at myequifax.com was easy. In fact, it was too easy. The portal asked me for an email address and suggested a longish, randomized password, which I accepted. I chose an old email address that I knew wasn’t directly tied to my real-life identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next page asked me enter my SSN and date of birth, and to share a phone number (sharing was optional, so I didn’t). SSN and DOB data is widely available for sale in the cybercrime underground on almost all U.S. citizens. This has been the reality for years, and was so well before Equifax announced its big 2017 breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;myEquifax said it couldn’t verify that my email address belonged to the Brian Krebs at that SSN and DOB. It then asked a series of four security questions — so-called “knowledge-based authentication” or KBA questions designed to see if I can about my recent financial history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the data being asked about in these KBA quizzes is culled from public records, meaning that this information likely is publicly available in some form — either digitally or in-person. Indeed, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/data-broker-giants-hacked-by-id-theft-service/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;long assailed the KBA industry&lt;/a&gt; as creating a false sense of security that is easily bypassed by fraudsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential problem with relying on KBA questions to authenticate consumers online is that so much of the information needed to successfully guess the answers to those multiple-choice questions is now indexed or exposed by search engines, social networks and third-party services online — both criminal and commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three multiple-guess questions myEquifax asked were about loans or debts that I have never owed. Thus, the answer to the first three KBA questions asked was, “none of the above.” The final question asked for the name of our last mortgage company. Again, information that is not hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with my answers, Equifax informed me that yes indeed I was Brian Krebs and that I could now manage my existing freeze with the company. After requesting a thaw, I was brought to a vintage Equifax page that looked nothing like myEquifax’s sunnier new online plumage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_46832&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/equifax-PIN-needed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46832&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/equifax-PIN-needed.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;596&quot; height=&quot;496&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Equifax’s site says it will require users requesting changes to an existing credit freeze to have access to their freeze PIN and be ready to supply it. But Equifax never actually asks for the PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page informed me that if I previously secured a freeze of my credit file with Equifax and been given a PIN needed to undo that status in any way, that I should be ready to provide said information &lt;em&gt;if I was requesting changes via phone or email. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;credit freezes and thaws requested via myEquifax don’t require users to supply any pre-existing PIN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, I said. Let’s do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;myEquifax then asked for the date range requested to thaw my credit freeze. Submit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve successfully processed your security freeze request!,” the site declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also was exclaimed in an email to the random old address I’d used at myEquifax, although the site never once made any attempt to validate that I had access to this inbox, something that could be done by simply sending a confirmation link that needs to be clicked to activate the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I noticed Equifax added my old mobile number to my account, even though I never supplied this information and was not using this phone when I created the myEquifax account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_46833&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MYequifax-success.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46833&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MYequifax-success.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Successfully unfreezing (temporarily thawing) my credit freeze did not require me to ever supply my previously-issued freeze PIN from Equifax. Anyone who knew the vaguest and most knowable details about me could have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;myEquifax.com does not currently seek to verify the account by requesting confirmation via a phone call or text to the phone number associated with the account (also, recall that even providing a phone number was optional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, I did discover then when I used a different computer and Internet address to try to open up another account under my name, date of birth and SSN, it informed me that a profile already existed for this information. This suggests that signing up at myEquifax is probably a good idea, given that the alternative is more risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was way too easy to create my account, but I’m not saying everyone will be able to create one online. In testing with several readers over the past 24 hours, myEquifax seems to be returning a lot more error pages at the KBA stage of the process now, prompting people to try again later or make a request via email or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax spokesperson &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Bistritz-Balkan&lt;/strong&gt; said not requiring a PIN for people with existing freezes was by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With myEquifax, we created an online experience that enables consumers to securely and conveniently manage security freezes and fraud alerts,” Bistritz-Balkan said..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We deployed an experience that embraces both security standards (using a multi-factor and layered approach to verify the consumer’s identity) and reflects specific consumer feedback on managing security freezes and fraud alerts online without the use of a PIN,” she continued. “The account set-up process, which involves the creation of a username and password, relies on both user inputs and other factors to securely establish, verify, and authenticate that the consumer’s identity is connected to the consumer every time.”&lt;span id=&quot;more-46823&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Bistritz-Balkan what else besides a username and a password the company may have meant by “multi-factor;” I’m still waiting for clarification. But I did not experience anything like multi-factor in setting up or logging into my myEquifax account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may by closer to Equifax’s idea of multi-factor: The company told me that if I still really wanted to use my freeze PIN, I could always call their 800 number (800-349-9960) or make the request via mail. Nevermind that if I’m a bad guy looking to hack others, I’m definitely going to be using the myEquifax Web site — &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the options that make me have to supply a PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually the entire United States population in 2017 became eligible for free credit monitoring from Equifax following its 2017 breach. Credit monitoring can be useful for recovering from identity theft, but consumers should not expect these services to block new account fraud; the most they will likely do in this case is alert you after ID thieves have already opened new accounts in your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit freeze does not impact your ability to use any existing financial accounts you may have, including bank and credit/debit accounts. Nor will it protect you from fraud on those existing accounts. It is mainly a way to minimize the risk that someone may be able to create new accounts in your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t done so lately, it might a good time to order a free copy of your credit report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualcreditreport.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;annualcreditreport.com&lt;/a&gt;. This service entitles each consumer one free copy of their credit report annually from each of the three credit bureaus — either all at once or spread out over the year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People Who Eat the Same Meal Every Day</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vern Loomis, a retired structural draftsman in West Bloomfield, Michigan, had a standard office lunch: a peanut-butter sandwich, with various fruit, vegetable, and dessert accompaniments. He ate this, he estimates, nearly every workday for about 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His meal underwent slight modifications over time—jelly was added to the sandwich in the final five or so years—but its foundation remained the same. The meal was easy to prepare, cheap, and tasty. “And if you happen to be eating at your desk … it was something that was not too drippy,” he told me, so long as one applied the jelly a bit conservatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Loomis retired from his job but not his lunch, which he still eats three or four days a week (now with sliced bananas instead of jelly). “I never stopped liking it,” he says. “I still do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loomis may be uncommonly dedicated to his lunchtime ritual, but many share his proclivity for routine. One of the few existing surveys of people’s eating habits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that about 17 percent of British people had eaten the same lunch every day for two years; another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that a third of Brits ate the same lunch daily. But it’s hard to say for sure how common this really is, since these surveys tend to have been conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;by food purveyors&lt;/a&gt;, who might be inclined to exaggerate the ruts that diners are stuck in (and then try to sell them a way out). Still, loyalists who stick to a single meal for months or years—they are out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/pressure-cooker-home-cooked-meal/583876/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: The problems home cooking can’t solve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are public figures whose monotonous diets have been revealed in interviews—they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/coach-nick-saban-alabama-maniac&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;college-football coaches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/crunch-fitness-franchise-ceo-day-in-the-life-2018-8#the-ceo-has-a-few-strategies-for-managing-his-team-12&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;fitness-chain CEOs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/17/ricky-wilson-the-voice-same-lunch-every-day&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;TV personalities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.self.com/story/victoria-beckham-salmon-skin&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;fashion designers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-11/books/bk-6151_1_ludwig-wittgenstein/2&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;dead philosophers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andersoncooper/status/175588845209927681&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the context, eating the same thing every day can come off as a moderately charming quirk, an indictment of one’s lack of creativity, or a signal of professional focus and drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the symbolism, these people’s behavior is not doing them harm. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University and the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=marion+nestle&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;several books about nutrition and the food industry&lt;/a&gt;, says the consequences of eating the same lunch every day depend on the contents of that lunch and of the day’s other meals. “If your daily lunch contains a variety of healthful foods,” she says, “relax and enjoy it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is nothing wrong with this habit. In fact, there are many things right with it. I spoke with about half a dozen people who, at one time or another, have eaten the same thing for lunch every day. Together, their stories form a defense of a practice that is often written off as uninspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the people I talked with emphasized the stress-reducing benefits of eating the same thing each day. Amanda Respers, a 32-year-old software developer in Newport News, Virginia, once ate a variation on the same home-brought salad (a lettuce, a protein, and a dressing) at work for about a year. She liked the simplicity of the formula, but the streak ended when she and her now-husband, who has more of an appetite for variety, moved in together six years ago. Would she still be eating the salad every day if she hadn’t met him? “Oh heck yeah,” she told me. “It would’ve saved so much time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharilyn Neidhardt, a photo editor in New York City, once found solace in regularity. About a decade ago, she switched jobs, and her new one stressed her out. “There were phones ringing constantly and there were people yelling all the time,” she recalls. One thing that Neidhardt found soothed her and gave her a measure of control over her day: She picked up a spicy noodle dish called &lt;em&gt;tantanmen&lt;/em&gt; from the same ramen restaurant every lunch break. She did this for “a minimum of six months,” after which she got tired of the meal (and its cost) and, perhaps more important, settled into the new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating the same thing over and over can also simplify the decisions people make about what they put into their bodies. Currie Lee, a 28-year-old resident of Los Angeles who works in retail, has some food allergies, and keeping her lunch unchanged “makes it easy” to eat around them. For about six months, at her previous job, she brought overnight oats every day; her current go-to is a turkey sandwich with hummus, avocado, arugula, and cheese, on gluten-free bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee’s eating habits are not just a function of her allergies, though. She likes that eating the same thing makes grocery shopping simpler, brings consistency to her sometimes chaotic schedule, and made it less likely she’d spend the money at the “$12-salad place” near her previous office. Besides, she really likes the things she brings. “I’m not eating, like, a PB&amp;amp;J every day,” she says. “I try to make it taste good and interesting.” (I did not tell Vern Loomis what Lee apparently thinks of his lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chloe Cota, a computer engineer in New York City, does not have as strict a lunchtime regimen as others described in this story, but she has noticed that when her company brings in catered lunch, she always picks a salad when it’s available. She came to think of this default selection as reducing her “cognitive overhead”—a way of not expending mental energy on something that wasn’t a high priority for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lunch variety doesn't really matter to me,” she says. “I would be perfectly happy to eat the same Caesar salad or peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich every day.” Similarly, she has devised a standard “work uniform” (one of her many pairs of black leggings, plus a T-shirt), which helps streamline her morning routine. She says she took inspiration from tech moguls such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, who essentially automated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-mark-zuckerberg-wear-the-same-outfit-2015-4&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;their own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120216060910/https:/gawker.com/5848754&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;daily attire decisions&lt;/a&gt; in the name of reducing cognitive overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salad station, Cota says, is also an opportunity for her to practice “mindful eating,” something she started doing as part of her recovery from an eating disorder she developed in high school. She says it helps to know that the foods available to her in that moment are ones she knows she likes, which “short-circuits that whole negative space in my brain where I might get back into those disordered behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, the repetition in their daily food preparation is in the meals they make for other people. Ambreia Meadows-Fernandez, a 26-year-old writer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, cooks the same meal—“a meat and rice,” sometimes with some vegetables—for her 3-year-old son most nights of the week. “It made it simple in a way that there was less stress about what to give him,” she says. He usually gets a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich for lunch, and doesn’t seem to mind the lack of variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most people around the world who eat the same thing every day aren’t doing so voluntarily. “I would say most people most of the time have little choice in their staple,” says Paul Freedman, a historian at Yale and the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780871406804&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Restaurants That Changed America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If they live in a rice culture, they will have rice for every meal; ditto potatoes.” The cooking fat used—say, butter or ghee—generally remains the same as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variety, Freedman says, usually comes from “relishes,” the food-anthropology term for flavor-adding ingredients such as spices, vegetables, and modest amounts of meat (like bacon). “This staple + fat + relish combination is what dominated eating in traditional peasant cultures,” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Krishnendu Ray, a food-studies scholar at NYU, about dietary variety, he said: “Newness or difference from the norm is a very urban, almost postmodern, quest. It is recent. It is class-based.” So, when accounting for the totality of human experience, it is the variety-seekers—not the same-lunchers—who are the unusual ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should reveal that my interest in this subject is not purely philosophical. Nearly every workday for the past five or so years, sometime during the 1 o’clock hour, I have assembled a more or less identical plate of food: Bean-and-cheese soft tacos (topped with greens, salt, pepper, and hot sauce), with baby carrots, tempeh, and some fruit on the side. And almost invariably, I see the same colleague in our communal kitchen, who asks with delight, “Joe, what are you having for lunch today?” The types of bean and cheese rotate, as does the fruit—which depends on the season—but I do not inform my co-worker of these variations when I laugh off her very clever and funny question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people I talked with recounted similar experiences of having co-workers harmlessly joke about their meals, like “How was that sandwich today, Vern? Did you use crunchy or plain?” Currie Lee’s former colleagues, aware that she adored horses, found her regular meal particularly amusing, saying things like “Oh, there’s Currie with her oats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee thought these comments were just regular workplace small talk. But perhaps there is more to them, and eating the same thing each day reveals something deeper about who people are, or at least perceived to be. Amanda Respers, the yearlong eater of salads, says that “we bring a little bit of home when we eat lunch at work,” and naturally people’s outside-of-work identities are a subject of interest. What does eating the same thing each day say, then? “No offense, but it gives the impression that you’re a little bit boring,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think Respers is on to something, though I’d draw a slightly different conclusion. The daily rituals of office life are characterized by their monotony and roteness, and bringing a different lunch each day is a sunny, inspired attempt to combat all the repetition. I do genuinely appreciate the optimism of those attempts. But in my mind, eating the same thing for lunch each day represents a sober reckoning with the fundamental sameness of office life. It seems like an honest admission that life will have some drudgery in it—so accept that and find joy elsewhere instead of forcing a little bit of novelty into a Tupperware and dragging it along on your commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am probably overthinking this. Ultimately, I am partial to Vern Loomis’s analysis of what prompted his co-workers to poke fun at his peanut-butter sandwich: “Maybe [they did so] just out of good humor, or maybe guilt that they’re not eating as healthy—that they’re eating a greasy burger or something—or going out and spending $15 for a lunch when mine only cost 80 cents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jealousy,” he concluded. “I think it’s jealousy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is bidding to be the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-policy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary&lt;/a&gt;, championed another expansive idea on Friday evening in front of a crowd of thousands in Queens: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America’s largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At a rally in Long Island City, the neighborhood that was to be home to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a major new Amazon campus&lt;/a&gt;, Ms. Warren laid out her proposal calling for regulators who would undo some tech mergers, as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have these giants corporations — do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? — that think they can roll over everyone,” Ms. Warren told the crowd, drawing applause. She compared Amazon to the dystopian novel “The Hunger Games,” in which those with power force their wishes on the less fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m sick of freeloading billionaires,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Warren’s policy announcement sent reverberations from New York to Silicon Valley, as she further cemented herself as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes to the country’s structure in the name of equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among the crowded field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, Ms. Warren has done the most to add detail to those early proposals, including a plan for universal child care, a tax on the country’s wealthiest families, and, as of Friday, breaking up big technological giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Warren’s regulatory plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, the campaign said, including Facebook’s deals for &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-buy-messaging-start-up/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/business/dealbook/amazon-whole-foods.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon’s addition of Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;, and Google’s purchase of Waze. Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users’ data with third parties. Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics, would be split apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;[&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&amp;amp;module=Intentional&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Pressure for elected officials to place additional oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months, particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;violated customer privacy agreements&lt;/a&gt;. Ms. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Ms. Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon — though Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Senator Kamala Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/zuckerberg-facebook-senate-hearing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;pressed executives on consumer privacy&lt;/a&gt; but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/cory-bookers-silicon-valley-friendships-started-at-stanford/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;more willing to embrace the controversial corporations&lt;/a&gt;, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Our technology industry is the envy of the world and we need policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice — but we also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,” said Ro Khanna, the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said that blanket statements against big tech companies weren’t helpful, but that each company needed to be “evaluated on a case-by-case basis and afforded due process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;[&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Warren’s plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to “structurally separate” their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have been a “good opportunity” for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act — in the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of Mark Zuckerberg — “more like a government than a traditional company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During a brief interview later in New York, Ms. Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was right to have offered &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/nyregion/amazon-cuomo-gianaris.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;hefty tax incentives&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston’s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, from Ms. Warren’s home state, also offered similar incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“That’s not the point,” she said. “Before you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, ‘What will you offer me if I came?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is a refrain she has hit for years, including in a 2016 speech titled “Reigniting Competition in the American Economy.” Last year, she introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which seeks to curb shareholder power by forcing corporations to increase worker representation on their governing boards, while also reducing incentives for big companies to pay out shareholders rather than reinvest in businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget Committee, said Ms. Warren’s plan was “practical” and “necessary.” He compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America’s past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There’s been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C. that these companies are progressive,” Mr. Stoller said. “Their employees give to Democrats, they’re friendly to social liberalism, there’s an idealism to how they talk about the world. That’s been the traditional sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“But these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,” he added. “They don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Carl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade association called NetChoice, said he felt Ms. Warren’s plan was unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Politicizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,” said Mr. Szabo, who is a professor of privacy law at George Mason University’s law school. “We’ve already seen how politics can inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don’t think our legislators should be encouraging this precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though tech giants have experienced several controversies in recent years, it is unclear how popular Ms. Warren’s antitrust proposal would be with voters. Rob Atkinson, president of Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry-sponsored group, defended the power of big companies in the technology sector for what he described as benefits to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The Warren campaign’s call to break up big tech companies reflects a ‘big is bad, small is beautiful’ ideology run amok,” Mr. Atkinson said. “The proposal ignores the fact that many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Matt McIlwain, a partner at the Seattle venture capital firm Madrona Venture Group, which was an early Amazon investor, said in an email, “Senator Warren and others with a similar mind-set are misguided on the need to break up larger tech companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Companies in the innovation economy have a strong track record of creating quality products and services that are often free or at dramatically lower costs than previous services,” Mr. McIlwain said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For those closely watching the Democratic presidential nomination contest, the announcement was another example of Ms. Warren’s political strategy, which is to appeal to voters based on policy ideas and retail politics, not soaring oration or feel-good messages of unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among the crowd in Queens, which included more young people than many Warren rallies across the country, several said they appreciated her policy focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The fact that she focuses on concrete policy, this early in the race, is really aspirational,” said Milo Vassallo, who is involved in several Brooklyn leftist groups. Mr. Vassallo said he particularly liked Ms. Warren’s new proposal on technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Her goal is not to undermine big tech, but just make it more competitive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kevin Murray, a 28-year-old law student who lives in Queens and who has not decided on a candidate to support, praised Ms. Warren’s proposals as “tangible.” Mr. Murray also wanted to come to the rally because Ms. Warren is the author of one of his law school textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I would’ve brought it for her to sign,” he said, “but it was a rental.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How random can you be?</title>
<link>https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mar 07, 2019       tags: &lt;em&gt;| &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/tags/js.html&quot;&gt;js&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/tags/visualisation.html&quot;&gt;visualisation&lt;/a&gt; |&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-random-can-you-be&quot;&gt;How random can you be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s play a game. You press ← and → as randomly as you can, and I will try to guess your next input. Use your keyboard or the buttons below (on touchscreen devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I guess right, I will take $1 from your virtual account. Every time I guess wrong, you’ll get $1.05. If you are as random as you think, you’ll be making virtual dough in no time. Don’t worry, there is no cheating involved. I simply keep track of the patterns you produce and use them to predict your next move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve become tired of watching your virtual money evaporate, press the “randomize” button below, and I will add 10 pseudo-random inputs on your behalf. &lt;strong&gt;On average&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. not all the time), this is going to earn you some money. Isn’t it ironic that a pseudo-random number generator is more “random” than you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I’ve added five custom events for google analytics to collect statistics on correct guesses after 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1000 inputs. If you’d rather not be counted, please load the html file from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ex-punctis/not-so-random&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;randomize&quot; onclick=&quot;randomHelpFunc(event)&quot;&gt;randomize!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;left&quot; ontouchstart=&quot;captureBtnLeftFunc(event)&quot;&gt;  ←  &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;right&quot; ontouchstart=&quot;captureBtnRightFunc(event)&quot;&gt;  →  &lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centreContainer&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;log&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start pressing ← and → on your keyboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(←/→ buttons above on touchscreen devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log messages will appear here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work exactly? Your fingers tend to repeat certain patterns even if you don’t notice it. The program keeps a database of each possible combination of 5 presses, and two counters are stored under each entry — one is for every zero that follows the combination, and the other one is for all the ones that follow this combination. So every time you press a key, an entry in the database gets updated. To make a prediction, the program needs only to look up the entry corresponding to the last 5 presses and decide by looking at the counters which key press is more likely to follow. The rest is up to Fortuna (velut luna). I’ve run this script with 200 pseudo-random inputs 100,000 times, and found that the distribution of correct guesses is approximately normal with µ=50% and σ=3.5% (this agrees with the binomial estimation, of course). The probability of the program guessing your inputs &amp;gt;57% (µ+2σ) of the time purely by chance is very slim, which suggests that you really aren’t good at making random choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits:&lt;/strong&gt; I got the idea from PBS Digital Studios Infinite Series on YouTube (a highly recommended channel!). One of the videos linked &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/&quot;&gt;this demo&lt;/a&gt; which inspired me to experiment with the idea. I didn’t dig deeply, but it seems my implementation (5-grams) ended up the same (or at least very similar). I’ve also tried 3-grams, 4-grams, and adaptive n-grams (n&amp;lt;6), but it seemed they did no better than the current 5-gram model. Although, to be honest, I didn’t have the time to do thorough testing, so I may be wrong. The plot is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/javascript/&quot;&gt;plotly.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How random can you be?</og:title>
<og:description>Suppose I asked you to generate a random sequence of ones and zeroes. Every time you add another 1 or 0 to the sequence, I am going to predict your next choice. Do you think you can make your sequence random enough that I fail to guess more than ~50% correct? Read this post to find out. Spoiler — you are not so random.</og:description>
