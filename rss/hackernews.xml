<title>Facebook announces policy changes ahead of 2020 elections</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112048980882521</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago, I committed to reviewing our policies ahead of the 2020 elections. That work is ongoing, but today I want to share some new policies to connect people with authoritative information about voting, crack down on voter suppression, and fight hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2020 elections were already shaping up to be heated -- and that was before we all faced the additional complexities of voting during a pandemic and protests for racial justice across the country. During this moment, Facebook will take extra precautions to help everyone stay safe, stay informed, and ultimately use their voice where it matters most -- voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the changes we're announcing today come directly from feedback from the civil rights community and reflect months of work with our civil rights auditors, led by noted civil rights and liberties expert Laura W. Murphy and Megan Cacace, a partner at the respected civil rights law firm of Relman &amp;amp; Colfax. Facebook stands for giving people a voice -- especially people who have previously not had as much voice or power to share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Providing Authoritative Information on Voting During the Pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we announced the largest voting information campaign in American history, with the goal of helping 4 million people register to vote. As part of this, we're creating a Voting Information Center to share authoritative information on how and when you can vote, including voter registration, voting by mail and early voting. During a pandemic when people may be afraid of going to polls, sharing authoritative information on voting by mail will be especially important. We'll be showing the Voting Information Center at the top of the Facebook and Instagram apps over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of Covid, we're also focused on preventing new forms of potential voter suppression. For example, if someone says on Election Day that a city has been identified as a Covid hotspot, is that voter suppression or simply sharing health information? Because of the difficulty of judging this at scale, we are adopting a policy of attaching a link to our Voting Information Center for posts that discuss voting, including from politicians. This isn't a judgment of whether the posts themselves are accurate, but we want people to have access to authoritative information either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Additional Steps to Fight Voter Suppression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, we updated our policies to ban any content that misleads people on when or how they can vote. We're now tightening these policies to reflect the realities of the 2020 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the most dangerous voter suppression campaigns can be local and run in the days immediately before an election, we're going to use our Elections Operations Center to quickly respond and remove false claims about polling conditions in the 72 hours leading into election day. Learning from our experience fighting Covid misinformation, we will partner with and rely on state election authorities to help determine the accuracy of information and what is potentially dangerous. We know this will be challenging in practice as facts on the ground may be uncertain and we don't want to remove accurate information about challenges people are experiencing, but we're building our operation to be able to respond quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also ban posts that make false claims saying ICE agents are checking for immigration papers at polling places, which is a tactic used to discourage voting. We'll also remove any threats of coordinated interference, like someone saying &quot;My friends and I will be doing our own monitoring of the polls to make sure only the right people vote&quot;, which can be used to intimidate voters. We will continue to review our voter suppression policies on an ongoing basis as part of our work on voter engagement and racial justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Creating a Higher Standard for Hateful Content in Ads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's study from the EU showed that Facebook acts faster and removes a greater percent of hate speech on our services than other major internet platforms, including YouTube and Twitter. We've invested heavily in both AI systems and human review teams so that now we identify almost 90% of the hate speech we remove before anyone even reports it to us. We've also set the standard in our industry by publishing regular transparency reports so people can hold us accountable for progress. We will continue investing in this work and will commit whatever resources are necessary to improve our enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe there is a public interest in allowing a wider range of free expression in people's posts than in paid ads. We already restrict certain types of content in ads that we allow in regular posts, but we want to do more to prohibit the kind of divisive and inflammatory language that has been used to sow discord. So today we're prohibiting a wider category of hateful content in ads. Specifically, we're expanding our ads policy to prohibit claims that people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or survival of others. We're also expanding our policies to better protect immigrants, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads suggesting these groups are inferior or expressing contempt, dismissal or disgust directed at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Labeling Newsworthy Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of times a year, we leave up content that would otherwise violate our policies if the public interest value outweighs the risk of harm. Often, seeing speech from politicians is in the public interest, and in the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says, we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon start labeling some of the content we leave up because it is deemed newsworthy, so people can know when this is the case. We'll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what's acceptable in our society -- but we'll add a prompt to tell people that the content they're sharing may violate our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify one point: there is no newsworthiness exemption to content that incites violence or suppresses voting. Even if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down. Similarly, there are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I'm announcing here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the policies we're implementing today are designed to address the reality of the challenges our country is facing and how they're showing up across our community. I'm committed to making sure Facebook remains a place where people can use their voice to discuss important issues, because I believe we can make more progress when we hear each other. But I also stand against hate, or anything that incites violence or suppresses voting, and we're committed to removing that no matter where it comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're continuing to review our policies, and we'll keep working with outside experts and civil rights organizations to adjust our approach as new risks emerge. I'm optimistic that we can make progress on public health and racial justice while maintaining our democratic traditions around free expression and voting. I'm committed to making sure Facebook is a force for good on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Santa Cruz, California bans predictive policing in U.S. first</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-tech-trfn/california-city-bans-predictive-policing-in-u-s-first-idUSKBN23V2XC</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-tech-trfn/california-city-bans-predictive-policing-in-u-s-first-idUSKBN23V2XC</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As officials mull steps to tackle police brutality and racism, California’s Santa Cruz has become the first U.S. city to ban predictive policing, which digital rights experts said could spark similar moves across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how predictive policing and facial recognition can be disportionately biased against people of color, we officially banned the use of these technologies in the city of Santa Cruz,” Mayor Justin Cummings said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration will work with the police to “help eliminate racism in policing”, the seaside city’s first male African-American mayor said on his Facebook page, following a vote on Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used by police across the United States for almost a decade, predictive policing relies on algorithms to interpret police records, analyzing arrest or parole data to send officers to target chronic offenders, or identifying places where crime may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But critics says it reinforces racist patterns of policing - low-income, ethnic minority neighbourhoods have historically been overpoliced so the data shows them as crime hotspots, leading to the deployment of more police to those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As Santa Cruz rightly recognized, predictive policing and facial recognition are dangerous, racially biased technologies that should never be used by our government,” said Matt Cagle, a lawyer with the ACLU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PredPol Inc, the Santa Cruz-headquartered firm that pioneered the technology, said that it supported the city resolution’s requirement that predictive policing “will not perpetuate bias”, among other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the institutionalized state of racial inequality in America, this is a legitimate filter to be applied to any new technology acquired by a public entity, whether used for public safety or not,” it said on Twitter on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston’s city council on Wednesday voted to ban face surveillance technology, a move also welcomed by digital rights activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lawmakers across the country have a responsibility to step up and dismantle surveillance systems that have long been used to repress activism, target communities of color, and invade people’s private lives,” Cagle said in emailed comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roya Pakzad, a Santa Cruz-based researcher who founded human rights group Taraaz, said campaigners would continue to push for more limits on police use of technology, including requiring them to seek community approval of any new surveillance tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is still missed in this ordinance is a requirement for public transparency and oversight,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Carving out a niche as a small artist on Spotify</title>
<link>https://www.stevebenjamins.com/blog/music-in-the-age-of-algorithms-47syg</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.stevebenjamins.com/blog/music-in-the-age-of-algorithms-47syg</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you get on editorial playlists? I sincerely have no clue. I've been on editorial playlists 16 times but I have no idea how to replicate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In my experience, major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists. This is discouraging— if major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists, they’ll also get better placement in algorithmic playlists… But major label artists also only typically get 13% - 20% of streaming royalties… so there are still plenty of reasons to stay indie!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Algorithms Make For Looser Relationships Between Artists And Listeners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity.&quot; - David Bowie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;My most popular song 'Circles' has been played 1,350,00 times. And every month about 65,000 people listen to my music on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Guess how many people follow me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/stevebenjamins/&quot;&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;? 480.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just because people listen to me on Spotify, doesn’t mean they want a deep relationship. Most listeners just add 'Circles' to their library and move on with their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m definitely okay with this. I’d rather listeners follow me on Spotify rather than Instagram anyways. Plus only good things can come out of de-coupling fame from music. Make music because it’s what you love to do— not because you want to get famous. If you want to get famous I think you’re better off as a Youtuber or Tiktok influencer anyways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is just the nature of algorithmic playlists— they lead to a high volume of listeners with a very loose connection to you as an artist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Earning $800 / Month With Spotify — Steve Benjamins</og:title>
<og:url>https://www.stevebenjamins.com/blog/music-in-the-age-of-algorithms-47syg</og:url>
<og:type>article</og:type>
<og:description>I'm making over $800 per month with my music— almost exclusively through Spotify. This is up from $400 per month last year. I don't tour, I don't sell merch and I'm not on a major label. I'm just a small indie artist making music in my evenings— and Spotify is making that possible.</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;On the weekend of May 29, thousands of people marched, sang, grieved, and chanted, demanding an end to police brutality and the defunding of police departments in the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. They &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/2020protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;marched en masse&lt;/a&gt; in cities like Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, empowered by their number and the assumed anonymity of the crowd. And they did so completely unaware that a tech company was using location data harvested from their cellphones to predict their race, age, and gender and where they lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over two weeks later, that company, Mobilewalla, released a report titled &quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/4309344/MW%20Protester%20Demographic%20Analysis.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George Floyd Protester Demographics: Insights Across 4 Major US Cities&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; In 60 pie charts, the document details what percentage of protesters the company believes were male or female, young adult (18–34); middle-aged 35º54, or older (55+); and &quot;African-American,&quot; &quot;Caucasian/Others,&quot; &quot;Hispanic,&quot; or “Asian-American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;African American males made up the majority of protesters in the four observed cities vs. females,” &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mobilewalla.com/about/press/new-report-reveals-demographics-of-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mobilewalla claimed&lt;/a&gt;. “Men vs. women in Atlanta (61% vs. 39%), in Los Angeles (65% vs. 35%), in Minneapolis (54% vs. 46%) and in New York (59% vs. 41%).&quot; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/4309344/Mobilewalla%20Protester%20Insights%20Methodology.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The company analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from 16,902 devices at protests — including &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; 8,152 devices in New York, 4,527 in Los Angeles, 2,357 in Minneapolis, and 1,866 in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren told BuzzFeed News that Mobilewalla’s report was alarming, and an example of the consequences of the lack of regulation on data brokers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This report shows that an enormous number of Americans – probably without even knowing it – are handing over their full location history to shady location data brokers with zero restrictions on what companies can do with it,” Warren said. “In an end-run around the Constitution's limits on government surveillance, these companies can even sell this data to the government, which can use it for law and immigration enforcement. That's why I've opened an investigation into the government contracts held by location data brokers, and I’ll keep pushing for answers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how accurate Mobilewalla’s analysis actually is.

There are no federal laws in place to prevent this information from being abused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobilewalla CEO Anindya Datta told BuzzFeed News that the data analysis that made the George Floyd Protester Demographics possible wasn’t a new kind of project. “The underlying data, the underlying observations that came into the report, is something that we collect and produce on a regular basis,” he said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datta said Mobilewalla didn’t prepare the report for law enforcement or a public agency, but rather to satisfy its own employees' curiosity about what its vast trove of unregulated data could reveal about the demonstrators. Datta told BuzzFeed News that the company doesn’t plan to include information about whether a person attended a protest to its clients, or to law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to tell you a specific reason as to why we did this,” Datta said. “But over time, a bunch of us in the company were watching with curiosity and some degree of alarm as to what’s going on.” He defined those sources of alarm as what he called &quot;antisocial behavior,&quot; including vandalism, looting, and actions like &quot;breaking the glass of an Apple store.” He added that they were attempting to test if protests were being driven by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873592665/unmasking-the-outside-agitator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outside agitators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datta said that he and a few Mobilewalla employees chose locations where they expected protests would occur — including the George Floyd memorial site in Minneapolis, and Gracie Mansion in New York — and analyzed data from mobile devices in those areas collected between May 29 and May 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacinta González, a senior campaign organizer at Latinx advocacy group Mijente, told BuzzFeed News that by monitoring protesters, Mobilewalla could undermine freedom of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really just fundamentally terrifying to understand the way that companies can access such vast amounts of data to process for their own gain — without folks understanding even that they have consented to their information being taken, much less used in this way,” González said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to understand that once technology hits the market, it's actually very hard to limit who has access to it — whether it is police, or whether it is other actors that want to harm communities,” González added. “Once this stuff is out there, we just have no way of understanding how it’s being used. Often we don’t even know that it’s out there to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobilewalla does not collect the data itself, but rather buys it from a variety of sources, including &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mobilewalla.com/business-services-privacy-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertisers, data brokers, and internet service providers&lt;/a&gt;. Once it has it, the company uses artificial intelligence to turn a stew of location data, device IDs, and browser histories to predict a person's demographics — including race, age, gender, zip code, or personal interests. Mobilewalla sells aggregated versions of that stuff back to advertisers. On its website, Mobilewalla says that it works with companies across a variety of industries — like retail, dining, telecom, banking, consulting, health, and on-demand services (like ride-hailing).&lt;/p&gt;

      &quot;Who would know that they’d be using it to track demographics of people at protests?&quot;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;77.087802562886&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how accurate this report actually is. Datta told BuzzFeed News that his company, on average, has access to location data for 30% to 60% of people in any given location in the United States. Mobilewalla &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5k8FBf6_8s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; that it collects an average of 25 billion “signals” (or pieces of information, like GPS coordinates) every day. Every week, these signals pour in from an average of 1.6 billion devices. Datta said that about 300 million of these devices are in the US. (This doesn’t mean that Mobilewalla collected data on 300 million people, because one person might have more than one device that Mobilewalla is tracking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saira Hussain, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told BuzzFeed News that Mobilewalla’s report was not surprising, but very troubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If [this data] ends up in hands of the government, or if protesters are concerned that it could end up in the hands of the government, that may suppress speech, it may deter people from going to protests,” Hussain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mobilewalla.com/business-services-privacy-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mobilewalla's privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; says that people have the right to opt out of certain uses of their personal information. But it also says, &quot;Even if you opt out, we, our Clients and third parties may still collect and use information regarding your activities on the Services, Properties, websites and/or applications and/or information from advertisements for other legal purposes as described herein.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no federal law that regulates how companies like Mobilewalla — which buy and sell people’s data on the internet — can use people’s information. Hussain noted that information about data-sharing can be buried in the Terms of Service, there isn’t meaningful consent built into most privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given how many different industries that this company works within for targeted advertising, it seems that you probably wouldn’t know, once the information in the company’s hands, exactly what they’re gonna be using it for,” Hussain said. “And who would know that they’d be using it to track demographics of people at protests?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Microsoft to permanently close its retail stores</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;0vSK3u&quot;&gt;Microsoft is giving up on physical retail. Today &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/2020/06/26/microsoft-store-announces-new-approach-to-retail/&quot;&gt;the company announced plans to permanently close all Microsoft Store locations&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and around the world, except for four locations that will be “reimagined” as experience centers that no longer sell products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M0dA53&quot;&gt;Those locations are New York City (Fifth Ave), London (Oxford Circus), Sydney (Westfield Sydney), and the Redmond campus location. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20687952/microsoft-store-london-oxford-circus-uk-preview-review&quot;&gt;The London store only just opened&lt;/a&gt; about a year ago. All other Microsoft Store locations across the United States and globally will be closing, and the company will concentrate on digital retail moving forward. Microsoft says Microsoft.com and the Xbox and Windows storefronts reach “up to 1.2 billion monthly customers in 190 markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7lrpXg&quot;&gt;The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that no layoffs will result from today’s decision. “Our commitment to growing and developing careers from this diverse talent pool is stronger than ever,” Microsoft Store VP David Porter &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fnew-day-microsoft-store-david-porter%2F%3FtrackingId%3DYOPhK8P9TBWXObsaycr0rA%253D%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F26%2F21297400%2Fmicrosoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; on the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZuNGVY&quot;&gt;A source with knowledge of Microsoft’s retail operations told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this plan was originally in place for next year, but was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Microsoft’s Xbox Series X is launching this holiday, so it makes sense that the company had at least initially planned for the stores to make it that far. The dual-screen Surface Neo device that was also going to ship during the holidays &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214637/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-release-date-delay&quot;&gt;has been delayed&lt;/a&gt;, though the Surface Duo is apparently still on track for this year. Still, if you were hoping your local Microsoft Store would be a surefire bet for a new Xbox, you’ll have to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BST03s&quot;&gt;The big decision partially explains why Microsoft had yet to reopen a single store after they were all closed in light of the pandemic. Last week, Microsoft told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its “approach for re-opening Microsoft Store locations is measured and cautious, guided by monitoring global data, listening to public health and safety experts, and tracking local government restrictions.” At the time, the company declined to offer an update on when any stores might open again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;Zc3RSM&quot;&gt;Since many Microsoft stores are in shopping centers and malls, the continued closure hasn’t stood out as unusual. In US states that are taking a cautious approach to restoring retail operations — to avoid a resurgence of the novel coronavirus — most malls remain closed. There have already been spikes of COVID-19 cases in regions with more relaxed guidelines, which has led Apple to re-close some stores where it had only recently welcomed customers back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qUw1dd&quot;&gt;In April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/features/emergency-plan-microsoft-store-employees-helping-new-ways-despite-closed-doors/&quot;&gt;Microsoft outlined in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; how many retail store associates had shifted to remote work after their everyday jobs were sidelined. The company has continued to provide regular pay for team members through the pandemic. “Our retail team members will continue to serve customers working from Microsoft corporate facilities or remotely and we will continue to develop our diverse team in support of the overall company mission and objectives,” the company said in today’s update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Op4570&quot;&gt;The Microsoft Store debuted in 2009 and closely adhered to Apple’s successful retail playbook. Each store is a showcase for the company’s Surface and Xbox hardware, plus a selection of third-party PCs. Employees were well-versed in all things Windows, and the company also offered in-store events, workshops, customer service, and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U8OwMa&quot;&gt;The stores were were closed even before Microsoft’s latest hardware release cycle that included the Surface Book 3, Surface Go 2, Surface Earbuds, and Surface Headphones 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q7bG8J&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 26th 9:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The article has been updated to clarify that all Microsoft retail stores will be closing. The company’s locations in New York, London, Sydney, and Redmond will be converted into experience centers that do not sell products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft removes manual deferrals from Windows Update &amp;#039;to prevent confusion&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-removes-manual-deferrals-from-windows-update-by-it-pros-to-prevent-confusion/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-removes-manual-deferrals-from-windows-update-by-it-pros-to-prevent-confusion/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is removing the ability for business users to defer manually &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/topic/windows-10/&quot; data-omniture-track=&quot;moduleClick&quot; data-omniture-track-data=&quot;{&amp;quot;moduleInfo&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;link_anchor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pageType&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feature updates using Windows Update settings starting with the Windows 10 2004/May Update. Microsoft seemingly made this change public with a change in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-2004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Windows 10 2004 for IT Pros documentation on June 23&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;relatedContent alignRight&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;int&quot;&gt;Windows 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft officials say this change is happening in the name of reducing confusion. Here's the explanation from the Microsoft page (which I saw thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowstimes.com/windows-10-version-2004-removes-advanced-update-deferral-options/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;WindowsTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;), and which I had heard about from a reader last week. (Last week, I assumed this was a bug, but now it seems like it's actually a &quot;feature.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Last year, we changed update installation policies for Windows 10 to only target devices running a feature update version that is nearing the end of service. As a result, many devices are only updating once a year. To enable all devices to make the most of this policy change, and to prevent confusion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-2004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;we have removed deferrals from the Windows Update settings Advanced Options page starting on Windows 10, version 2004&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the release of the May 2020/2004 update, Pro, Education and Enterprise users could manually defer updates for 365 days using the Windows Update settings Advanced Options page. (For more, see this post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/faq-how-to-manage-windows-10-updates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how to manage Windows 10 feature updates&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, for users who want to retain the ability to defer feature updates manually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-2004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Microsoft offers this guidance&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you wish to continue leveraging deferrals, you can use local Group Policy (Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates &amp;gt; Windows Components &amp;gt; Windows Update &amp;gt; Windows Update for Business &amp;gt; Select when Preview builds and Feature Updates are received or Select when Quality Updates are received).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been continually tweaking the way the Windows 10 updating process works based on &quot;user feedback,&quot; which seems to be, in large part, complaints. Microsoft makes available two Windows 10 feature updates per year. Business users have had the right to defer those updates for up to 365 days unless their devices are running a Windows 10 feature update that is nearing the end of support. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-making-big-windows-10-update-changes-starting-with-the-may-2019-release/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows 10 Home users last year got the right to pause feature updates for up to 35 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of Enterprise and Education users only care about the Windows 10 feature update released in the fall because they get 30  months of support (as opposed to 18 months of support for the spring feature update). Consequently, some of those users only update their Windows 10 devices every other year using the fall update. (See my ZDNet colleague Ed Bott's post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-you-get-the-next-version-of-windows-10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a full run-down of how Windows 10 feature updates work&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-windows-10-may-2020-update-is-starting-to-roll-out-to-mainstream-users/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft began rolling out the May 2020/2004 update on May 27&lt;/a&gt;. I asked Microsoft if the company had anything to say as to why users weren't notified in advance about this change but received no word back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the US military usually punishes misconduct but police often close ranks</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-military-usually-punishes-misconduct-but-police-often-close-ranks-127898</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many U.S. military members publicly disavowed President Trump’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/15/trump-pardon-war-crimes-071244&quot;&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt; Edward Gallagher, the former SEAL commando convicted of killing a teenage detainee in Iraq in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallagher’s alleged war crimes were nearly universally condemned up the chain of command, from enlisted men to &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanmilitarynews.com/2019/11/heres-richard-spencers-full-letter-to-trump-resigning-as-navy-secretary/&quot;&gt;Navy Secretary Richard Spencer&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, it was Gallagher’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2019/11/27/timeline-gallahers-war-crimes-trump-intervention/4305986002/&quot;&gt;SEAL colleagues&lt;/a&gt; who reported the former commando’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insistence on holding fellow service members accountable for bad behavior sharply differentiates the military from the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When police are revealed to have killed an unarmed suspect or used excessive force during arrest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2016&amp;amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory&quot;&gt;police generally defend those actions&lt;/a&gt;. Cops who report wrongdoing are routinely ostracized as “rats” and denied promotions, according to a 1998 Human Rights Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo93.htm&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers identify this so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/01/31/blue-wall-of-silence-policing-the-usa-cops-community/2604929002/&quot;&gt;blue wall of silence&lt;/a&gt;” – the refusal to “snitch” on other officers – as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=JnfjSotiQ8IC&amp;amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;defining feature of U.S. cop culture&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet both soldiers and police officers put their lives on the line for their team every day. So what explains these two armed forces’ divergent attitudes toward bad behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Military ethics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://centerforlaw.org/dwight-bio&quot;&gt;military lawyer and scholar&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve studied this unique aspect of American military ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. military culture stresses organizational, rather than personal, loyalty. When Gallagher’s SEAL colleagues reported him, they were doing what Navy SEALs are taught to do: They put the good of the institution before the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Understand new developments in science, health and technology, each week.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/us/newsletters/science-editors-picks-71/?utm_source=TCUS&amp;amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-text&amp;amp;utm_content=science-understand&quot;&gt;Subscribe to The Conversation’s science newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the pride Marines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2018/03/16/5-reasons-to-love-the-marine-corps/&quot;&gt;famously feel&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, comes from being part of this well-respected corps. Personal relationships with other Marines are of secondary importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability for individual misdeeds is written into U.S. military law. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, culpability for criminal conduct is not avoided simply because a &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&amp;amp;context=auilr&quot;&gt;superior ordered&lt;/a&gt; a criminal act to be committed. Only lawful orders are to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A soldier is reasoning agent,” a military court explained in the 1991 case &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4317092182074870053&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr&quot;&gt;U.S. v. Kinder&lt;/a&gt;, in which a soldier who killed a civilian was convicted of murder on the grounds that his superior’s order to do so was obviously illegal and should have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a fallacy of widespread consumption that a soldier is required to do everything a superior officers tells him to do,” the ruling concluded, referencing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcourts.com/imt/eng/decisions/1948.04.09_United_States_v_Ohlendorf.pdf&quot;&gt;Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals&lt;/a&gt; after World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every soldier follows the rules, of course. The U.S. military has covered up atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notorious of these cases include the 1968 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/opinion/the-truth-behind-my-lai.html&quot;&gt;My Lai massacre&lt;/a&gt; in Vietnam, in which women and children were killed. In 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib&quot;&gt;U.S. soldiers badly mistreated detainees at Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But deeply ingrained military ethics generally make military members wary of the kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/milrv126&amp;amp;div=7&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=&quot;&gt;group think&lt;/a&gt; that holds up the “blue wall of silence” in police departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/nyregion/24serpico.html&quot;&gt;detective Frank Serpico&lt;/a&gt; made the power of the blue wall infamous. While working for the NYPD in the 1960s, Serpico observed his colleagues running racketeering operations and punching suspects for fun. When he brought the corruption to light, he was shot in the face in a setup orchestrated by fellow officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ethic is alive and well today, as former Baltimore detective Joe Crystal learned in 2011. Crystal was a rising star in the Baltimore police department. But after telling his superiors that a fellow officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baltimore-joe-crystal_n_7582374?guccounter=1&quot;&gt;brutally beat&lt;/a&gt; a handcuffed suspect, he was demoted, threatened and harassed until he quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you snitch, your career is done,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ex-baltimore-labeled-rat-police-brutality-claim-article-1.2077632&quot;&gt;he was told&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2011 lawsuit Crystal filed against the department for failing to protect him from retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police reluctance to report a fellow officer stems from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=JnfjSotiQ8IC&amp;amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;politicization&lt;/a&gt; of police brutality incidents and the widespread perception among police that nobody outside law enforcement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.policeone.com/use-of-force/articles/seattle-cops-say-city-playing-politics-with-their-lives-aUzkL8UtkGnQxtPV/&quot;&gt;understands their dangerous jobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2016&amp;amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory&quot;&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. Frustrated at being judged by civilians and public officials who don’t face the life-and-death decisions they do, cops tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prearesourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/library/1-civilianoversightofthepolicebobb2003.pdf&quot;&gt;close ranks when things go wrong&lt;/a&gt;, police monitors find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No political interference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military is also wary of political interference in military matters. That’s why it takes internal justice seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense is the only governmental organization allowed to operate its own internal criminal justice system – a privilege as remarkable as it is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civilian judiciary has long been skeptical of the military’s judicial system. The courts used to worry about due process, particularly the ability of military commanders to &lt;a href=&quot;https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojlege31&amp;amp;div=45&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=&quot;&gt;improperly influence&lt;/a&gt; the outcome of trials. In 1969, the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/258/&quot;&gt;severely restricted&lt;/a&gt; the jurisdiction of military courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Courts-martial as an institution are singularly inept in dealing with the subtleties of constitutional law,” the court &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/258/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in O'Callahan v. Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ruling limited the military justice system to handling purely military offenses, such as abandoning their post or behaving insubordinately. Serious allegations like murder and rape had to be tried in civilian courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Congress and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/milrv126&amp;amp;div=7&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=&quot;&gt;American Bar Association&lt;/a&gt; made significant &lt;a href=&quot;https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/armylaw2012&amp;amp;div=70&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=&quot;&gt;structural changes&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen due process in the military, the Supreme Court in 1987 &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/483/435/&quot;&gt;restored the jurisdiction of the courts-martial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, military judicial proceedings are supposed to be free from political interference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6226&amp;amp;context=law_lawreview&quot;&gt;even by the commander-in-chief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Undue influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Trump turned Gallagher’s court-martial earlier this year into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/military/story/2019-11-29/all-the-seals-men-the-fox-news-campaign-that-made-eddie-gallagher-untouchable&quot;&gt;media spectacle&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2019/11/27/timeline-gallahers-war-crimes-trump-intervention/4305986002/&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; his support for the former commando, he almost certainly influenced the outcome of the trial. Gallagher was acquitted of all but one charge and sentenced to time served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Glad I could help,” the president later &lt;a href=&quot;https://taskandpurpose.com/trump-congrats-eddie-gallagher&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/trump-navy-seal-war-crimes.html?auth=login-email&amp;amp;login=email&quot;&gt;punished&lt;/a&gt; the prosecutors who handled Gallagher’s court-martial, revoking their service medals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was the chief of military justice for the California National Guard, I tried dozens of courts-martials, convicting soldiers for larceny, battery and rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could usually get soldiers to level with me, even when telling the truth meant revealing the malfeasance of friends or superiors. They had confidence in the integrity of the military’s legal system, I felt – an understanding that they would be safe if they did the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the post-Gallagher era, is that still true? Or will a “camouflage wall of silence” rise?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Verizon suspends advertising on Facebook, joins growing boycott</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ads-boycott-verizon/verizon-suspends-advertising-on-facebook-joins-growing-boycott-idUSKBN23W3HK</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ads-boycott-verizon/verizon-suspends-advertising-on-facebook-joins-growing-boycott-idUSKBN23W3HK</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday it was pausing advertising on Facebook Inc in July, in support of a campaign that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon is the biggest yet to join the advertising boycott, which has gained the backing of dozens of U.S. companies, and its announcement was a blow to Facebook’s efforts to contain the growing revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable,” a Verizon representative said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. civil rights groups are urging brands to support the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which protests the world’s biggest social network’s lax approach to hate speech, harassment and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Defamation League said in a letter to advertisers on Thursday it had found a Verizon ad on Facebook appearing next to a video containing anti-Semitic rhetoric from conspiracy group QAnon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advertisements are running alongside divisive, hateful and conspiratorial content - not something that most companies want,” the ADL said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream brand Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s and outdoor gear companies Patagonia and The North Face earlier said they would suspend Facebook ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said it is working with civil rights organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We respect any brand’s decision and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information,” said Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company intensified outreach to advertisers this week as it worked to contain the damage, without pledging any specific changes, recipients of those messages said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Facebook’s top spenders, consumer goods giant Procter &amp;amp; Gamble Co, on Wednesday pledged to conduct a review of ad platforms and stop spending where it found hateful content. P&amp;amp;G declined to say if it had reached a decision on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
