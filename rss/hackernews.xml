<title>lsix: ls for images</title>
<link>https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/thumb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &quot;ls&quot;, but for images. Shows thumbnails in terminal using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sixel&lt;/a&gt; graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;lsix [ FILES ... ]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just typing &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; will show images in the current working directory. You can also specify filenames and, of course, use shell wild cards (e.g., &lt;code&gt;lsix *jpg *png&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because lsix uses ImageMagick pretty much any image format will be supported. However, some may be slow to render (like PDF), so lsix doesn't show them unless you ask specifically. If you want to force a listing of a certain type of image simply specify the filenames or use a wildcard (&lt;code&gt;*.pdf&lt;/code&gt; in the example below),.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example 1 of lsix usage&quot; title=&quot;Most basic usage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expanding GIFs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you specify a GIF (or actually any file that has multiple images in it) on the command line, all the frames will get expanded and shown in a montage. For example, &lt;code&gt;lsix nyancat.gif&lt;/code&gt; shows all the frames. Note that GIF stores some frames as only the pixels that differ from the previous frame. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example 2 of lsix usage&quot; title=&quot;GIFs get expanded&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Terminal background color is detected&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that PNGs and SVG files have correct alpha channel for the terminal background. That is because lsix uses terminal escape sequences to try to figure out your foreground and background colors. (Foreground is used for the text fill color.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first example below, after running &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; in a white on black xterm, I sent an escape sequence to swap foreground and background colors. When I ran it again, &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; detected it and changed the background color to white. Of course, you can pick whatever default colors you want (e.g., &lt;code&gt;xterm -bg blue&lt;/code&gt;, in the second example below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example 3 of lsix usage&quot; title=&quot;Reverse video works&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example 4 of lsix usage&quot; title=&quot;Even 'xterm -bg blue' works&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works great over ssh. Perfect for manipulating those images on the web server when you can't quite remember what each one was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-bitmap graphics often work fine (.svg, .eps, .pdf, .xcf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically detects if your terminal, like xterm, can increase the number of color registers to improve the image quality and does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically detects terminal's foreground and background colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terminals that support dtterm WindowOps, the number of tiles per row will adjust appropriately to the window width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are many images in a directory (&amp;gt;21), lsix will display them one row at a time so you don't need to wait for the entire montage to be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your filenames are too long, lsix will wrap the text before passing it into ImageMagick's &lt;code&gt;montage&lt;/code&gt;. (Without lsix, &lt;code&gt;montage&lt;/code&gt; just jumbles long filenames on top of one another.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily change things like the width of each tile in the montage, the font family, and point size by editing simple variables at the top of the file. &lt;em&gt;(Tip: try &lt;code&gt;convert -list font&lt;/code&gt; to see what fonts you have on your machine.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode filenames work fine, as long as your font has the glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/lsix&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file in your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin) and run it. It's just a BASH shell script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only prerequisite software is ImageMagick. If you don't have it yet, your OS's package manager will make it easy to get. (E.g., &lt;code&gt;apt-get install imagemagick&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your Terminal must support Sixel graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed this on an xterm in vt340 emulation mode, but I believe this should work on pretty much any Sixel compatible terminal. Xterm does not have Sixel mode enabled by default, so you need to either run it like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;xterm -ti vt340
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, make vt340 the default terminal type for xterm. Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;.Xresources&lt;/code&gt; file and run &lt;code&gt;xrdb -merge .Xresources&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;! Allow sixel graphics. (Try: &quot;convert -colors 16 foo.jpg sixel:-&quot;).
xterm*decTerminalID     :       vt340
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detecting screen size requires xterm configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using xterm, to have &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; automatically adjust how many tiles it shows based on your window size, you'll need to add the following to your .Xresources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;! Allow lsix to read the terminal window size (op #14)
xterm*allowWindowOps      : False
xterm*disallowedWindowOps : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,18,19,20,21,GetSelection,SetSelection,SetWinLines,SetXprop
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xterm's configuration for this is rather recondite. In order to allow the operation checking the window size (#14), we have to tell xterm to not to allow window ops, but then we explicitly list the ops disallowed, and it just happens that that list does not include the number 14. (This is very silly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; is currently designed to be very simple, there are no command line flags, no configuration files, no knobs to twiddle, or frobs to frobnosticate. However, since the script is so simple, if you want to make a change, it's pretty easy to do just by editing the file. Everything is nicely commented with the most common default variables at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact the author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I welcome feedback. If you use lsix and like it or have suggestions for how it can be improved, please go ahead and send your thoughts to me &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/issues/new&quot;&gt;@hackerb9&lt;/a&gt; via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen width is currently limited to 1000px due to a misfeature in xterm which caused it to silently show nothing. This limitation will be removed once xterm can handle images greater than 1000x1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directories specified on the command line should perhaps be processed as if the user had cd'd to that directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filenames that begin with &quot;@&quot; are special to ImageMagick and it'll freak out if you don't prepend a directory. (&lt;code&gt;lsix ./@foo.png&lt;/code&gt;) (This is a bug in ImageMagick, not lsix.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifying the empty string &lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; as a filename makes ImageMagick hang. (This appears to be an ImageMagick bug / misfeature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long filenames are wrapped, but not intelligently. Would it complicate this script too much to make it prefer to wrap on whites space, dashes, underscores, and periods? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;lsix foo.avi&lt;/code&gt;, you're asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixel standard, at least as implemented by xterm, doesn't appear to have a way to query the size of the graphics screen. Reading the VT340 documentation, it appears your program has to already know the resolution of the device you're rendering on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way to read the window size using the dtterm WindowOps extension but it is not quite the right solution and it is not enabled by default in xterm. The geometry of the Sixel graphics screen is not necessarily the same as the window size. (For example, xterm limits the graphics geometry to 1000x1000, even though the window can actually be larger.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, if your terminal can handle it, &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; will use the dtterm WindowOps to read your window size, but the chances of that working are slim. For most people &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; will assume you are on a VT340 (800x480) and can fit only 6 tiles per row. (I've e-mailed a proposed extension to the protocol to Thomas E. Dickey, maintainer of xterm.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixel standard also lacks a way to query the number of color registers available. I used the extensions from &lt;code&gt;xterm&lt;/code&gt; to do so, but I do not know how widely implemented they are. If a terminal does not respond, &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; presumes you're on an original vt340 and uses only 16 color registers. (Sorry, 4-gray vt330 users! Time to upgrade. ;-) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel&quot;&gt;libsixel&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent project for writing programs that can output optimized Sixel graphics commands. Because I have a lot of respect for the project, I feel I should explain why &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; does not use libsixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) I wanted lsix to work everywhere easily. Bash and imagemagick are ubiquitous, so a shell script is a natural solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) I wanted &lt;code&gt;lsix&lt;/code&gt; to be simple enough that it could be easily customized and extended by other people. (Including myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) ImageMagick has better support for reading different formats than stb_image (the library used by libsixel's &lt;code&gt;img2sixel&lt;/code&gt;). (For example: xpm, svg, 16-bit png, and even sixel files are not recognized by img2sixel). Since ImageMagick can read all of those and write sixel output directly, it made sense to use it for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) While libsixel is optimized and would surely be faster than ImageMagick, it's overkill. For a simple directory listing, this is plenty fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Rust 2019 and beyond: limits to some growth</title>
<link>https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/263429.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/263429.html</guid>
<description>&lt;br /&gt;This is a blog post (as solicited) about my suggestions for the Rust project in 2019 and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I am speaking only for myself, not anyone else, and not even as a very active participant in Rust anymore. Moreover these suggestions, to a large extent, apply to many projects. Rust is just one case, but one that is currently doing some conscious year-end reflection.&lt;p&gt;I should also note overall that I'm quite pleased by the trajectory of the Rust project and this suggestion is being made only in the spirit of keeping it healthy and on-track, avoiding some problems I observe developing in it, as a mostly-outsider these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm writing to make a recommendation about paying attention to -- acknowledging, planning, making explicit mechanisms and policy around the limits of -- the growth of two things in the project:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necessarily-shared technical artifacts, specifically the language definition itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strains on people participating in conversations about those artifacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, I want to draw attention (as others have done, with other words) to the fact that unlimited growth in both of these things is neither possible nor desirable, that there are natural limits, and that as with all natural systems reaching their growth limits, it will be better for everyone if the encounter with the limits is made in a controlled, planned fashion.&lt;p&gt;Note that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; writing about limits to the growth of many other areas of the project. It may be possible to have (say) a package index that is too big, or a website that is too big, or maybe even a user community that is too big; but it's not clear that those are problems yet for Rust, and I'm presently only talking about the two specific areas above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limiting factors and overshoots.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Every natural system has factors that limit its growth. That is why the universe is not (for example) a single amoeba expanding outwards at the speed of light. A system grows (and often its rate of growth grows too!) until it starts to encounter limiting factors, and then one by one the rate-of-rate-of-change, and then the rate-of-change, and finally the overall size of the system eventually all plateau. Typical growth patterns thus look something like a sigmoid or &quot;S-curve&quot;, gradually approaching some asymptote. At least when the limiting factors are encountered in a gradual or controlled fashion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Logistic-curve.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a system encounters its limits in an &lt;em&gt;uncontrolled&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;abrupt&lt;/em&gt; fashion, a phenomenon can occur that is more like an overshoot, or even oscillation: the limit still &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; but its effect is felt more in the form of collapse or crisis. The S-curve goes up to a peak, followed by a crash on the other side. That is what you don't want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples of control.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The Rust project has a few forms of process control -- that are, in essence, limits on rates of change and/or growth -- that I think are very judicious, and in part responsible for the success of the project so far. I'd like to couch the following recommendations by analogy to them. These process controls are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bors queue, generally gating changes on program-wide correctness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crater runs, generally gating releases on ecosystem-wide correctness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-based releases, generally avoiding having to consider whether to slip a schedule rather than cut a feature. The decision is made by the clock, and everything not-ready gets cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the project has grown some less-mechanized but nonetheless important social structures to manage the growth in people participating in the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CoC. It's not always remembered, but the CoC does not just talk about social justice and harassment and so forth. It also lays out boundaries around the signal:noise ratio in conversation, the use of other people's attention and time, and the need to accept tradeoffs (I wish I'd had the foresight to use the term &quot;zero-sum&quot; here because I should have: not every decision is non-zero-sum).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RFC process. This includes rules about the form, content, timing, set of participants and permitted and expected forms of discourse when discussing significant changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The governance model. This includes delineation of areas of responsibility, hierarchical delegation where necessary, roles and expectations of participants and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these are essentially acknowledgements that -- absent control -- overshoots can happen and crises (or at least a degree of chaos and dysfunction) may ensue. When possible, process controls are automatic and completely impartial (to minimize ill-will and subjective judgement, the temptation to cut corners, etc.) Where necessarily subjective, the norms and processes are at least clearly articulated in writing, in well-documented, easy-to-find places.&lt;h2&gt;Areas of concern.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the two areas of concern, then: I want to bring attention to these two areas where the project does not currently have adequate mechanisms or policies in place to control growth, that carry risks of eventual dysfunction or even crisis. In both, it is not clear to me how far from such crisis the project currently is; but either way I think it is worth acting sooner rather than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language itself&lt;/strong&gt;. Its definition. This is (unlike many parts of the project) a &lt;em&gt;necessarily shared&lt;/em&gt; technical artifact. Everyone has a stake in it, and every change potentially effects everyone. Moreover, everyone needs to learn and understand a substantial part of it: people do not have the option to ignore parts they are not interested in. Even parts one &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to ignore will occur in shared contexts: documentation and teaching material, testsuites and validation material, compiler internals, formal models, other people's codebases, overall maintenance burden, etc. etc.&lt;p&gt;The limiting factors to the growth of the language &lt;em&gt;as an artifact&lt;/em&gt; then, include at least the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability for a beginner to learn the language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability for an intermediate user to feel confident, adapt to others' codebases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability for an expert or maintainer to know all (or most) of it, evaluate changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost:benefit ratio of each new change, in terms of new and ongoing work that it incurs, vs. the number of people or use-cases that benefit from it. The costs are combinatorial with many dimensions of the project and language size, and almost always increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The risks of overshooting these limits are potentially quite serious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsound language changes. Say: failure to maintain a critical safety guarantee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reputation for overcomplexity, loss of users. Becoming the next C++ or Haskell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower-quality features with incomplete definition, testing, documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under-used features that simply absorb effort needed elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragmentation into dialects, unsharable codebases, lower value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;strains on the people&lt;/strong&gt; working on the language. Some parts of the project can be delegated, de-synchronized, proceed in parallel with as many hands are available to work on them. Not so the shared technical artifacts. To some extent, many people (and an increasingly-many people) &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be involved in &lt;em&gt;nearly all&lt;/em&gt; changes, and that means that there's a lot of pressure both for everyone in that group-of-many to &quot;keep up&quot; with all the discourse occurring, and for the standard of what it means to &quot;keep up&quot; to gradually creep upwards as both more changes are proposed, and more voices contribute to each discussion.&lt;p&gt;The limiting factors to the growth of these strains &lt;em&gt;on participating people&lt;/em&gt; include at least the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of hours in a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; hours in a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsibilities and interests in things outside the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reservoirs of mental energy to understand what's being discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust in the judgement of everyone participating in a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reservoirs of psychological and emotional energy to read and discuss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presumption of good faith in everyone participating in a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The risks of overshooting these limits are also potentially quite serious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor decisions made through exhaustion or attrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnifying inequality: only the most-privileged, available, energetic, well-paid or otherwise well-situated participants can keep up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrowing of discourse, from careful consideration to &quot;winning arguments&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People acting out, burning out, behaving poorly, departing project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration, accusation of bad faith, grudges, conspiratorial thinking, forks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize that the limits and risks I've outlined here are quite independent of people, topics, or even the Rust project generally. They will occur to varying degrees anywhere and with anyone. Simply swapping out the current maintainers (say) for your preferred people will not actually solve them: the limits will re-occur. The only solution is to manage the encounter with the limits. Put some controls in place.&lt;h2&gt;Suggested controls.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is the hard part and the part I'm going to leave least-definite. It's essential, after all, that the project adopt controls of its own volition rather than feeling that they're imposed from outside. I think the project needs to pause, reflect, consider collectively, and put some controls in place. I will therefore only offer a few possible suggestions here, not terribly structured but in the spirit of the holidays: as a bunch of possibly-interesting gifts to unwrap, look over, and decide whether to keep or swap for something more to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace negative space. Make a process for defining features and concepts &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the future trajectory of the language. Allow (or encourage) RFCs that say &quot;Rust will never have X&quot; for some value of X. While this sounds &quot;negative&quot; -- and it is, the word is written on the label -- it's a one-time thing where objections can be honestly considered with a long-term horizon (&quot;never&quot; is quite some time!) and given fair discussion, but then put to rest rather than being a perennial source of lingering conflict. A few examples where one might want to find and articulate negative spaces: paint certain categories of expressivity permanently out of the type system (eg. dependent types, HKTs, etc.), or out of the grammar (eg. parameter qualifiers, positional or keyword args), or out of the set of kinds of item (eg. anonymous record types), or out of the set of inference obligations in the middle-end (eg. constant value synthesis, implicit arguments). Put some hard limits in place, both to avoid those features themselves, and also to avoid people &quot;putting pieces in place&quot; that exist only to eventually-enable them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front-load costs, make them explicit. Taking a page from webassembly's change process, make it clear that moving an RFC past a very early phase is going to require a commensurate investment in implementation, formalization, documentation revision, teaching-materials revision, test-writing, maintenance and so forth. Absent a way to cover the costs, defer changes &quot;nobody has yet been found to pay for&quot; at that stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a learning-rate and book-length target. Try to work backwards from the amount of time and number of pages it &quot;should take&quot; to learn the language, or become expert in it, then cut things that go beyond that. If &quot;teach yourself Rust in 21 days&quot; isn't going to work, figure out what should. Three months? Six? A year? Think about languages that &quot;definitely take too long&quot;, and pick a number that's less than that. Is a thousand page manual healthy? Five hundred? Three hundred?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set other mechanized limits: lines of code in the compiler, overall time to bootstrap, dollars spent per day on AWS instances, number of productions in the grammar, number of inference rules in the type system, percent test coverage, percent of documents allowed to be marked as &quot;incomplete&quot;, etc. Get creative, figure out meaningful things you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; measure and then put mechanisms in place to limit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate-limit activity based on explicit personal-time-budgeting: ballpark-figure how many hours (or paid hours) per person are realistically available without exhaustion or burnout -- including the least-privileged but still necessary participants -- and work backwards to figure out how many hours of participation and review &quot;should be&quot; digested per team, per release cycle, thus how much work gets scheduled. Then cut or defer things that go beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the moderator team to apply rate limits or cooling-off periods to particular discussions &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes an outside perspective that a discussion is just too heated overall is an easier way to de-escalate than shining a spotlight on a single person's behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with the moderator team: grow an additional cross-project team that does budgeting and auditing of load levels &lt;em&gt;in other teams&lt;/em&gt;. This can be effective because the auditing/budgeting team sees their work as helping people to say no to the right things, rather than the default stance most people will have when participating in a team, to say yes to too many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just some ideas to outline the very general family of thing I am suggesting. I'm sure you can come up with more possible and more plausible ways of controlling the encounter with limits to the language's size and the personal strains of working on it. The Rust community has shown itself to be quite admirably creative, reflective and self-critical over the years. For this you should be commended. I hope this post is taken in the the same vein of constructive criticism.&lt;p&gt;Happy new year, and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Apple needs to change iPhone’s call UI because robocalls are killing us</title>
<link>https://spencerdailey.com/2018/12/26/in-2019-apple-needs-to-change-iphones-call-ui-because-robocalls-are-killing-us/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spencerdailey.com/2018/12/26/in-2019-apple-needs-to-change-iphones-call-ui-because-robocalls-are-killing-us/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Right now, any robocall hacker in the world can instantly take over your phone’s screen, knocking you out of your mobile gaming experience, disrupting you as you check out at the store, or breaking your concentration as you try and type out an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And disrupt they do, at a massive scale. Several billion fake calls are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/180506/p13#a180506p13&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/180506/p13#a180506p13&quot;&gt;each month &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/180506/p13#a180506p13&quot;&gt;in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Reports show this is a global problem, with Brazilians &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/181218/p32#a181218p32&quot;&gt;averaging 37 spam calls per month&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, I’m getting a robocall as I type this very sentence, my second today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the telelphony-infrastructure level, it’s a supremely difficult problem that lacks a short-term fix because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7#Protocol_security_vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;the underlying protocol is hopelessly insecure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from a user-experience perspective, there’s a simple way to make things more manageable. Apple should let incoming calls show up as a banner notification, not a full screen alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.15.24-PM-1024x696.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-70&quot; srcset=&quot;https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.15.24-PM-1024x696.png 1024w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.15.24-PM-300x204.png 300w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.15.24-PM-768x522.png 768w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.15.24-PM.png 1472w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;What was magical in 2007 has become a major annoyance
&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely bonkers that millions of smartphone users get their full screen taken over by robocallers on a daily basis. Tapping Decline is not a great option because it actually tells the robocaller that you’re with your phone and are annoyed by the call, information I’d rather not give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jailbreak community for iOS saw this need years ago, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ioshacker.com/cydia/callreply-tweak-lets-you-accept-or-decline-calls-through-a-banner&quot;&gt;an app called CallReply&lt;/a&gt; tweaked the phone UI to let incoming calls appear as banner notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will Apple follow suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18764770&quot;&gt;on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; pointed out: “This annoyance is three-fold when a call from your iPhone also takes over your iPad screen and rings on your MacBook.”[&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18764832&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] Fair point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another exclaims there’s lack of call filtering options available in iOS, I completely agree – as blocking individual numbers is totally ineffective in blocking robocall spam. “I would love to be able to block all numbers coming from my area code and the first 3 digits of my number.. all my robo calls come from a number that looks just like mine.” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18764895&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another points out, the carriers could taking some steps to limit robocalls, but may be dragging their feet because it’s (arguably) in their commercial interests to let it flourish. While I agree there’s a lot the carriers could be accomplishing in flagging “inauthentic” behavior of network participants, the root cause of SS7’s lack of authentication and encryption will remain. But yes, carriers are definitely on the hook for making things better too. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18764922&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another commenter remarks about how Google has dealt with this issue: “Fwiw, Android actually does do this. When the phone is unlocked, calls show up as a banner. In addition, they added that new call screening option, I’ve been using it and so far it has worked fairly well. Also, there is some built-in call filtering and third party apps as well, though I have mostly been able to rely on the built-in filtering. Does iOS really not have any options for filtering? I swear last time I had an iPhone (running iOS9) there was Something… but then again, I was jailbroken. It’s a bit funny that we got full web browsers on phones before proper call filtering. (Disclaimer: I work for Google but not on phones.)” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18765059&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As Bitcoin Sinks, Industry Startups Are Forced to Cut Back</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/26/as-bitcoin-sinks-industry-startups-are-forced-to-cut-back/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/26/as-bitcoin-sinks-industry-startups-are-forced-to-cut-back/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Around this time last year, the price of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; hit an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/900-20000-bitcoins-historic-2017-price-run-revisited&quot;&gt;all-time high&lt;/a&gt; of nearly $20,000. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts everywhere boasted about the wealth 2018 would bring, initial coin offerings exploded and startups continued to pull in &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2018-vc-investment-crypto-startups-set-surpass-2017-tally/&quot;&gt;record amounts of venture capital&lt;/a&gt;. Fast-forward one year: Bitcoin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin&quot;&gt;is down 75 percent to a meager $3,700,&lt;/a&gt; sinking as quickly as its meteoric rise, and industry startups are paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest victim is &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitmain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;bitmain&quot;&gt;Bitmain,&lt;/a&gt; a provider of bitcoin mining hardware that very recently submitted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hkexnews.hk/APP/SEHK/2018/2018092406/Documents/SEHK201809260017.pdf&quot;&gt;its IPO prospectus&lt;/a&gt; to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The company confirmed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/layoffs-underway-amid-business-adjustments-bitcoin-miner-bitmain-confirms&quot;&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt; this week that cutbacks would begin imminently: “There has been some adjustment to our staff this year as we continue to build a long-term, sustainable and scalable business,” a spokesperson for Bitmain told &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/coindesk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;coindesk&quot;&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;. “A part of that is having to really focus on things that are core to that mission and not things that are auxiliary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing-based Bitmain hasn’t clarified just how many of its employees will be impacted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/2179513/chinas-cryptocurrency-giants-bitmain-and-huobi-plan-lay-offs-amid&quot;&gt;though rumors — which Bitmain has since denied — on Maimai&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese LinkedIn-like platform, suggest as many as 50 percent of the company’s headcount could be laid off. This news comes after the crypto mining giant confirmed it had shuttered its Israeli development center, Bitmaintech Israel, laying off 23 employees in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitmain employs at least 2,000 people, up from 250 in 2016, according to PitchBook, as the company’s growth has skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1762953&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout size-full wp-image-1762953&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fullsizeoutput_7a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;560&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The decreasing value of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The crypto market has undergone a shake-up in the past few months, which has forced Bitmain to examine its various activities around the globe and to refocus its business in accordance with the current situation,” Bitmaintech Israel head Gadi Glikberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-bitmain-closing-israeli-development-center-1001264083#utm_source=RSS&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; told his employees at the time of the layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitmain has raised more than $800 million in venture capital funding from Sequoia, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/coatue-management&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;coatue-management&quot;&gt;Coatue Management,&lt;/a&gt; SoftBank and more. At a valuation of $12 billion, it quickly soared to become the most valuable crypto startup in the world, surpassing &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;coinbase&quot;&gt;Coinbase,&lt;/a&gt; which itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/&quot;&gt;garnered an $8 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt; this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its IPO filing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/bitmain-hong-kong-ipo/&quot;&gt;Bitmain reported more than $2.5 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; last year, up nearly 10x on the $278 million it claimed for 2016. As for the first half of 2018, Bitmain said it surpassed $2.8 billion in revenue. These are astonishing numbers, yes, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/bitmain-ipo-concerns/&quot;&gt;whether Bitmain can sustain this kind of momentum&lt;/a&gt; has been called into question, especially as it gears up to go public in what would be the largest crypto-related IPO to date. The crypto market, by nature, is unpredictable — a characteristic that’s less than favorable to public market investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Startups sacrifice staff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/huobi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;huobi&quot;&gt;Huobi&lt;/a&gt; Group, a crypto trading platform also headquartered in Beijing, is laying off a portion of its 1,000 employees, too, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/2179513/chinas-cryptocurrency-giants-bitmain-and-huobi-plan-lay-offs-amid&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the South China Morning Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huobi, which is backed by Sequoia and ZhenFund, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1762974&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-910070334.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;717&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Brooklyn-based &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/consensus-systems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;consensus-systems&quot;&gt;ConsenSys earlier&lt;/a&gt; this month confirmed it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/consensys-confirms-layoffs-projecting-13-of-staff-at-startups-to-be-cut&quot;&gt;laying off 13 percent of its 1,200-person staff&lt;/a&gt;. The company, active in the crypto ecosystem, incubates and invests in decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Excited as we are about ConsenSys 2.0, our first step in this direction has been a difficult one: we are streamlining several parts of the business including ConsenSys Solutions, spokes, and hub services, leading to a 13% reduction of mesh members,” ConsenSys founder and crypto billionaire &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/joseph-lubin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;joseph-lubin&quot;&gt;Joseph Lubin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-studio-consensys-to-trim-workforce-amid-bear-market-woes/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a letter to employees regarding the layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Steemit, a distributed app designed to reward content creators, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/steemit-a-decentralized-sharing-system-lays-of-70-of-staff/&quot;&gt;laid off 70 percent of its staff&lt;/a&gt; just days earlier, citing poor market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still believe that Steem can be by far the best, and lowest cost, blockchain protocol for applications and that the improvements that will result from this new direction will make it far better for application sustainability,” founder and chief executive officer Ned Scott wrote in a statement. “However, in order to ensure that we can continue to improve Steem, we need to first get costs under control to remain economically sustainable. There’s nothing that I want more now than to survive, to keep steemit.com operating, and keep the mission alive, to make great communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsizing following periods of rapid growth — which many crypto startups experienced during &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/why-is-bitcoins-price-so-high/&quot;&gt;the Bitcoin boom&lt;/a&gt; — is only natural, but can these businesses continue to endure periods of extreme volatility without crashing completely? One thing is certain: If the price of Bitcoin sinks further and further, “staff adjustments” at crypto startups large and small will be unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sam Harris, the polemical atheist neuroscientist known for his popular podcast “Waking Up,” was making tens of thousands of dollars a month from fans who donated to him through Patreon, a crowdfunding site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That stopped this month. On Dec. 6, Patreon kicked the anti-feminist polemic Carl Benjamin, who works under the name Sargon of Akkad, off its site for using racist language on YouTube. That same week, it removed the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos a day after he opened an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The moves prompted a revolt. Mr. Harris, citing worries about censorship, announced that he would leave Patreon. He was joined in protest by about half a dozen other prominent members of the site, including the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;conservative-leaning psychologist&lt;/a&gt; Jordan Peterson and the libertarian podcaster Dave Rubin, who also earn money from Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“These recent expulsions seem more readily explained by political bias,” Mr. Harris wrote to his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The furor is a microcosm of the conflicts that are playing out across the internet as technology platforms try to limit the spread of hateful speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This year, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all drawn increasingly stark lines around what constitutes hate speech and are figuring out how to enforce those rules. In August, for example, Apple, Google and Facebook banned the right-wing conspiracy theorist &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt; for violating hate speech rules, setting off a cascading effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But as tech platforms try to get a handle on the issue, they are stoking the ire of their content creators, many of whom brand themselves as free speech warriors. Some accuse the companies of censorship. Others say the tech sites are biased and that hate speech is an ambiguous term. Now the digital dissent is becoming increasingly widespread, upending even smaller websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Patreon, founded in 2013 by Jack Conte, a musician and disc jockey, is valued at $450 million and employs about 170 people in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McAuley for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The concept of hate speech is irreducibly subjective and vague,” said Nadine Strossen, author of “Hate: Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Patreon, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/technology/how-the-internet-is-saving-culture-not-killing-it.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;founded in 2013 by Jack Conte&lt;/a&gt;, a musician and disc jockey, is valued at $450 million and employs about 170 people in San Francisco. Fans donate to the content creators on the site whom they enjoy, and Patreon takes a 5 percent cut of the income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While the site is relatively small, with a little over 100,000 creators and two million people donating monthly to those creators, it has become the de facto paycheck for a cohort of prominent self-styled internet philosophers who eschew or have been ousted from traditional bastions like universities or magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Among Patreon’s hodgepodge of creators is the left-leaning podcast group Chapo Trap House, which makes more than $110,000 a month from the site, according to Graphtreon, which tracks Patreon activity. Mr. Peterson, a best-selling author, earns around $66,000 a month from the site. Sex-related content creators are also getting monthly subscribers on Patreon, and a Pokemon Go community is the top earner, making up to $500,000 a month, according to Graphetreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Patreon takes a highly personal approach to policing speech. While Google and Facebook use algorithms as a first line of defense for questionable content, Patreon has human moderators. They give warnings and reach out to talk to offenders, presenting options for “education” and “reform.” Some activists hope this will become a model for a better and kinder internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“There are no automated takedowns,” Mr. Conte said. “As a creator myself dealing with these big tech platforms and getting an automated takedown notice, there’s no appeals process. You can’t talk to a human. And I never want to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Jaqueline Hart, Patreon’s head of trust and safety, said her team watches for and will investigate complaints about any content posted on Patreon and on other sites like YouTube and Facebook that violates what it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defines as hate speech&lt;/a&gt;. That includes “serious attacks, or even negative generalizations, of people based on their race [and] sexual orientation,” she has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;If someone has breached Patreon’s policy, the company contacts the offender with a specific plan, which usually involves asking for the content to be removed and for a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Hart said around 10 percent of Patreon employees were dedicated to her trust and safety team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McAuley for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The conversations with creators can quickly become complicated, nuanced, and, well, human, she said. Among other challenges, Patreon has to decide what qualifies as a sincere and thorough apology. Still, having human moderators has changed its users’ behaviors more than simply deleting accounts would, Ms. Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We hand-hold creators, and we work with them one on one, and nearly every creator reforms — and so it’s quite a successful process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The work takes up a large amount of resources. Ms. Hart said around 10 percent of Patreon employees are dedicated to her team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This month, the site’s moderators received a complaint about Mr. Benjamin, who had risen to fame railing against diversity and feminism during &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/technology/gamergate-women-video-game-threats-anita-sarkeesian.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the GamerGate movement in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Benjamin used the N-word and anti-gay language during an interview posted to YouTube on Feb. 7, Patreon found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Dec. 6, the company told Mr. Benjamin that it would freeze his account and that he could appeal. Mr. Benjamin objected and said the video in question should not fall under Patreon’s rules because it was on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For Mr. Benjamin, the timing was surprising. “My brand has been politically incorrect for years,” he said in a video he later posted to his YouTube channel called “The Patreon Witch Trials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Benjamin, who did not respond to requests for comment, has 870,000 subscribers on YouTube and had more than 3,000 subscribers on Patreon, from which he had been making around $12,000 a month. Many of his videos show just a static cartoon or a series of images, with his voice speaking against movements for gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;More recently, Mr. Benjamin has moved from the fringe toward the heart of the new right. In October, he posted an hourlong interview with Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Patreon’s definition of hate speech includes “serious attacks, or even negative generalizations, of people based on their race [and] sexual orientation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McAuley for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Benjamin did not respond to attempts to engage him in the reform process, Ms. Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“His response to us when we told him about the reform process was to nitpick and say, ‘I was being anti-Nazi,’” Ms. Hart said. “You cannot say those words on our platform. It doesn’t matter who you’re directing them at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;His removal from Patreon immediately stirred up others on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I think the most likely outcome, if this continues, is that all contentious speech or behavior will put the speaker or actor at risk of serious financial and social sanctions, and strip them of all defense,” Mr. Peterson wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Rubin, the libertarian podcaster, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1074729149703409665&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “The Platform War has begun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Rubin and Mr. Peterson said they plan to start their own version of Patreon, which will be less censorious. Mr. Peterson said his Patreon subscriptions had dropped to around 7,500, from about 10,000 over the summer, according to Graphtreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s unclear how effective Mr. Peterson’s and Mr. Rubin’s efforts will be. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/technology/alt-right-internet.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alternatives to mainstream sites&lt;/a&gt;, such as the white supremacy-oriented Hatreon, have largely been failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And while many internet creators argue that Silicon Valley is trying to censor free speech, what the companies are doing is legal, said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s speech, privacy and technology project. “The First Amendment right is on the side of the company,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those quitting Patreon in solidarity with Mr. Benjamin may have other motives behind their sudden outrage, Mr. Conte said. As content creators using the site grow more famous and their income more significant, the 5 percent cut that Patreon takes of their donations may have begun to seem cumbersome, he said. Other large creators &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SwordAndScale/status/1074934600269524992&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are joining the rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You can use a press debacle like this to drum up your community and rile people up and get them to support a cause,” Mr. Conte said. “We welcome competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In his exit note from Patreon, Mr. Harris, who gathered his fan base as a pugnacious atheist and fierce critic of Islam, wrote that he wanted his business interests to be freed from the site. He singled out Ms. Hart’s team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I consider it no longer tenable to expose any part of my podcast funding to the whims of Patreon’s ‘Trust and Safety’ committee,” Mr. Harris wrote. He added a link to his own website, where fans can enter their credit card information and choose a monthly contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Why don&amp;#039;t I take military funding? (2004)</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;No Military Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/~kuipers/styles/essays.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;379.9305978327&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benjamin Kuipers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't take funding from military agencies. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it's a testimony that it's possible to have a successful career in computer science without taking military funding. My position has its roots in the Vietnam War, when I was a conscientious objector, did alternative service instead of submitting to the draft, and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers). During the 1980s and 90s, the position seemed to lose some of its urgency, so it became more of a testimony about career paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since September 11, 2001, all the urgency is back. The defense of our country is at stake, so this testimony becomes critical. In short, I believe that non-violent methods of conflict resolution provide the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; methods for protecting our country against the deadly threats we face in the long run. Military action, with its inevitable consequences to civilian populations, creates and fuels deadly threats, and therefore &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; the danger that our country faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will come back to this, but first some other thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How did you get started with this?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, after completing my PhD thesis on cognitive maps, I found that the only funding agency that was interested in supporting my research wanted to build smart cruise missiles that could find their way to their targets. This was not what I wanted my life's work to support. So I changed areas, and started working on AI in Medicine, which led to some very productive work on qualitative reasoning about physical systems with incomplete knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before that, I had been a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War, and had done alternative service to the draft from 1970 to 1972 before starting grad school. Since most of my graduate studies were funded by an NSF Fellowship, I didn't think much about military funding and AI research at that time. After finishing my PhD, I did a year of post-doctoral research funded by a grant that Al Stevens and I negotiated directly with Craig Fields at DARPA. It was at the end of that year, looking for continuation funding, that I confronted the cruise missile scenario and had to decide what my research life is for, and who I am willing to have pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But how can you fund your research?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense Department agencies like DARPA, ONR, AFOSR, and ARO are certainly among the larger pots of money out there, and I have put these off limits for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had funding from NSF, NASA, and NIH instead. There is a State of Texas Advanced Research Program that has supported several of my projects. And I have had small amounts of funding from several companies such as Tivoli and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These other agencies typically don't provide grants as large as one can get from DARPA, for example. So, there are limits to the size of research group I can have. With very few exceptions, I have decided that I will fund only grad students, and not try to support research staff or post-docs, who are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more expensive than grad students. I have sometimes had quite a few grad students, and a large lab, but the funding requirements remain moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first decided to refuse military funding, I felt I would be making a serious sacrifice. As it has worked out, research money has sometimes been tight, but never disastrously so. And as I watched my colleagues dealing with DARPA's demands for reports, PI meetings, bake-offs, delays and reductions in promised funding, and other hassles, I began to wonder whether I hadn't gotten the best side of the deal after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that the bottom line in research is productivity of ideas, not dollars brought in. At some point, the hassle of dealing with an agency may decrease one's intellectual productivity more than the money they provide increases it. But that's a practical issue, not a matter of conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that refusing military funding puts a limit on how large a research budget I can sustain. But that's not the same as limiting my intellectual productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's wrong with taking military money? They have funded lots of great research!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly so: AI and the Internet being two large categories of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of research is enormously important, and I am glad that our society finds a way to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the goal of the military is to settle international conflict through violence. As a friend of mine was told by a general, &quot;Everything we do ultimately has one of two goals: killing people or destroying things.&quot; I believe that this attitude towards conflict resolution has become a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to our world and our country. The world has become so small through transportation and communication, and our weapons have become so deadly, nuclear and biological, that we cannot afford the illusion that violence makes us safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true defense of our country would require both resources and research into non-violent conflict resolution methods. Both of these exist, but are starved compared with the technologies of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stand is a testimony, saying &quot;I will not devote my life's work toward making warfare more effective.&quot; I am also trying to show, by example, that one can be a successful and productive computer scientist, even while taking this stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Do you try to keep others from taking military funding?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Mine is an individual testimony, and each person makes an individual decision about how they will spend their life's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when William Penn converted to Quakerism and pacifism, he was troubled by the thought of having to give up the sword that he wore, a great honor at the time. He asked George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, what he should do. Fox told him, &quot;William, wear thy sword as long as thee can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why not use military funding for virtuous research?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it's a testimony, and a testimony has to be clear and visible to be useful. Certainly there is virtuous research funded by military agencies. Many colleagues whom I respect highly take this approach and I honor them for it. But it doesn't send a clear message to others, and I want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there's a slippery slope. You can start with a research project as pure as the driven snow. But a few years later, money is tight in the pure research category, and you get offered a research grant from a more applied office within the same agency. Do research on the same topic, but frame it in terms of a military mission. Step by step, you can slide into battlefield management and smart cruise missiles. One thing that makes the slope so slippery is that you have accumulated responsibility for a lab full of graduate students, and the consequences of a major drop in funding will be even more painful for them than it is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes the slope slippery is that military problems are often very interesting. It's easy to get caught up in an interesting technical challenge, and lose sight of what is actually happening: that the objects in the plan are human beings, and that the actions that are being planned are to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little cleverness, you can find similarly fascinating problems in the space program, where there is NASA funding, or in the economic sphere, where there is private funding. Or in other areas of science, where NSF and NIH do the funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is everything the military does tainted?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly not. Most people don't realize that the US military is perhaps the largest educational institution in the world. It provides valuable academic and vocational training to a huge population, many of whom might not have access to it otherwise. It also provides training in character and discipline that are hard to match elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are even signs that the professional military is reaching a clearer understanding than civilian policy-makers of the weaknesses of violence, and the strengths of non-violent approaches to conflict resolution. We may be moving toward the day when trained, disciplined soldiers will be able to move into a situation of conflict and restore civility and peace without loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a day worth working for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The military can use your research anyway, from the open literature. Why not have them pay for it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things have both good and evil uses. If I create new knowledge that can be used for either good or evil, and present it and evaluate in terms of the good purposes, then someone who converts it to evil use bears that responsibility. If I present it and evaluate it in terms of the evil purpose, then I make it that much easier and more likely for it to be used for evil. I must then bear the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is not very robust against speciousness and rationalization. If I make a rapid-fire machine gun firing armor-piercing bullets, and present it and evaluate it for the sport of target-shooting, I am deceiving myself (or more likely, not). Whoever funds the work, I am responsible for anticipating who is likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if I develop a new scheduling methodology for industrial processes, the military is likely to benefit, since it includes many industrial processes. But peaceful economic activity will benefit more, and the military benefits only in the aspects it shares with peaceful enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do work that makes the world a better place. The fact that the military becomes better too is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;(From a graduating senior) Should I consider military involvement when I choose a graduate school?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not too much, but keep your eyes and ears open when you visit the different schools. Most top graduate schools in computer science will have substantial amounts of military funding, but most will also have faculty who are seriously concerned about the militarization of research. You should look for a balance that leads to productive discussions, rather than a &quot;party line.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for faculty members who can guide you in directions you want to go. This means looking for both intellect and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Are you ever tempted by large military grants?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course. Recently a friend of mine, whom I respect highly, took a leadership position in a major agency, and created a research program I find enormously attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After struggling with the question for several weeks, I decided that the need for testimonies like mine was becoming greater, not less, in these difficult times, so I have reluctantly passed on this possibility. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that a course of action is right does not necessarily make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about September 11? We're under attack!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country suffered horrific losses from a terrible attack. The criminal gang responsible must be brought to justice, and we must protect ourselves against possible future attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, violent actions taken in the name of defense against terrorism are very likely to increase the likelihood and magnitude of future terrorist attacks. We need a combination of short-term vigilance and protection, and long-term efforts to reduce the problems that breed terrorism, both in non-violent ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much more to be said about this, probably in other opinion pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I am writing to ask for advice. I am one year away from graduating with a BS in computer science and am considering graduate school. When I started looking around my department for some research to get involved in, I was surprised to find how much of it relies on military funding. This lead me to find your essay on why you don't take military funding. I share your views and as tempting as it is, and as much as I feel I'm missing out on some really interesting projects, I've decided I will not work on anything that receives military support. So, I'm hoping you can offer further advice on how and where to look for grad programs. How do I find other faculty who share this concern for the militarization of research? Will I find more options overseas? How and when do I tell prospective schools about my decision?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me applaud you for your principled stand. As you have surely noticed, these are times that require good people to stand up and be counted, publically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I did alternative service as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam war, I did not decide to avoid military funding until a year after completing my PhD. I was fortunate to have obtained NSF and Danforth Fellowships that funded almost all of my graduate studies. After I became a faculty member, I got quite good at raising grants from NSF, NIH, NASA, and other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to do similar things, just starting earlier. There are a number of competitive fellowships for graduate study that you can apply for as an individual, and carry with you to your choice of graduate school. Many of these, like the NSF, the Hertz, the Gates, etc, are very competitive. It is a big advantage in such competitions to be clear on your own beliefs and your own priorities. Make sure you can express yourself in a clear and compelling way, and you have a significantly better chance. If you succeed in obtaining your own funding, it makes you much more desirable at top graduate programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of useful quotes for this enterprise are, &quot;Momma may have, and Poppa may have, but God bless the child who's got his own!&quot; and &quot;Be wise as serpents and gentle as doves.&quot; (Look them up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't get this kind of fellowship, there are plenty of options for supporting yourself through graduate school without military funding. You can be a teaching assistant; you can be a research assistant to a faculty member with other kinds of funding; you can find work maintaining computers for a lab in another department; you can get a part-time outside job; and so on. Generally, rejecting the single largest funder will require you to be more creative about looking at other funding possibilities. This creativity will serve you well. One of the fortunate things about working in computer science is that you have a practical skill that is needed by people in many different areas, and they are often willing to pay for your services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On finding faculty with similar beliefs, I would suggest just asking. A quick scan of each faculty member's web page, and especially the acknowledgements on publications, will tell you where they get their funding. Find a few people whose research you find attractive who have non-military funding, and talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find it most productive to be clear and straight-forward, without being judgmental or confrontational. You will very likely find plenty of people who are very sympathetic to your values, but who aren't willing to make what they perceive as too large a sacrifice. In my personal opinion, it is more important to encourage people to see their choice of work, how it's funded, and what it's used for as an important moral decision that must reflect their own fundamental values, than to pressure them to make the same moral decisions that I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt you will find better options overseas. I believe there is generally less funding available outside the US, and little of that would be available to a US student. There are some very fine graduate schools in other countries, but on average, the US has the best graduate schools in the world. Again, personally, I love this country, and I want my work and my life to help strengthen its good parts and help fix its problems. So I wouldn't want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How and when to tell is another judgment call. It depends on your own style, and how vocal a testimony you want to make. You may legitimately decide that this point is not relevant on the application for graduate school, or on the other hand, you may feel that it is central. You are not obliged to explain or justify every belief you have, however strongly held or controversial, to everyone you meet. You have to decide when you think it is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final point. I think you are doing a good and noble thing. Following this path will be demanding, and maybe quite difficult, but I believe and hope it will also be rewarding in many ways, including practical ones. However, getting the education you need to make the best use of your gifts through the rest of your life is also an important value. You should not participate in activities that you believe are morally wrong, but there may be times in your life when preparing yourself for your future takes priority over making a visible testimony. There will be time and need for that later, you can be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chinese may take over Mombasa port: Ouko</title>
<link>https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Chinese-may-take-Mombasa-Port--Ouko/1056-4902162-xfphu7z/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Chinese-may-take-Mombasa-Port--Ouko/1056-4902162-xfphu7z/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;author noprint&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/1951494/medRes/593420/-/12ubx6dz/-/General+Image.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By DAVID MWERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nation.co.ke/authors/1959272-4003520-view-asAuthor-jn4ko4z/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author-profile&quot;&gt;More by this Author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Kenya could lose the port of Mombasa to the Chinese government if Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) defaults in the payment of Sh227 billion owed to Exim Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The government borrowed the billions to construct the Mombasa-Nairobi standard gauge railway (SGR), against opposition that the project by China Roads and Bridges Corporation (CRBC), a Chinese State-owned company, could become a white elephant. The country's sovereignty is now at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A report by Auditor-General Edward Ouko states that the payment agreement substantively means the revenue of the Kenya Ports Authority would be used to clear the debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This is if the minimum volumes required for consignments are not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The audit shows that KPA’s revenue was Sh42.7 billion as at June 30, 2018, a 7.9 percent increase from the Sh39.6 billion recorded the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“Exim Bank would become a principal over KPA if KRC defaults in its obligations and the Chinese bank exercises power over the escrow account security,” states a management letter sent to the KPA, that Mr FT Kimani signed on behalf of Mr Ouko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The letter says, “KPA assets are exposed since the authority signed the agreement in which it has been referred to as a borrower under clause 17.5.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It adds, “Any proceedings against its assets by the lender would not be protected by sovereign immunity since the government waived the immunity on the KPA assets by signing the agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The auditor notes that the agreement is biased since any non-performance or dispute with the bank would be referred to arbitration in China, “whose fairness is resolving the disagreement may not be guaranteed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Mr Ouko accuses the KPA management of not disclosing the guarantee documents in its financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Despite the danger of losing the lucrative port, he recommends that the authority discloses pertinent issues and risks related to the guarantee in the statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The KPA is also required to confirm in the management representation letter that its assets are not a floating charge to the government of Kenya loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;On its Twitter handle, the Office of the Auditor-General appeared to distance itself from the report though it neither confirmed nor denied the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“Our attention has been drawn to reports that @OAG Kenya has released an audit report on @Kenya Ports for FY 2017/18. This is to clarify that the office has not released any such report,” the tweet read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A source at the auditor-general’s office, who did not want to go on record, said the issues raised were being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“The issues raised are not conclusive. They are a work in progress and will be dropped if they don’t respond satisfactorily,” the source said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The transfer, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, gave China control of the territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of rival India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It is a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“The case is one of the examples of China’s ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world and of its willingness to play hardball to collect,” says the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; of December 12, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In September 2018, Zambia lost its international airport to China over debt repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Artificial Intelligence Creates Realistic Pictures of People</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1059356&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; srcset=&quot;http://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702.png 900w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702-240x120.png 240w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702-360x180.png 360w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702-768x385.png 768w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23205526/AI-Face-1-e15456263742702-300x150.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day in the 2010s, it seems, brings another startling development in the field of artificial intelligence — a field widely written off not all that long ago as a dead end. But now AI looks just as alive as the people you see in these photographs, despite the fact that none of them have ever lived, and it's questionable whether we can even call the images that depict them &quot;photographs&quot; at all. All of them come, in fact, as products of a state-of-the-art &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network&quot;&gt;generative adversarial network&lt;/a&gt;, a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that pits multiple neural networks against each other in a kind of machine-learning match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-1059345 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23190541/AI-Face-3-e1545626386288.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These neural networks have, it seems, competed their way to generating images of fabricated human faces that genuine humans have trouble distinguishing from images of the real deal. Their architecture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf&quot;&gt;described in a paper by the Nvidia researchers who developed it&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis.&quot; What they've come up with, in other words, has made it not just more possible than ever to create fake faces, but made those faces more customizable than ever as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, the ability to create realistic AI faces raises troubling questions. (Not least of all, how long until stock photo models go out of work?)&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144356/ai-image-generation-fake-faces-people-nvidia-generative-adversarial-networks-gans&quot;&gt;writes James Vincent at The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Experts have been raising the alarm for the past couple of years about how AI fakery might impact society. These tools could be used for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/17/17247334/ai-fake-news-video-barack-obama-jordan-peele-buzzfeed&quot;&gt;misinformation and propaganda&lt;/a&gt; and might erode public trust in pictorial evidence, a trend that could damage the justice system as well as politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oc-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/kSLJriaOumA?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But still, &quot;you can’t doctor any image in any way you like with the same fidelity. There are also serious constraints when it comes to expertise and time. It took Nvidia’s researchers a week training their model on eight Tesla GPUs to create these faces.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1059377&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/12/23222604/aifaces5-e1545632775881.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;392&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though &quot;a running battle between AI fakery and image authentication for decades to come&quot; seems inevitable, the current ability of computers to create plausible faces certainly fascinates, especially when compared to their ability just four years ago, the hazy black-and-white fruits of which appear just above. Put that against the grid of faces at the top of the post, which shows how Nvidia's system can combine the features of the faces on one axis with the features on the other, and you'll get a sense of the technological acceleration involved. Such a process could well be used, for example, to give you a sense of what your future children might look like. But how long until it puts convincing visions of moving, speaking, even thinking human beings before our eyes?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ECMAScript modules in Node.js: the new plan</title>
<link>http://2ality.com/2018/12/nodejs-esm-phases.html</link>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;adbox&quot; data-reactid=&quot;37&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ad, please don’t block)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;40&quot; readability=&quot;19.75625400898&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status of ECMAScript module (ESM) support in Node.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html&quot;&gt;Experimental support for ESM&lt;/a&gt; was added in &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.5.0/&quot;&gt;Node.js 8.5.0 (2017-09-12)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, the Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee formed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/modules&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modules Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help design missing pieces and to guide the implementation towards its (non-experimental) release. The Modules Team is comprised of people from several different web development areas (frontend, backend, JS engines, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the Modules Team published the document “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/modules/blob/master/doc/plan-for-new-modules-implementation.md&quot;&gt;Plan for New Modules Implementation&lt;/a&gt;”. This blog post explains what it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-phases&quot;&gt;The phases  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of the Modules Team is split into &lt;em&gt;phases&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phase 1: Establish a “minimal kernel” – a foundational set of rules and features that is both minimal and as uncontroversial as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2 and later: Build on the kernel and tackle the design of more complicated features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimal kernel is a foundation for further work. The new design will replace the current experimental implementation, once it has similar capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;phase-1-minimal-kernel-of-esm-support-in-nodejs&quot;&gt;Phase 1: Minimal kernel of ESM support in Node.js  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;simplifying-module-specifiers&quot;&gt;Simplifying module specifiers  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the Modules Team is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/133&quot;&gt;browser equivalence&lt;/a&gt;”: Node.js should stay as close to browsers as possible. The kernel achieves that by making the resolution of &lt;em&gt;module specifiers&lt;/em&gt; (the URLs pointing to modules) simpler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each module specifier must end with a file name extension. That is:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No file name extension is added automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing a directory &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; is not supported (neither via &lt;code&gt;dir/index.mjs&lt;/code&gt; nor via the field &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES modules can import built-in Node.js modules (&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; etc.). They are currently the only exception to the previous rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, only &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; files are supported (check Phase 2 if you are interested in other file name extensions). That is, the following kinds of files cannot be imported via &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;: CommonJS modules, JSON files, native modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;bringing-important-commonjs-features-to-es-modules&quot;&gt;Bringing important CommonJS features to ES modules  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;URL of current module (CommonJS: &lt;code&gt;__filename&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;a href=&quot;http://2ality.com/2017/11/import-meta.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import.meta.url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamically importing ES modules (always possible via &lt;code&gt;require()&lt;/code&gt; in CommonJS): &lt;a href=&quot;http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;Interoperability:  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.92465753424658&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.91428571428571&quot;&gt;ES modules can import CommonJS modules via &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_createrequirefrompath_filename&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;createRequireFromPath()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This works &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/SMotaal/e73c12bd801d78a3108fa30ecd303676&quot;&gt;as follows&lt;/a&gt; (with plans to make it more concise, e.g. via a function &lt;code&gt;createRequireFromUrl()&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; {createRequireFromPath &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; createRequire} &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'module'&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; {fileURLToPath &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; fromPath} &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'url'&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; = createRequire(fromPath(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;.meta.url));

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; cjsModule = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'./cjs-module.js'&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CommonJS modules can import ES modules via &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;phase-2-and-later&quot;&gt;Phase 2 and later  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phase 2:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for “bare” specifiers such as &lt;code&gt;'lodash'&lt;/code&gt;. This will probably involve some kind of mapping from such specifiers to real paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for file name extensions other than &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt;. That includes support for ES modules in &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 3 will probably focus on module loaders with extension points that user code can hook into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-can-i-use-es-modules-in-nodejs&quot;&gt;When can I use ES modules in Node.js?  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behind a flag: &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html&quot;&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caveat: Not yet updated to Phase 1+ (as of Node.js 11.5.0).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No flag and based on Phase 1+: The goal of the Modules Team is to make this happen as soon as possible. Hopefully, it will be unflagged in Node.js 14 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/Release&quot;&gt;April 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and backported as far back as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;frequently-asked-questions&quot;&gt;Frequently asked questions  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the different file name extension &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every solution for distinguishing ESM and CJS has pros and cons. Using a different extension is a reasonable compromise (&lt;a href=&quot;http://2ality.com/2017/05/es-module-specifiers.html#why-new-extension&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should Node.js stay close to the browser?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That makes it possible to reuse code. For example, to write libraries that work both on browsers and on Node.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also makes it easier to switch between frontend and backend when coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why all these restrictions w.r.t. interoperability?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structure (static vs. dynamic) and loading process (async vs. sync) of ES modules and CommonJS modules are quite different. The restrictions keep things simple – considering the long-term future where ESM will be dominant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does all of this take so long?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many stakeholders and many different platforms involved (Node.js, npm, browsers, JS engines, TypeScript, TC39, etc.). If we end up with ES modules working well everywhere then it’s worth the wait, IMO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>ISO-8601, YYYY, yyyy, and why your year may be wrong</title>
<link>https://ericasadun.com/2018/12/25/iso-8601-yyyy-yyyy-and-why-your-year-may-be-wrong/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ericasadun.com/2018/12/25/iso-8601-yyyy-yyyy-and-why-your-year-may-be-wrong/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The end of the year is rolling around and it’s time to remind everyone about that &lt;code&gt;yyyy&lt;/code&gt; works the way you think it does and &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; does not. Here’s a quick example to start:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;6343&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://ericasadun.com/2018/12/25/iso-8601-yyyy-yyyy-and-why-your-year-may-be-wrong/screen-shot-2018-12-25-at-9-56-38-am/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?fit=1176%2C451&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1176,451&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-12-25 at 9.56.38 AM&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?fit=300%2C115&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?fit=980%2C376&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-6343&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?resize=980%2C376&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?w=1176&amp;amp;ssl=1 1176w, https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?resize=768%2C295&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?resize=1024%2C393&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ericasadun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-25-at-9.56.38-AM.png?resize=535%2C205&amp;amp;ssl=1 535w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you test a format quickly with the current date and get back the result you expect, does not mean you’ve constructed your date format correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, BJ Homer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bjhomer/status/1077684203913768960&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that you can just use “y”, as “yyyy” pads to 4 digits which doesn’t usually matter but isn’t always needed. Olivier Halligon &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aligatr/status/1077703226558959616&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;, further, that not all calendars use 4 digit years. “&lt;em&gt;For example the Japanese start a new era every time the emperor changes, resetting to year 1 in that era; we’re currently in year Heisei 30.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually seeing with “Dec 24, 2017” is the first day of the last full week of the preceding year. It doesn’t matter what numbers you plug into the month (“MM”) or day (“dd”). The presence of &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; in the date format without its expected supporting information reduces to “start of year, go back one week, report the first day”. (I’ll explain this more in just a little bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples, which you can check from the command line using the &lt;code&gt;cal&lt;/code&gt; utility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Apple’s 2014-era &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DataFormatting/Articles/dfDateFormatting10_4.html&quot;&gt;date formatting guide&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common mistake is to use &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;yyyy&lt;/code&gt; specifies the calendar year whereas &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; specifies the year (of “Week of Year”), used in the ISO year-week calendar. In most cases, &lt;code&gt;yyyy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; yield the same number, however they may be different. &lt;strong&gt;Typically you should use the calendar year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode.org’s Unicode Technical Standard #35, &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-10.html#Date_Format_Patterns&quot;&gt;Date Format Patterns&lt;/a&gt; goes into a little more depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[“Y” is] Year (&lt;strong&gt;in “Week of Year” based calendars&lt;/strong&gt;). This year designation is used in ISO year-week calendar as defined by ISO 8601, but can be used in non-Gregorian based calendar systems where week date processing is desired. &lt;strong&gt;May not always be the same value as calendar year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO 8601 uses a 4-digit year (&lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt;) for “week of year” calendars from 0000 to 9999. If you’re into trivia, the years before 1583 are technically excluded except by special agreement between sending and receiving parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you’re going to use &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; formats, you’ll want to use additional format elements that support “week of year” date construction. For example, consider the calendar for this upcoming January, which starts on Tuesday the 1st:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    January 2019      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
       1  2  3  4  5  
 6  7  8  9 10 11 12  
13 14 15 16 17 18 19  
20 21 22 23 24 25 26  
27 28 29 30 31
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, January first can be considered as the first week of 2019 &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the 53rd week of 2018, as the weeks overlap in the middle. Using &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; (the numeric day of the week) and &lt;code&gt;ww&lt;/code&gt; (the ordinal week to count from), you can represent both dates correctly using the oddball &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; formatting token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are examples that use the week-of-year approach counting from both 2018 and 2019:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this, when you use &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt; and do not supply an ordinal week or day, they both default to zero, which is why you get the behavior of the zeroth week (that is, the week before the first week) on the zeroth day (also, the first day of that week) for that calendar year, which is the week before the first week that overlaps the stated year. This explains the results of all those otherwise random late-December dates from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO 8601 should be updated in a few months, with a release somewhere around February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, the first part revises the current standard and the second expands it. The only freely accessible human-viewable material I could find were the five-page TOC previews for 8601-1 and 8601-2.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>The end of the year is rolling around and it’s time to remind everyone about that yyyy works the way you think it does and YYYY does not. Here’s a quick example to start: Just because y…</og:description>
