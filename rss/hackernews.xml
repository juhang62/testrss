<title>Beating C with one line of Brainfuck</title>
<link>https://kiwec.net/blog/posts/beating-c-with-brainfuck/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kiwec.net/blog/posts/beating-c-with-brainfuck/</guid>
<description>&lt;aside/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrispenner.ca/posts/wc&quot;&gt;“faster than wc”&lt;/a&gt; blogposts, I decided to end this fad once and for all, using the best language ever created : &lt;strong&gt;Brainfuck&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-brainfuck&quot; data-lang=&quot;brainfuck&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;+&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-----------&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;----------------------&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;+&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]][&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;++++++++++&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;++++++++&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;++++++&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;++++++++&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;++++++&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;++++++++++&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, obviously, that’s not very readable. We just needed to put that in for the sweet clickbait ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the actual code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-brainfuck&quot; data-lang=&quot;brainfuck&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  VARIABLES (in cell order) :
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      total = 0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt; was_letter = 0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt; input &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt; tmp0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;while the input isn't EOF : we count words &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;----------&lt;span&gt; if input is not a newline &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;----------------------&lt;span&gt; if input is not a space &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&lt;span&gt;         tmp0 = 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;+&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt; if not was_letter increment total
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;       clear was_letter
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; move tmp0 to was_letter
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; take input again
&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;print the total (nothing new)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;++++++++++&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;++++++++&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;++++++&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;+&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;++++++++&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;++++++&amp;gt;-&lt;span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;++++++++++&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the maximum performance out of it, I choose to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zesterer/funkicrab&quot;&gt;funkicrab&lt;/a&gt;, which totally doesn’t compile to C (I used clang with &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt;, if you are wondering). Since cells need to be 32-bit for counting more than 255 words, you’ll also need to replace the few occurrences of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how fast can it run ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cat words.txt | time wc -w
13018291
0.52 user
0.01 system
0:00.55 elapsed

$ cat words.txt | time ./bfwc
13018291
0.50 user
0.02 system
0:00.54 elapsed
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like we won a hundredth of a second counting the number of words in a 85 Megabyte file. Which I do all day, every day, so I’m now relaxing by thinking about all the free time I gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, of course not, this was a complete waste of time. Hope you enjoyed it nonetheless :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tell HN: Google should drop Quora from search results</title>

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;21623882&quot; readability=&quot;4.618320610687&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora and Pinterest are the worst parts of Google results. Also Google Images has been ruined. Used to be you could View Image and get the source image but now Google images hijacks that too. I gotta say I hate whoever decided that was ok. Do what I mean. Actually come to think of it I think this was due to copyright infringement case against Google. Stupid.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;21624243&quot; readability=&quot;8.592&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; class=&quot;votelinks&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;9.0216&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;17.744610281924&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;IIRC this was due to a lost court case:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Almost two years ago, Getty Images filed antitrust charges against Google in the EU, taking issue with the company's image scraping techniques to display image search results. Earlier this week, Google and Getty Images announced a partnership and Getty withdrew its charges against Google. Changes like the removal of direct image links were apparently part of the agreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/internet-rages-after-google-removes-view-image-button-bowing-to-getty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/internet-rages-after...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, the browser feature right click -&amp;gt; &quot;View Image&quot; still works for me on Firefox, as a replacement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;21623928&quot; readability=&quot;1.8351063829787&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For years now I have used &quot;-pinterest&quot; on every regular search term I utilize (I bake that into any Google bookmark). Would applaud the removal of Pinterest from search results.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.037900874636&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Google has given up on improving search, much like Microsoft did with IE6 when it became the dominant player. Only real competition would force them to start improving again.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Here is my own userscript that removes any matching URL portions from Google search. It does it in a fancy way with stylesheets so that you never see the Quora, etc results even temporarily before they're removed. It also fixes Google Images to link directly to images again, removes all the tracking URL obfuscations, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.byuu.org/google&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://code.byuu.org/google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Should be more robust than the other alternatives listed, but if not, let me know. I'm always up for improving it more. Contributions also welcome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I only use the script on my desktop, and so I've never seen an AMP result. I'd need to be able to use the 'inspect element' developer tool on mobile I suppose in order to see how to filter them. Not even sure the script works on mobile though.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is the better option, since it does not hide sites which simply contain the word &quot;pinterest&quot;, but are not pinterest.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;No the spammy results are when I search for something on google, it gives me a Pinterest link that matches my search term exactly, the link has absolutely nothing to do with what I was actually searching for and if you click onto it, you're met with a page full of random Pinterest crap for about 3 seconds before it busts out a signup wall in your face and to top it off it'll take you at least 5 clicks of the back button to actually get off the page. I find it happens a lot searching for tutorials for things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;ETA: to address the original question, I find quora annoying, but a lot less than Pinterest. I actually do get decent results when I can view a page. It just seems to be random whether it throws an account wall up or not. I find copying and pasting a link to a related question into a new tab will sometimes work if I close the original tab first, but not always.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is not as blatant as it was before, but I can't spend more than 10 seconds or click on anything without getting it. Can't even enlarge the picture or visit the original website.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The spammy results problem is super easy to solve from Pinterest's side. Just make pages full of images non-indexable and provide simple pages with one single image and there will be no more spammy results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;By &quot;easy&quot; I mean technically. Pinterest is a scummy company and I doubt they'd lift a finger to make things better for the web and its users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If we're, the customers that'd sooner leave a site than capitulate to unreasonable demands, known of and written off then so be it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Instead of fixing the structure of their goddamn website, they wanted Google to give them special treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not sure if they are playing with this on a global scale or if my ublock and similar plugins affect it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The times when I could not see what I had expected - just an overlay nag screen, I certainly wish they were not in the results. Other times I found the curated visual content of pinterest to be better then google results or google image search.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I had thought the big G algo already punished for showing full content to the crawler but blocked content to average web browser.. however I had the feeling some time ago that some manual tweaking on google's side and perhaps pin's side started affecting how all that was working together or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes, dislike that one too, a grid of tiny images which if you click on them are still tiny and try to make you sign up&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And many Google hits for Pinterest images land you on pages with dozens or hundreds of images, making it extremely difficult to find the actual image you searched for, and, from there, to find the original source of the image. The whole process seems designed to provide as little attribution to the original author of the image as possible.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c9c&quot;&gt;Why? I once found (for purely personal use) a unique picture which was exactly what I needed this way and that played a valuable role in my life.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Because often the image that was indexed was in the related/other area of the page and is not on the page when you click on the link. Ever since Google removed the direct link to image feature from the search results page anything from pinterest.com is basically SEO spam.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c73&quot;&gt;Every time I've been affected I could find the image in a couple of seconds of scrolling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c73&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Ever since Google removed the direct link to image feature from the search results page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c73&quot;&gt;It's easy to add it back. Most of the people here (me included) use ad blockers, downloaders and stuff like probably violating the Google user agreement, they should not have any problem installing a small userscript/extension to forget about this problem as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora is full of it, and so is LinkedIn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A shill asks &quot;a question,&quot; followed by all these &quot;answers,&quot; recommending a particular site, product or technique (that has a backer).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have had to leave quite a number of forums, because they became completely taken over by Asian spammers; doing exactly this. They rendered the groups useless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;TBH: I did fall for it the first time I encountered it. It's a fairly effective technique, if done right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Though I'll say this -- it's hard to optimize Quora's feed, but once you do that by carefully curating the topics and the people to follow, Quora can be an incredible source of super insightful answers on niche topics. But it does take a lot of work, which is a barrier to many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Their feed display mechanism needs a lot of work imo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, in the past year something seems to have changed. Now I get really spammy suggestions, and there is rarely new content on my feed. I get the same suggestions for days.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don’t doubt that the good content is there. I think their algorithms just changed and now I don’t see it anymore. Not willing to put in the effort to figure out how to get an interesting feed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After more than two weeks of the feed showing me the exact same questions and answers every day with only 1-2 new ones inbetween I stopped using it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And at that point they had changed parts of the site so much I couldn't figure out how to subscribe to new topics because all of them were replaced by user-created topics/groups like on Facebook(at least that's how I understood it).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A lot of Quora spammers will play the long game. Some of them will take the time to get moderately familiar with a subject, write some organic answers, gain some karma on the site, then start shilling. It's an interesting incentive structure, but ultimately most answers on the site end up being the mediocre filler by spammers trying to build their accounts.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have not run into this kind of spam on SO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are a lot of &quot;Kool Aid&quot; threads, where folks get heavily invested in a technique or pattern, but those are legit, if somewhat tiresome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also SO is very specific and narrow (programming questions only), while Quora is very broad, so it's probably harder to moderate effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;12.917512690355&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora back in 2011 was magical. I spent hours reading answers by some incredible people and it influenced a lot of my thinking back then. Unfortunately they kept raising money they didn't need and the VC treadmill turned the site into a wasteland.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are still gems of knowledge but the experience is ruined. Overbearing content moderation won't let you edit your own question. Credits system was removed and instead Quora now pays people to post useless questions. They ignored every tool and feature that writers asked for. The mobile site won't let you read more than half an answer before forcing the app. Spammers are never stopped and voting rings have taken over most popular questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's a sad case of a site that's successful despite the execution, not because of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora answers are astonishingly bad. People with fake credentials saying nonsensical things. I really hope people realize how bad it is, but I suspect that because its something people inherently don't know the answer to, they don't understand just how bad it is. Most people stop looking after they get their answer. Most people aren't going to keep looking after they've found their answer to find a primary, reliable source.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;48.884105960265&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I entirely agree.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora and Pinterest are particularly routine spam sites in my search results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They rank just below word reference site spam, like dictionaries, thesauruses, or translation dictionaries (sites which I do benefit occasionally from), and below Wikipedia mirrors (which I feel has become so bad that I can't even get legitimate results talking about the problem itself! Try searching something like: &lt;em&gt;search results spam wikipedia mirror &quot;revolvy&quot; &quot;wikiwand&quot;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But for me, the worst (and most obvious!) offenders by far are &quot;pronunciation guide&quot; spam sites. Just a few examples:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  howtopronounce.com
  howtopronounce.co.in
  pronouncekiwi.com
  pronouncenames.com
  pronunciationof.com
  rightpronunciation.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;plus the scourge of 16-second YouTube videos on channels with names like Pronunciation Guide or Emma Saying.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(If you search for something like &lt;em&gt;&quot;Deidesheimer pronunciation&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;pronounce Canynge&quot;&lt;/em&gt; on Google, the vast majority of results will be those spam sites, plus maybe an ancient forum thread from 2004 that veered off topic before anyone even tried to give a serious yet uninformed answer.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;These ad-infested spam sites purport to teach you how to pronounce an unfamiliar name or tricky word (an important and underappreciated service that many people use!). But usually they merely contain computer-generated bullshit, as if fed directly into all available text-to-speech algorithms. Even the ostensibly human-generated recordings and sites are often flagrantly wrong, unsourced, and untrustworthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are a few legitimate sites (such as Forvo, Youglish, etc.), but too often they are woefully incomplete (by nature of their being crowdsourced). Forvo even contributes to the spam with &quot;do you know how to pronounce this word?&quot; false positives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I once blocked all of the spam sites when the domain-blocking feature you mentioned was built into Google Search; then had to do it once again when I needed a browser add-on to replace the removed feature (which naturally only worked on desktop); and recently I was astonished to find that the add-on also stopped working! The spam never ends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I know, right? How hard would it be for someone to make a wiki-style site with UGC, a reputation system (I speak this language natively and vouch / do not vouch for this content), a tracker for trending words, fun articles for Llanfairpwllgwyngyll and the like? The Web I used to know seems to be gone or at least in steep decline, supplanted by garbage like this.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Loading a few pages from browsing history, I don't see any walled garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;LinkedIn results on the other hand... Google/DDG clearly didn't index the login page, so LinkedIn apparently shows certain content to the crawler that they aren't showing to the user, trying to get ranked higher for that query than the login page would be. Not sure how that isn't seen as fraudulent from the search engine's perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My experience is the same. When I do get Quora, I do not have to sign up, and it’s usually valuable. I would add that the presence of a Quora result at the top of search-engine results usually indicates that my query is freaking arcane and specific, and Google is doing its best to show me _something_. In other words, it’s not as though Quora results are taking slots away from better results.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the beginning the core demographics was Sillicon Valley startup scene. It felt like a small community of smart and interesting people (my favourites were Yishan Wong and Rory Young). At one point, the site got very popular in India for whatever reason and there was an influx of low quality answers. I left some time after that. There was also a trend of people using the site to promote their products, which was explicitly allowed by Quora AFAIK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Right now, it seems that the site is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more popular in countries like India or Nepal than in the US: &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=quora&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.855334538879&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Agreed, early Quora was interesting, it had a buzz and you got answers from people you wouldn't expect.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Now, it's spammy. Some of the questions are ridiculous, with easily Googleable answers, but makes sense if it's spammers using Q&amp;amp;As to raise profiles of people and services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora now also appears desperate. I occasionally answered questions but doing so would trigger something like three emails a day asking me to answer another question. That level of desperation is offputting, so I just unsubscribed and as a result don't answer any more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Agreed, Quora answers these days consist of mostly advertisements and copies of (often stolen) blog posts. I personally try to avoid the platform whenever I can.&lt;/span&gt;

I remember reading some quality content on the platform. Then &quot;the masses&quot; started answering questions just to rack up upvotes (or whatever Quora was calling it). Imagine Instagram, but instead of uploading pictures of yourself you copy-paste someone else's content in an attempt to answer a question you do not know much about.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Like I was trying to find lyrics for a song today, and first 5 sites were showing author and song name, but the page said &quot;we don't have lyrics now, you could be the one who will write them&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;18.893497757848&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As a non-US based user, I uninstalled Amazon's iOS app yesterday because of this exact behaviour. Often a US-only deal will get posted on a local forum here in New Zealand. The link for the deal will go to the Amazon US store. If you click that link without the app, you are taken straight to the listing where you can review the price, shipping options etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;However, if you have the iOS app installed, it opens the app when you click the link, loops twice (never loads the listing) and lands you on the Amazon US homepage. I've tried everything to stop this behaviour (changing regions, loading in logged out state etc), but to no avail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It finally frustrated me so much yesterday (especially in the lead up to black friday) that I outright deleted the app to stop those links being captured by the native application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It feels so liberating to click a link and get the desired result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My experience as a user of the Amazon iOS app is that the developers deeply care about these kinds of quality issues. I have seen the looping behavior before in other contexts; I reported it, and it was eventually fixed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In the app there is a customer service link in the hamburger menu, with a “contact us” option if you’re willing to spend a couple of minutes telling them about your problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Because I strongly prefer unmoderated, marketing-free opinionated answers based on personal experience/knowledge and expressed in a concise manner to raw web data. I don't even mind googling some details to come up with a clean answer for the others. That's a kind of community I'd love to participate in.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In fact, even when somebody submits a completely just-google-it question you can answer comprehensively by just looking at Wikipedia or the first ling in the search results or something everybody is supposed to know it doesn't irritate me, whenever I can provide a useful answer to somebody's question it floods my brain with dopamine and serotonin so an easy question is just an opportunity to get the reward easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Whatever (from a sophisticated scientific question to a rhetoric question/joke) I would ask on Aardvark I would almost immediately receive an interesting answer (better than those you usually find on Quora) to and some more answers during the following hours. That felt so cool. Then my imagination has ran out of questions and then Aardvrk got terminated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Or they insist on sending redundant notifications. Or there's a mysterious number and no way to see that actual notifications.

My observation is that each link in the digest actually points to an answer of a particular question. When you click on it, it looks like you arrive at the home page, but the page will show &quot;From Your Digest&quot; at the top so you can actually read the answer. You can then click on the question to read all the answers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's annoying because if you open a bunch of these links in the background, you would not be happy if your browser crashes, because then you lose all the links.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Forbes is also effectively full of opinion hit pieces of low value (although these don’t seem to be paywalled). These also show up in a lot of Google searches and likewise get up-voted here quite a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The question is, should google actively try to trim this content, and if so where should it end?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;22.866898148148&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Look, as a &lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt; yes Quora sucks (and so does Pinterest, mentioned many times here in the comments).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But individual &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt; on Quora (and images on Pinterest) may very well be the only place what I'm looking for exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing I want is for Google to stop indexing and showing their content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Seriously -- there's zero user benefit to hiding it. It's easy to identify Quora/Pinterest in search results and choose to click or not based on your own preferences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And at least with Quora, I never have to log in to view all the answers if I come from Google. It only asks me to log in when I try to click through to a second question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Finally, the last thing I want is Google de-ranking results that are behind any kind of login and/or paywall. Because that would mean de-ranking most news sites I use, which would be a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; direction to move in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Adding a feature for an end user to say restrict a search in some manner might be nice, but the point, at least in my opinion, of a web search engine is to find any and all matching content on the web. If some of that is paid or otherwise blocked content it’s still doing its job properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This was nondiscriminatory, and I think it was a great policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They threatened to delist EE because of their deceptive SEO (including answers in search results, but requiring accounts when going to their page from Google). Google insisted the actual answers be listed. Deceptive search results made their service worse. Arguably Quora, Pinterest, et. al. are doing the same.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Maybe a flag for the pages that require accounts would be in order.

There is no truly objective way to do this. The closest you can get is to define &quot;objective&quot; the way pollsters do, as a way of understanding average opinions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What does &quot;average&quot; mean here, though? Do you rank restricted sites higher if more people have accounts?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They could probably do a better job if they knew what you're subscribed to. For example, people with a Quora account or Washington Post subscription should get that ranked higher. But this would mean telling Google more about you, which seems to be unpopular around here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If I create a site that serves a world of unique, useful content to Google, but locks out everyone else completely, do you want that content indexed? Is it really on the web? The search result only serves to annoy you into thinking there's anything to find.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is where the early search engines started out at. Turns out there is a LOT of content found for many searches, and the real value to most people is in finding _relevant_ content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The devil is in the detail of how do you define relevance? This is why I think it is so important to have multiple search engine choices, each with their own algorithms and different sets of user options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I feel at least a little weird about giving crawlers a carte blanche to paid content. Creating relevant pages, showing them to the crawler to get ranked higher, and then not showing them to the user but requiring something in return first... I don't know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I do see your point: it would be good to have everything indexed, even paid content or content available only in certain regions or whatever, just so you know what your options are if you're willing to pay for it. But then I think there should be a button to hide those results (either opt-in or opt-out, to show paid content).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As it is, it just weirds me out to show the crawler different content than you show the user and not be seen as fraudulent and get delisted altogether.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Agreed, but Google does have UX Signals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But plenty of times I see a question on Quora and it sparks an idea or leads to questions of my own that I then seek answers for independently.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.916158536585&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora used to have a system which rewarded good answers. Now, they pay people to ask popular questions. In the private Top Writers group (I left shortly after this change) it was predicted that this is result in a dearth of garbage questions: template &quot;what is X times Y?&quot;, nonsense &quot;what if&quot; questions, etc. And sure enough, it came to pass.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora made a conscious choice to trade quality answers for more questions (of any quality). They surely saw in advance what the site would become and did it anyway. It used to be a place where you could read thoughtful replies from intelligent people, and it's become a spiritual successor to Yahoo Answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Agreed, writers are what make the site and Quora has routinely ignored their requests and warnings. I'm constantly surprised at how inept their decisions are considering the team behind it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And when I have occasionally tested Google to compare results, I also noticed a rapid decline in the relevant results at Google. So much that I can hardly recognize that search engine any longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Google does not need to drop Quora from its search results, Quora itself is already on the way to irrelevancy.

A perfect example of a niche but strong product ditching its target audience in order to pursue popularity.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But there are many more websites that should be &quot;removed&quot;, instagram, pinterest (basically everything that requires a log-in). Also, all reposts should be removed, there are so many sites reposting SO or mailing list content with weird UI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder if this is a case of Quora being so massive that this post is rallying the vocal minority, which seems large only because everyone happy with Quora is staying silent.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Personally, I get a lot of value from Quora answers. There have been specific cases where the knowledge I needed was only found on Quora. For example, how to access Library Genesis when their main domain was down. Another interesting one was “What’s the net worth of Sam Altman?” The answers seemed pretty reasonable, and I like that speculative questions are allowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don’t remember creating a Quora account, but even if I haven’t, I think creating one is an ok price to pay. It keeps the site running.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quora actually points to a flaw of algo only search engine rankings - do a lot of people link to it? Is it a lot of keyword intense content? Yep and Yep!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But the important - is it actually useful, relevant information - well that's secondary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also there’s the issue of many of Quora’s answers being generated by sales and marketing content purveyors.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The worst is when you expect Google to display a stack overflow question or a Github issue in response to your query, but instead what you get is a Quora answer. You already know that though the question matches (almost) your exact query, the answer is going to be badly formatted and useless.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are a number of sites that are mostly useless in Google results. Perhaps a larger issue is that any company that solicits public data input be required to sign an ironclad agreement with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; that my content is under my copyright and if they ever try to monetize my content they share any revenues with me. Otherwise they get class-action sued into oblivion.&lt;/span&gt;

What you demand is already the case: content you create is copyrighted by you and can't be relicensed by anyone else without your permission. All without any agreements at all!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Now, it would be tyrannical not to give you any way to transfer rights to your creative output. So some publishers do allow you to agree to a Terms And Conditions waiving certain of these rights, or transferring them to said publishers. It goes without saying that no one would ever compel you to agree to such conditions, but some publishers might not agree to publish your work without such an agreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not sure how you are expecting sites that are driven by the userbase to exist since your phrasing sounds like you believe providing all of the infrastructure, management and marketing for information isn't enough to morally receive payment for that information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree. If website presents one content to Google and another to anonymous user, it's scam. Actually Google is known to punish that behaviour and ban those websites. Probably Quora is considered too big to fail.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Personally I'd rather they not remove any search results, because I can scroll past or use &quot;-site:quora.com&quot; if I don't want to see those specific ones. Google's search results have already gotten bad enough as it is without them doing any more &quot;algorithmic censoring&quot;, if they modify their algorithms to exclude/derank Quora they risk removing even more possibly better results too.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm torn. A lot of my searches are filled with Quora spam, but I also have found some extremely deep, well written answers on esoteric topics there.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c5a&quot;&gt;Seriously though, I know this'll be unpopular but Google already tracks User Experience Signals to identify sites whose answers are difficult to get to. If Quora should be identified &amp;amp; ranked lower, that's totally a Google problem, but dropping entire companies &amp;amp; making it Google's role to monitor sites &amp;amp; decide which logins are &quot;walled&quot; and which are just UX is a terrible idea (do you trust Google to get it right every time?).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If a website didn't require an account initially it should not require it years after it's founded, that's just nonsense and it will drive people away to other alternative websites giving the same service without requiring registration.&lt;/span&gt;

It would be cool if there were an extension that was like that but more advanced; I'm thinking the uBlock Origin for filtering search results that could work for both Google and DuckDuckGo based on premade block lists.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;EDIT: It looks like Google took down their extension. &lt;em&gt;boo they suck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree with you. A domain filter would be the best as there are other sites in addition to Quora that provides junk content. For example, for all health type of search theres a website named healthline.com which appears with 2-3 of the top results. I wish I could block it somehow.&lt;/span&gt;

E.g. let the SPLC curate a list, the NRA curates another list, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Meta-weights would also be useful, users could subscribe to the SPLC list but weight it by 1.5, weight the NRA list by -1, etc., whatever works for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree they should drop quora results, but for a different reason.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;14.903846153846&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes, but adding a list of sites to remove to every single query you ever type... search engines should just remove bad sites (note: I am actually &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; removing Quora, this is just about the general case). Also, there is a maximum input length for some reason, so that might not actually work.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(&quot;For some reason&quot; -- to prevent monster queries of course, but I mean, removing sites doesn't cost much computational power at all. With some literal quotes and AND/OR operators you can create short queries on which it basically times out after 5 seconds and only returns a few dozen results that it found so far, and when you reload the page, there are suddenly a lot more results. So it shouldn't be limiting input length but complexity, which it already does by timing out.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I actually didn’t know that. My first thought was a browser add on that allows the user to blacklist domains they’d rather not see results and construct a query based upon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Seems like that moot if a sufficiently long list would result in sites being left off and end up in queries anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Past couple of years I have wondered how 'chat iw dot us' has been a top result for 'sex chat' search, and they run google ads this whole time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;that one and 'the porn dude' in those results, which doesn't have a chat system - they way the algo is working in those. Of course I am a bit biased, it's sad to me that little content wins in that vertical - lots of content is penalized for something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Leaked documents detail for the first time China's systematic brainwashing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in a network of high-security prison camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has consistently claimed the camps in the far western Xinjiang region offer voluntary education and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But official documents, seen by BBC Panorama, show how inmates are locked up, indoctrinated and punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's UK ambassador dismissed the documents as fake news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leak was made to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)&lt;/a&gt;, which has worked with 17 media partners, including BBC Panorama and The Guardian newspaper in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation has found new evidence which undermines Beijing's claim that the detention camps, which have been built across Xinjiang in the past three years, are for voluntary re-education purposes to counter extremism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47157111&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaked Chinese government documents, which the ICIJ have labelled &quot;The China Cables&quot;, include a nine-page memo sent out in 2017 by Zhu Hailun, then deputy-secretary of Xinjiang's Communist Party and the region's top security official, to those who run the camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instructions make it clear that the camps should be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline, punishments and no escapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled: &quot;The students should have a fixed bed position, fixed queue position, fixed classroom seat, and fixed station during skills work, and it is strictly forbidden for this to be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Implement behavioural norms and discipline requirements for getting up, roll call, washing, going to the toilet, organising and housekeeping, eating, studying, sleeping, closing the door and so forth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other documents confirm the extraordinary scale of the detentions. One reveals that 15,000 people from southern Xinjiang were sent to the camps over the course of just one week in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said the leaked memo should be used by prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is an actionable piece of evidence, documenting a gross human rights violation,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it's fair to describe everyone being detained as being subject at least to psychological torture, because they literally don't know how long they're going to be there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;The BBC visited the camps earlier this year. The Chinese government says they are for voluntary re-education&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo details how detainees will only be released when they can demonstrate they have transformed their behaviour, beliefs and language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past activity,&quot; it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For those who harbour vague understandings, negative attitudes or even feelings of resistance… carry out education transformation to ensure that results are achieved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Emmerson QC, a leading human rights lawyer and an adviser to the World Uighur Congress, said the camps were trying to change people's identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is very difficult to view that as anything other than a mass brainwashing scheme designed and directed at an entire ethnic community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a total transformation that is designed specifically to wipe the Muslim Uighurs of Xinjiang as a separate cultural group off the face of the Earth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;China's hidden camps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detainees are awarded points for their &quot;ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline&quot;, the memo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punishment-and-reward system helps determine whether inmates are allowed contact with family and when they are released. They are only considered for release once four Communist Party committees have seen evidence they have been transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaked documents also reveal how the Chinese government uses mass surveillance and a predictive-policing programme that analyses personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One document shows how the system flagged 1.8m people simply because they had a data sharing app called Zapya on their phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorities then ordered the investigation of 40,557 of them &quot;one by one&quot;. The document says &quot;if it is not possible to eliminate suspicion&quot; they should be sent for &quot;concentrated training&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents include explicit directives to arrest Uighurs with foreign citizenship and to track Uighurs living abroad. They suggest that China's embassies and consulates are involved in the global dragnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said the measures had safeguarded local people and there had not been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The region now enjoys social stability and unity among ethnic groups. People there are living a happy life with a much stronger sense of fulfilment and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In total disregard of the facts, some people in the West have been fiercely slandering and smearing China over Xinjiang in an attempt to create an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs, disrupt China's counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang and thwart China's steady development.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Today’s Top Tech Skills</title>
<link>https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/11/19/todays-top-tech-skills/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/11/19/todays-top-tech-skills/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first of four parts of the Indeed Tech Skills Explorer&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;an interactive look at which tech skills are in demand and for which tech jobs. For these reports, we searched for more than 500 tech skills in US postings for tech jobs on Indeed.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL and Java are the top two tech skills employers want, according to millions of US job postings on Indeed.com between 2014 and 2019. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python is the third most common skill, posting strong growth driven partly by data science jobs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS), at number six, has had even more spectacular growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills are everything in the tech world. But which skills exactly? What are the tech skills most in demand today? Looking at the millions of US tech jobs posted on Indeed.com over the past five years offers some answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the table below shows, of all the tech skills employers want, SQL came out on top, appearing in 22% of tech job postings in the year ending September 2019. Though it led the pack, SQL’s dominance is fading. Its percentage of appearances in all tech jobs postings fell 7% in the five years ended in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java was a close second, showing up in 21%. Python was number three, listed in 18% of job postings and standing out for remarkable growth since 2014. Some of the surge in Python’s popularity reflects a new mix of jobs, including several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/01/17/data-scientist-job-outlook/&quot;&gt;growing robustly&lt;/a&gt;, like data scientist and data engineer. Linux was number four and JavaScript, which has grown steadily, came in fifth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top_10_tech_skills_chart_corrected_Nov-16-19-1-1024x582.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13460&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top_10_tech_skills_chart_corrected_Nov-16-19-1-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top_10_tech_skills_chart_corrected_Nov-16-19-1-300x170.png 300w, https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top_10_tech_skills_chart_corrected_Nov-16-19-1-768x436.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another notable story is the spectacular rise of number six, Amazon Web Services, or AWS for short. Its share in tech job postings skyrocketed more than fivefold from 2014 to 2019. Growth in demand for AWS skills strongly signals the ever-greater importance of cloud computing platforms and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top 10 tech skills were several long-established programming languages with modest or flat growth: C++, C, and C#. In tenth place was .NET, which declined in share 15% over the five-year period. Beyond the top ten, Oracle, Unix, and HTML shares of tech job postings dropped 38%, 33%, and 17% respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tech_skills_table1_corrected_Nov-16-19-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13461&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tech_skills_table1_corrected_Nov-16-19-1.png 653w, https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tech_skills_table1_corrected_Nov-16-19-1-300x279.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind Python and AWS’s Incredible Growth: Changing Tech Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2014, Python was an also-ran, at number 15 among tech skill on Indeed.com. Five years later, Python had jumped to third place and its share had increased 123%. The rise of AWS was even more stunning — up 418% over the same period, from 39th place to number six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a story behind this soaring popularity. Of course, software engineers and full stack developers, to name two common tech job titles, increasingly use Python. And those same workers use AWS a lot too. But a big reason behind the exceptional growth of Python and AWS is that the underlying tech job mix is changing in ways that favor these programming languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Tech skills can rise or fall for two reasons. One, more tech jobs require that skill or, two, tech jobs that disproportionately use that skill increase or decrease more than tech jobs overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary gains of Python and AWS have been driven by the second factor. In particular, as noted in previous posts, tech jobs that disproportionately use Python, like data scientist and data engineer are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/01/17/data-scientist-job-outlook/&quot;&gt;booming&lt;/a&gt;. AWS’s explosive growth is not as closely tied to the rise of data scientist positions. Instead, tech jobs like full stack developer and development operations (“DevOps”) engineer have fueled its rise. The changing job mix — exemplified by the growth of data scientist and full stack developer positions — has fueled the rise of skills like Python and AWS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s top tech skill is SQL, followed by Java, with Python hot on their heels. JavaScript and especially AWS have grown strongly too. The explosion of data science jobs has been a major contributor to Python’s rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A list of over 500 tech skill terms was used to query the job descriptions of postings on Indeed.com between September 2014 and September 2019. Only US English language postings having one of these tech job titles were considered. One cautionary note though: Multiple skills can appear in the same job description and some terms can appear in multiple distinct skills, like “SQL” and “SQL server.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of a changing job mix, we decomposed the change in a skill into two components: skill saturation within jobs (e.g., more postings in a given job title listing Python) and the changing job mix (proportionally more tech postings in jobs that use Python, like data scientist). Holding constant the job mix at the September 2014 level — when the data scientist share of all tech jobs was about a third of what it is now —- shows how the “adjusted” Python trend evolved over time. We repeated this process for AWS and all tech skills studied. Python and AWS stood out for noticeable gaps between their true skill shares and their shares adjusted for the job-mix effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TikTok: Cheerfulness and censorship</title>
<link>https://netzpolitik.org/2019/cheerfulness-and-censorship/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://netzpolitik.org/2019/cheerfulness-and-censorship/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;No app has been downloaded as often as TikTok in the past year. The video sharing platform is growing rapidly. In November 2019, TikTok broke the 1 billion-user barrier – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/dd7234e8-fcb9-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229&quot;&gt;faster than any other social network ever before&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/&quot;&gt;video app and its culture are currently so popular&lt;/a&gt; with children and young people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Tagesschau-jetzt-auch-auf-TikTok-4592727.html&quot;&gt;that even the Tagesschau&lt;/a&gt; (the major German public TV News programme) now has its own account there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, research by netzpolitik.org shows that TikTok is currently able to suppress videos of political protests and demonstrations and additionally determine which content is visible, through a variety of means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exclusive insight into content moderation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this research, netzpolitik.org spoke to a source at TikTok, looked at moderation criteria and communications, and experimented with specially created accounts to see how well videos with China-critical content are visible on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikToks moderation rules, of which netzpolitik.org was able to see different versions, are remarkably thin and widely interpretable – even for the moderators themselves. The strategy, however, is clear: certain content is given the widest possible reach, while others are systematically suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful platform belongs to the Chinese technology company ByteDance. Already in September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing&quot;&gt;the Guardian reported on leaked documents that detailed&lt;/a&gt; how TikTok censored political statements on the Tiananmen massacre or the independence of Tibet. The protests in Hong Kong, which are currently attracting worldwide media attention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/&quot;&gt;are virtually invisible on TikTok between selfies and singalongs&lt;/a&gt;, even though the app is available in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beijing moderates at night&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German-language videos on TikTok are moderated from three locations, reports the source: Berlin, Barcelona and Beijing. At the German location, the leadership is Chinese. Work is carried out in 8-hour shifts, during which around 1,000 tickets have to be processed. At just under half a minute per ticket, this is very little time for video content. Wages differ widely, and pressure on individual moderators is high, with mood in the team being „toxic“, the source reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the source, moderation takes place in three review stages. The first review already takes place in Barcelona after 50 to 150 video views. Berlin is responsible for the second review from 8,000 to 15,000 views and the third review from about 20,000 views. At night, German-speaking Chinese moderate content from Beijing. TikTok confirmed this to netzpolitik.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Facebook, moderation rules are quite skimpy: according to the source, they fit into a table just a few pages long. The instructions netzpolitik.org was able to see are confusingly vague. This leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and the restriction of content can be interpreted very broadly, because the set of rules does not have the –&lt;a href=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org/2019/exklusiver-einblick-so-funktionieren-facebooks-moderationszentren/&quot;&gt;in many cases much clearer- character of Facebook moderation criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delete, demote, push&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules divide unwanted content into four categories. This is reported by the source and shows in the moderation rules that netzpolitik.org was able to see. Videos that completely violate the conditions of the platform are deleted („deletion“). Other contents are marked as „visible to self“. This means that the user can still see the video him- or herself, but it is no longer visible to others.&lt;br/&gt;A marking as „not for feed“ or „not recommend“ means that the video no longer appears in the algorithmically curated newsfeed that the user sees when opening the app. The marking can also lead to disadvantages in the search and visibility in hashtags, says the source. Strictly speaking, such contributions are not deleted – but in fact they no longer have an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Featured: Pushed by marketing department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General: Limited as „risk“ in certain markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not recommend: Not in For You Feed / can be shared in profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not for Feed: Not in For You Feed / disadvantages in search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visible to self: Only visible for user him/herself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion: Deletion of content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For non-restricted videos, there are two levels. Most of them are categorized as „General“. However, by marking „Risks“ you can block or throttle content regionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos whose distribution the marketing department wants to increase can be pushed with the „Featured“ mark. TikTok confirmed to netzpolitik.org only the existence of „Deletion“, „Visible to self“ and „Risks“. The „Risks“ are necessary so that the videos do not violate local laws in certain countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source tells us that not only content can be slowed down, but also entire hashtags. In general, TikTok seems to drive a system of promoting and throttling, where certain content is visible and viral, while others never take off or gain visibility. Control over what people see on TikTok is primarily in the hands of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Controlled content policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests are generally not welcome on the platform, says the source. Due to the orientation of TikTok, there is less protest content than on other platforms, but often such videos never even make it to marketing, instead being deleted right at first viewing in the moderation process at other locations such as Barcelona. The „deletion teams“ do not watch the whole videos, but only individual frames, and sound is only listened to on suspicion. Tiktok denies the moderation of content on the basis of political orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If content gets through to the marketing team, this determines the composition of the curated For-You feed, which is algorithmically tailored and played out to the individual users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the moderation, the moderators not only mark content for deletion or throttling, they also classify what they see. „This is done to help build an automated moderation,“ tells us the source, who has insight into the moderation. To netzpolitik.org, Tiktok denied tagging to teach artificial intelligence, but that algorithmic systems are used „to check when posting content“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Criticism of politics was previously excluded from Feed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the source, TikTok changed its moderation rules after the Guardian’s September reporting and subsequent criticism. The source says that the company explicitly referred to the bad press in front of employees. The extent of the changes has been unique to date, but smaller modifications are more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing&quot;&gt;told the Guardian that these changes were made this May&lt;/a&gt;; however to netzpolitik.org the company now states that these significant changes were made „much earlier“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this major adjustment, moderation rules had almost completely ruled out criticism of politics and political systems. Those who criticised constitutional monarchy, parliamentary systems, separation of powers or socialist systems were throttled. Only with the major changes was this „ban on politics“ removed from the moderation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2019/11/tiktok-auszug-moderationsregeln-abschrift-1.pdf&quot;&gt;An excerpt from TikTok‘s moderation policy (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, which documents several rules before and after the change, is published here. For reasons of source protection, this is not the original document, but a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demonstrations still easy to censor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The throttling of depictions of so-called „controversial events“ has also been changed. Until then, this had generally included protests, riots and demonstrations. A list also included examples such as the Kurdish, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence movements. After revision, the depiction of demonstrations and protests is no longer restricted per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, demonstrations with the reference to „possible violent conflicts“ can still be marked „not for feed“ and downgraded according to the current rules. TikTok says it does not remove such content. However, this was not an answer to the question posed. Netzpolitik.org had asked for the throttling classification „not for feed“, as the moderation policy versions available to us did not dictate complete removal in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2019/11/tik-tok-auszug-controversial-events-1200x418-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-244150&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2019/11/tik-tok-auszug-controversial-events-1200x418-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot Moderationskriterien&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2019/11/tik-tok-auszug-controversial-events-1200x418-1.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2019/11/tik-tok-auszug-controversial-events-1200x418-1-860x300.jpg 860w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In September TikTok revised its moderation rules. Content that shows demonstrations can still be throttled as „controversial events“ – thanks to a rubber paragraf.
&lt;p&gt;Previously, criticism of public political figures, the police and the military had been banned from the feed. TikTok has meanwhile abolished these rules in Germany, which the company also confirms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LGTBQI content is not played out in many countries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, certain content used to be marked as „Islam Offence“. Content marked with this keyword, for example two kissing men, triggered a geoblock for certain regions. LGTBQI content in particular was affected. This regulation was abolished after the Guardian report. Or rather: renamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents that deal with sexual orientation are now given the keyword „Risk 3.4“ – the consequence being, as with the „Islam Offence“ before, that these contents are throttled in Islamic countries. The marking with a risk (there are many more), lead to geoblocking, says the source. TikTok argues that one has to abide by local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protests in Hong Kong hardly visible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since TikTok belongs to a Chinese company, the handling of the democracy protests in Hong Kong in particular is a good yardstick for censorship attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already in September we had searched the app and the web version for certain hashtags prominent on other networks, such as #hongkongprotest, #freehongkong or #antielab, and found no or very few results. Instead, under these hashtags, the app showed videos that had nothing to do with the protests. Only after a press inquiry at TikTok in Germany, some videos became visible, also those we tried to upload with a specially created account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we did our research in September, the protests in Hong Kong were mostly invisible. Hashtags such as #joshuawong were not displayed (far left), displayed videos had no reference to the hashtags (see other three screenshots). All rights reserved Screenshots App TikTok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, the company spokeswoman said to netzpolitik.org:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are on TikTok because the app gives them a positive, fun experience where they can exert their creativity. Our users mainly upload and watch short and entertaining videos on TikTok. TikTok’s moderation follows our community guidelines and terms of use and does not remove videos related to the Hong Kong protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overspecific statement can mean: Our users do not upload political content, there are hardly any videos about the protests in Hong Kong and we don’t delete them either. However, the statement leaves completely open whether TikTok has systematically disadvantaged videos about Hong Kong via the different levels of visibility and thus made them invisible to the public. The search for the Hashtag #JoshuaWong, for example, did not lead to any results in the TikTok app in September. Indeed, there was no Hashtag at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok tells netzpolitik.org that today there are no content restrictions on protests in Hong Kong and Joshua Wong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent test, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article203560922/Chinesische-App-TikTok-filtert-kritische-politische-Inhalte.html&quot;&gt;the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag had found that&lt;/a&gt; the search for keywords controversial from the point of view of the Chinese Government, such as „falungong“, „tiananmenmassacre“ and „Tiananmensquare, did not yield any or only very few fitting content. Numerous app searches from netzpolitik.org come to a similar result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;„Tame and Steered“&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christian Mihr of Reporters Without Borders, netzpolitik.org’s research confirms fears that TikTok is under the influence of the Chinese state – even though it is a private company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/china/alle-meldungen/meldung/china-strebt-nach-weltweiter-medien-hegemonie/&quot;&gt;It is part of Beijing’s media strategy&lt;/a&gt; to internationally enforce its totalitarian vision of tame, controlled media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„If the reach of for example protest content on TikTok is throttled, this fits the picture perfectly, since protests in Hong Kong or Xinjiang are a taboo topic for media in China, just as they are abroad,“ says Mihr. He criticizes TikTok’s approach as a „sign of great lack of transparency“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About this research and the sources:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our knowledge about the moderation at TikTok in Germany is based on several hours of conversation between netzpolitik.org and a source that has insight into the moderation structures and the policy. We checked the identity of the source and its employment contract. We cannot and do not want to describe the source in more detail for reasons of whistleblower protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should you have further information or documents about TikTok, we would be pleased to hear from you. You can also directly send information directly – encrypted if you wish. Do not use e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, networks or company devices for this purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Web Began Dying in 2014 (2017)</title>
<link>https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;The Web began dying in 2014, here's how&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;30 Oct 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the year 2014, there were many people using Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Today, there are still many people using services from those three tech giants (respectively, GOOG, FB, AMZN). Not much has changed, and quite literally the user interface and features on those sites has remained mostly untouched. However, the underlying dynamics of power on the Web have drastically changed, and those three companies are at the center of a fundamental transformation of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like nothing changed since 2014, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet activity itself hasn’t slowed down. It maintains a steady growth, both in amount of users and amount of websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amount of internet users and websites from 2011 to 2017&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey&quot;&gt;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/&quot;&gt;http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has changed over the last 4 years is market share of traffic on the Web. It looks like nothing has changed, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic. Mobile internet traffic is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/306528/share-of-mobile-internet-traffic-in-global-regions/&quot;&gt;majority of traffic worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and in Latin America alone, GOOG and FB services have had 60% of mobile traffic in 2015, growing to 70% by the end of 2016. The remaining 30% of traffic is shared among all other mobile apps and websites. Mobile devices are primarily used for accessing GOOG and FB networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share of internet traffic in Latin America from 2015 to 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&quot;&gt;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The press, unlike before, depends on GOOG-FB to stay in business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another demonstration of GOOG and FB dominance can be seen among media websites. The most popular web properties that don’t belong to GOOG nor FB are usually from the press. For instance, in the USA there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/271412/most-visited-us-web-properties-based-on-number-of-visitors/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10 websites&lt;/a&gt;; in Brazil there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/254727/most-visited-web-properties-in-brazil/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10&lt;/a&gt;; in UK it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/272871/leading-internet-properties-in-the-uk-by-unique-visitors/&quot;&gt;5 out 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From where do media sites get their traffic? Prior to 2014, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was a common practice among Web Developers to improve their site for Google searches, since it accounted for approximately 35% of traffic, while more than 50% of traffic came from various other places on the Web. SEO was important, while Facebook presence was nice-to-have. Over the next 3 years, traffic from Facebook grew to be approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-socialmedia/two-thirds-of-american-adults-get-news-from-social-media-survey-idUSKCN1BJ2A8&quot;&gt;45%&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the status that Search traffic had. In 2017, the Media depends on both Google and Facebook for page views, since it’s the majority of their traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Referral source of traffic to top web publishers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&quot;&gt;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between media sites and the two tech giants is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15948196&quot;&gt;difficult&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, FB built Facebook Paper as an attempt to have a larger control over news consumption. Their tactic failed, but their strategy persisted through different means such as Facebook Instant Articles. The media, being dependent on social traffic and threatened by the social behemoth, reacted. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/16/15314210&quot;&gt;pulled out support for Instant Articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, GOOG notices how its Search traffic hadn’t improved, while Facebook had picked up steam, so GOOG launches their Instant Articles alternative called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and proactively starts serving articles from GOOG servers instead of directing traffic to media sites. The press reacts similarly to how they did for FB: reported bold stories about the Search behemoth’s thirst for control over news consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOOG and FB ceased competing directly, focusing on what they do best instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shows FB has dramatically improved its dominance on the Web, while Google Search hasn’t significantly changed. How exactly did FB achieve that, and what events were key to that development? Prior to 2014, both companies had a portfolio of multiple web services. GOOG hadn’t yet become Alphabet, so it’s focus was diffused. GOOG was trying to enter the social market, first with Google Wave, then Google Buzz, Orkut, and Google+. In total, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geckoboard.com/tech-acquisitions/&quot;&gt;GOOG has acquired 18 companies from the social media category&lt;/a&gt;, of which only 1 acquisition happened post-2014, while 5 of those happened in 2010 alone. FB was competing in the search market, through Bing, in partnership with MSFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2014, FB apparently reorganized itself to focus on social only. In February, it bought WhatsApp, for 11 times the price GOOG bought YouTube. In December, it canceled its Bing partnership with MSFT. User retention on Facebook.com grew steadily (see chart below). Through its four simple products, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, FB had become the social superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook daily active users (DAU) divided by Facebook monthly active users (MAU)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, GOOG in 2014 started reorganizing itself to focus on artificial intelligence only. In January 2014, GOOG bought DeepMind, and in September they shutdown Orkut (one of their few social products which had momentary success in some countries) forever. The Alphabet Inc restructuring was announced in August 2015 but it likely took many months of meetings and bureaucracy. The restructuring was important to focus the web-oriented departments at GOOG towards a simple mission. GOOG sees no future in the simple Search market, and announces to be migrating “From Search to Suggest” (in Eric Schmidt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg_KxXhhsGg&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;) and being an “AI first company” (in Sundar Pichai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Og2BnpBhkM&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;). GOOG is currently slightly behind FB in terms of how fast it is growing its dominance of the web, but due to their technical expertise, vast budget, influence and vision, in the long run its AI assets will play a massive role on the internet. They know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are no longer the same companies as 4 years ago. GOOG is not anymore an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the knowledge internet company&lt;/em&gt;. FB is not an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the social internet company&lt;/em&gt;. They used to attempt to compete, and this competition kept the internet market diverse. Today, however, they seem mostly satisfied with their orthogonal dominance of parts of the Web, and we are losing diversity of choices. Which leads us to another part of the internet: e-commerce and AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMZN does not focus on making profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon's Long-Term Growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/chart/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/chart/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, its mission is to seek market leadership, crushing competitors in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon has outgrown competitors&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could elaborate on how AMZN is &lt;em&gt;the e-commerce company&lt;/em&gt;, but I would be just repeating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBjUsmO-Lw&quot;&gt;Scott Galloway’s exposure of this topic&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth watching his talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-was-and-what-it-became&quot;&gt;What the Web was and what it became&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events and data above describe how three internet companies have acquired massive influence on the Web, but why does that imply the beginning of the Web’s death? To answer that, we need to reflect on what the Web is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original vision for the Web according to its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, was a space with multilateral publishing and consumption of information. It was a peer-to-peer vision with no dependency on a single party. Tim himself claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet&quot;&gt;the Web is dying&lt;/a&gt;: the Web he wanted and the Web he got are no longer the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44.753170731707&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t GOOG defend in the open Web?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, as a company born from the Web, has helped take it forward both technologically and in adoption. That is undeniable. They still lead efforts to improve the open Web, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/&quot;&gt;advocacy of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)&lt;/a&gt; over native mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t GOOG trying to guarantee the open Web stays alive? Not necessarily. GOOG’s goal is to gather as much rich data as possible, and build AI. Their mission is to have an AI provide timely and personalized information to us, not specifically to have websites provide information. Any GOOG concerted efforts are aligned to the AI mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile usage is on the rise – having already crossed desktop as the primary channel for internet usage – and native mobile apps are so far the best way of providing good user experience on mobile. GOOG collects little or no data from native mobile apps, to some extent on Android, but specially on iOS. PWAs happen to live in the neutral and open Web, and are better suited for data collection while providing great user experience on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop versus Mobile internet usage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG promotes lock-in and proprietary technologies such as Firebase and Google-dependent AMP installations as much as it advocates open PWAs. GOOG does not consistently defend the open Web. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;dropped XMPP in Gtalk&lt;/a&gt;, and Gtalk itself was deprecated, favoring Google Hangouts with a proprietary protocol. Chrome Web Store is a walled garden like App Store. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/14/tech/web/google-reader-discontinued/index.html&quot;&gt;shutdown Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; based on RSS, an open standard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2017/05/22/google-cloud-tpu-strategic-implications-for-google-nvidia-and-the-machine-learning-industry/3/#60053cf7513d&quot;&gt;Google Cloud TPU&lt;/a&gt; is proprietary hardware that only exists in their datacenters, supporting their open source framework TensorFlow. Google Inbox suffers “proprietary creep”: non-standard, closed algorithms that promise to organize your life, an essential component of a lock-in based business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG is a huge company where employees have autonomy and multiple projects and efforts are occurring. Big efforts, though, are coherent, concerted, and well aligned with its mission: to be an AI-first company, an AI that is closed and lives in their cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 90s until the 2010s, the Web we have experienced has been, albeit somewhat imperfectly, faithful to its original purpose. The Web’s diversity has granted space for multiple businesses to innovate and thrive, independent hobbyist communities to grow, and personal sites to be hosted on whatever physical servers can host them. The internet’s infrastructural diversity is directly tied to the success of diverse Web businesses and communities. The Web’s openness is vital for its security, accessibility, innovation and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2014, we started losing the benefits of the internet’s infrastructural and economical diversity. It is difficult to compete with AMZN’s and GOOG’s Cloud Services, which host a massive amount of sites for other businesses. Any website aspiring for significant traffic depends on Search and Social traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-will-become-under-goog-fb-amzn&quot;&gt;What the Web will become under GOOG-FB-AMZN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following analysis is an extrapolation for the future, based on the current state of the Web and strategies made public by executives at GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The War for Net Neutrality in the USA won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382&quot;&gt;battle in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2017 we are seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15715030&quot;&gt;second battle&lt;/a&gt; which is more likely to be lost. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are probably soon going to dictate what traffic can or cannot arrive at people’s end devices. GOOG-FB-AMZN traffic would be the most common, due to their popularity among internet users. Because of this market demand, ISPs will likely provide cheap plans with access to GOOG-FB-AMZN, while offering more expensive plans with full internet access. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/79770i/in_portugal_with_no_net_neutrality_internet/&quot;&gt;It is already a reality in Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. This would grow even more the dominance the three tech giants already enjoy. There would be no more economical incentive for smaller businesses to have independent websites, and a gradual migration towards Facebook Pages would make more sense. Smaller e-commerce sites would be bought by AMZN or go bankrupt. Because most internet users couldn’t open all the sites, GOOG would have little incentive to be a mere bridge between people and sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG’s shift away from Search is a sign how they are growing their strategy beyond the Web. For many years, Google used to be just a tool that played the important role of assisting the Web, by indexing it. Lately, however, it is not attractive for Google to be a mere search engine of the Web. For the purposes expressed in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin&quot;&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;, “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”, the search engine approach has been exhausted. The multi-second path from search query, to search results, to webpage, to information, is too long to provide an ideal user experience. Their goal is to cut the middlemen in that path. They have tried to cut out the results page with their “I’m feeling lucky” button, but without intelligent analysis they cannot reliably take shortcuts in that path. With AI, they believe they can shorten the path to just one step, “get information”, even without searching for it in the first place. That’s the purpose of Suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an index, people have different expectations on search result neutrality. Some want Google Search to be entirely neutral, some demand immediate action to remove some results. The European Union has both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-must-delete-search-results-rules-european-court/&quot;&gt;demanded GOOG to comply with removal requests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/google-gets-record-2-7-billion-eu-fine-for-skewing-searches&quot;&gt;fined GOOG for not being neutral in shopping queries&lt;/a&gt;. It is not beneficial for GOOG to assume the role of an impartial arbiter of content, since it’s not supporting their business model. Quite the contrary, they are under public scrutiny from multiple governments, potentially risking their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Suggest strategy is being currently deployed through Google Now, Google Assistant, Android notifications, and Google Home. None of these mentioned technologies are part of Web, in other words, not part of “browser-land” made of websites. The internet is just the underlying transport layer for data from their cloud to end-user devices, but the Web itself is being bypassed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-internet-765989&quot;&gt;Schmidt’s vision for the future&lt;/a&gt; is one where internet services are ubiquitous and personalized, as opposed to an experience contained in web browsers in desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while AMZN’s business still relies on traffic to their desktop web portal (accounting for 33% of sales), a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/690366/amazon-purchase-channels-usa/&quot;&gt;large portion&lt;/a&gt; (25%) of their sales happen through mobile apps, not to mention Amazon Echo. Like Google Home, Amazon Echo bypasses the Web and uses the internet just for communication between cloud and end user. In these new non-web contexts, tech giants have more authority over data traffic. They can even directly block each other, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-google/amazon-says-google-has-pulled-youtube-from-echo-show-device-in-tech-face-off-idUSKCN1C20A8&quot;&gt;GOOG recently cut support for YouTube traffic in Amazon Echo devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-appleification-of-tech-giants&quot;&gt;The Appleification of tech giants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, MSFT, FB, and AMZN are mimicking AAPL’s strategy of building brand loyalty around high-end devices. Through a process I call “Appleification”, they are (1) setting up walled gardens, (2) becoming hardware companies, and (3) marketing the design while designing for the market. It is a threat to AAPL itself, because they are behind the other giants when it comes to big data collection and its uses. While AAPL’s early and bold introduction of an App Store shook the Web as the dominant software distribution platform, it wasn’t enough to replace it. The next wave of walled gardens might look different: less noticeable, but nonetheless disruptive to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GOOG devices&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency at GOOG-FB-AMZN to bypass the Web which is motivated by user experience and efficient communication, not by an agenda to avoid browsers. In the knowledge internet and the commerce internet, being efficient to provide what users want is the goal. In the social internet, the goal is to provide an efficient channel for communication between people. This explains FB’s 10-year strategy with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) as the next medium for social interactions through the internet. This strategy would also bypass the Web, proving how more natural social AR would be than social real-time texting in browsers. Already today, most people on the internet communicate with other people via a mobile app, not via a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common pattern among these three internet giants is to grow beyond browsers, creating new virtual contexts where data is created and shared. The Web may die like most other technologies do: simply by becoming less attractive than newer technologies. And like most obsolete technologies, they don’t suddenly disappear, neither do they disappear completely. You can still buy a Walkman and listen to a tape with it, but the technology has nevertheless lost its collective relevance. The Web’s death will come as a gradual decay of its necessity, not as a dramatic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-trinet&quot;&gt;The Trinet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet will survive longer than the Web will. GOOG-FB-AMZN will still depend on submarine internet cables (the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;”), because it is a technical success. That said, many aspects of the internet will lose their relevance, and the underlying infrastructure could be optimized only for GOOG traffic, FB traffic, and AMZN traffic. It wouldn’t conceptually be anymore a “network of networks”, but just a “network of three networks”, the &lt;em&gt;Trinet&lt;/em&gt;, if you will. The concept of workplace network which gave birth to the internet infrastructure would migrate to a more abstract level: Facebook Groups, Google Hangouts, G Suite, and other competing services which can be acquired by a tech giant. Workplace networks are already today emulated in software as a service, not as traditional Local Area Networks. To improve user experience, the Trinet would be a technical evolution of the internet. These efforts are already happening today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/07/17/google-wants-rewire-internet/&quot;&gt;at GOOG&lt;/a&gt;. In the long-term, supporting routing for the old internet and the old Web would be an overhead, so it could be beneficial to cut support for the diverse internet on the protocol and hardware level. Access to the old internet could be emulated on GOOG’s cloud accessed through the Trinet, much like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://win95.ajf.me/&quot;&gt;Windows 95 can be today emulated in your browser&lt;/a&gt;. ISPs would recognize the obsolescence of the internet and support the Trinet only, driven by market demand for optimal user experience from GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a future with great user experience in AR, VR, hands-free commerce and knowledge sharing could evoke an optimistic perspective for what these tech giants are building. But 25 years of the Web has gotten us used to foundational freedoms that we take for granted. We forget how useful it has been to remain anonymous and control what we share, or how easy it was to start an internet startup with its own independent servers operating with the same rights GOOG servers have. On the Trinet, if you are permanently banned from GOOG or FB, you would have no alternative. You could even be restricted from creating a new account. As private businesses, GOOG, FB, and AMZN don’t need to guarantee you access to their networks. You do not have a legal right to an account in their servers, and as societies we aren’t demanding for these rights as vehemently as we could, to counter the strategies that tech giants are putting forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web and the internet have represented freedom: efficient and unsupervised exchange of information between people of all nations. In the Trinet, we will have even more vivid exchange of information between people, but we will sacrifice freedom. Many of us will wake up to the tragedy of this tradeoff only once it is reality.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cryptoqueen: A woman scammed the world, then vanished</title>

<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;The Missing Cryptoqueen&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/101E2/production/_109681066_queen_promo-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Ruja Ignatova called herself the Cryptoqueen. She told people she had invented a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, and persuaded them to invest billions. Then, two years ago, she disappeared. Jamie Bartlett spent months investigating how she did it for the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, and trying to figure out where she's hiding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency &quot;for everyone to make payments everywhere&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Dr Ruja speaking at the Wembley Arena
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the &quot;Bitcoin Killer&quot;. &quot;In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!&quot; she shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost €30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, €2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than €4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemen… even Palestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was something very important these investors didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about £250,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'&quot; he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. &quot;So we need you to build a blockchain,&quot; he went on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What's the name of the company?&quot; asked Bjercke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's OneCoin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't take the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Jen McAdam's 'tycoon' package&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Jen McAdam on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were &quot;very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion&quot;, she remembers. &quot;You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,&quot; she was told. &quot;You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. &quot;That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The video of Dr Ruja at the Economist conference was what clinched it for Jen McAdam
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest €1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe €1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost €140, but they went all the way up to €118,000. One week later McAdam bought a &quot;tycoon&quot; package, for €5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, she had invested €10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest €250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed £100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - &quot;the biggest scam in the [expletive] world&quot;. He said he could prove it, too. &quot;Well then prove it to me!&quot; she replied, sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Jen McAdam has a fiery Skype call with cryptocurrency enthusiast Tim Curry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;OK Jen… they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'&quot; she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Dr Ruja disappears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop star &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CryptoXpose/status/1179838529825849350&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Bebe Rexha performed a private set&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,&quot; recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;MLM's most successful product&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,&quot; he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan &quot;What dreams may come&quot;. A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made €100m over the last 30 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how multi-level marketing works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pay £100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her &quot;princess's dresses&quot; and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. &quot;We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,&quot; he says. &quot;We made in our first month almost €90,000 out of nothing. Bang!&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as &quot;the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM&quot;. This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its &quot;product&quot;. No wonder it spread like wildfire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than €1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. &quot;No other company even came close,&quot; Alberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than €2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buy &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; OneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,&quot; Igor says. &quot;I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to €100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them  - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I felt responsibility. Not guilt,&quot; he replies. &quot;You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchain… What doubt can I have?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was €3,000 - €1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Following the money &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say €4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as €15bn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a famous saying in journalism, &quot;Follow the money.&quot; So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. &quot;They still exist&quot;, he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. &quot;You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    A page on the OneCoin website
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as &quot;improbably standard&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. &quot;British companies are the companies of choice,&quot; he comments. &quot;They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. &quot;We are very proud of this in this country,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided.&quot; He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. &quot;This is classic,&quot; he exclaims. &quot;Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all.&quot; Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with &quot;significant control&quot; - the real owner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,&quot; he says, as he scrolls down the page. &quot;Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegal… That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Find out more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast.&quot; According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,&quot; Bjercke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of &quot;very influential people&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask for more details, he replies: &quot;No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and &quot;significant players in Eastern European organised crime&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Inside 'the family'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested ,and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the &quot;visionary&quot; Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin &quot;family&quot;. She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own &quot;leader&quot; who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. &quot;You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',&quot; she recalls. &quot;That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'&quot; Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. &quot;If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,&quot; she was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,&quot; she says. &quot;Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. &quot;And in that sense it's cultic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. &quot;We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,&quot; it said. &quot;We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,&quot; said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. &quot;If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. &quot;The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,&quot; it said. &quot;We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. &quot;I'm devastated for all the UK victims,&quot; Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. &quot;Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of London Police told the BBC: &quot;There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;A Ugandan tragedy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was no other way,&quot; he says ruefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;

                    Daniel, Prudence and Jamie with children in the poor area of Kampala where Prudence works as a nurse
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. &quot;One Life!&quot; he shouts. &quot;One Coin!&quot; the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family had saved about £3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Daniel and his mother
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,&quot; he tells me. &quot;I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask him why not. &quot;It's hard. It's hard to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe you can tell her… Maybe…&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,&quot; she says. &quot;You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Where are you, Dr Ruja?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,&quot; he says. &quot;Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Dr Ruja was renowned for expensive dresses and red lipstick
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. &quot;You will find her,&quot; he said. &quot;You must dig deeper.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were &quot;haters&quot; who could not be believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a &quot;big passport&quot;, he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: &quot;OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency.&quot; It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast &quot;will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased&quot;. It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: &quot;Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;social-embed&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;social-embed-post social-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;

She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.   &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japanese hotel room costs $1 a night, but you have to livestream your stay</title>
<link>https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/livestream-hotel-room-japan-intl-hnk/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/livestream-hotel-room-japan-intl-hnk/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;Paragraph__cite&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;span&gt;When 27-year-old Tetsuya Inoue began running Asahi Ryokan -- a hotel in the Japanese city of Fukuoka that is owned by his grandmother -- he wondered how he could improve business in the new economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inoue had an idea: what if he could use the internet to bring in a new audience and a new revenue stream?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, guests coming to Asahi Ryokan have the option to pay just ¥100 (about $1) per night to stay the night -- if they agree to have their entire stay livestreamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage__component&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image__component CaptionedImage__image Image__hasAspectRatio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Image__image&quot; src=&quot;https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191120162643-asahi-ryokan-room.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;asahi ryokan room&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room number 8 at Asahi Ryokan costs just ¥100 (about $1) per night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Asahi Ryokan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, there are restrictions around how the livestreaming works. Inoue explains to CNN Travel that the feed is video-only, so guests will have privacy in their conversations or phone calls. His YouTube channel is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdBk23h9vFs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One Dollar Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Guests are permitted to turn the lights off, and the bathroom area is out of camera range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;This is a very old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/most-beautiful-ryokans-japan/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ryokan&lt;/a&gt; and I was looking into a new business model,&quot; says Inoue, who started running the hotel last year. &quot;Our hotel is on the cheaper side, so we need some added value, something special that everyone will talk about.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far, four guests have taken him up on the offer since Inoue began offering the deal last month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage__component&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image__component CaptionedImage__image Image__hasAspectRatio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Image__image&quot; src=&quot;https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191120150945-asahi-ryokan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;asahi ryokan&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sign in the livestreamed room warns guests about dos and don'ts of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Asahi Ryokan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Young people nowadays don't care much about the privacy,&quot; Inoue adds. &quot;Some of them say it's OK to be [watched] for just one day.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And while the $1 rooms are clearly a loss leader, Inoue is thinking beyond the cost of a single night's stay. The YouTube channel has already passed 1,000 subscribers. Once it accumulates more than 4,000 view hours, he will be able to put ads on the channel and monetize it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On days when the room is vacant or no one is streaming, Inoue will post a livestream of himself working in the ryokan's office. Signs in Japanese and English are posted in front of the camera to let viewers know when he's out of the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage__component&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image__component CaptionedImage__image Image__hasAspectRatio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;Image__image&quot; src=&quot;https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191120141713-asahi-ryokan-fukuoka-japan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;asahi ryokan fukuoka japan&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel manager Tetsuya Inoue appears on the live feed himself during coverage gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Ryokan/YouTube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, besides the opportunity to have thousands of strangers watch your REM cycle on the internet, what's the incentive to head to Fukuoka?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pretty seaside city is known for its incredible food. In addition to local, freshly-caught seafood, Fukuoka is also the birthplace of the popular Ichiran chain, home of yummy pork tonkotsu ramen. Also, the acclaimed Fukuoka Art Museum reopened in early 2019 following three years of renovations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.onedollarhotel.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asahi Ryokan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, 2-6-2 Kiyokawa, Chuo-ku, Fukuoka, +81 090 5212 3216&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An earlier version of this piece stated that there is one room available to livestream, but there are actually two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hard Problems in Cryptocurrency: Five Years Later</title>
<link>https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Justin Drake and Jinglan Wang for feedback&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems/89fd07ffff8b042134e4ca67a0ce143d574016bd&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXRtJcNVfQE&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; with a list of hard problems in math, computer science and economics that I thought were important for the cryptocurrency space (as I then called it) to be able to reach maturity. In the last five years, much has changed. But exactly how much progress on what we thought then was important has been achieved? Where have we succeeded, where have we failed, and where have we changed our minds about what is important? In this post, I'll go through the 16 problems from 2014 one by one, and see just where we are today on each one. At the end, I’ll include my new picks for hard problems of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems are broken down into three categories: (i) cryptographic, and hence expected to be solvable with purely mathematical techniques if they are to be solvable at all, (ii) consensus theory, largely improvements to proof of work and proof of stake, and (iii) economic, and hence having to do with creating structures involving incentives given to different participants, and often involving the application layer more than the protocol layer. We see significant progress in all categories, though some more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptographic-problems&quot;&gt;Cryptographic problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blockchain Scalability One of the largest problems facing the cryptocurrency space today is the issue of scalability ... The main concern with [oversized blockchains] is trust: if there are only a few entities capable of running full nodes, then those entities can conspire and agree to give themselves a large number of additional bitcoins, and there would be no way for other users to see for themselves that a block is invalid without processing an entire block themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; create a blockchain design that maintains Bitcoin-like security guarantees, but where the maximum size of the most powerful node that needs to exist for the network to keep functioning is substantially sublinear in the number of transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Great theoretical progress, pending more real-world evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face7.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalability is one technical problem that we have had a huge amount of progress on theoretically. Five years ago, almost no one was thinking about sharding; now, sharding designs are commonplace. Aside from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs&quot;&gt;ethereum 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf&quot;&gt;OmniLedger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09274&quot;&gt;LazyLedger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@giottodf/zilliqa-a-novel-approach-to-sharding-d79249347a1f&quot;&gt;Zilliqa&lt;/a&gt; and research papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10434.pdf&quot;&gt;seemingly coming out every month&lt;/a&gt;. In my own view, further progress at this point is incremental. Fundamentally, we already have a number of techniques that allow groups of validators to securely come to consensus on much more data than an individual validator can process, as well as techniques allow clients to indirectly verify the full validity and availability of blocks even under 51% attack conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are probably the most important technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other smaller developments like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#how-can-we-facilitate-cross-shard-communication&quot;&gt;Cross-shard communication via receipts&lt;/a&gt; as well as &quot;constant-factor&quot; enhancements such as BLS signature aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, fully sharded blockchains have still not been seen in live operation (the partially sharded Zilliqa has recently started running). On the theoretical side, there are mainly disputes about details remaining, along with challenges having to do with stability of sharded networking, developer experience and mitigating risks of centralization; fundamental technical possibility no longer seems in doubt. But the challenges that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remain are challenges that cannot be solved by just thinking about them; only developing the system and seeing ethereum 2.0 or some similar chain running live will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timestamping &lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; create a distributed incentive-compatible system, whether it is an overlay on top of a blockchain or its own blockchain, which maintains the current time to high accuracy. All legitimate users have clocks in a normal distribution around some &quot;real&quot; time with standard deviation 20 seconds ... no two nodes are more than 20 seconds apart The solution is allowed to rely on an existing concept of &quot;N nodes&quot;; this would in practice be enforced with proof-of-stake or non-sybil tokens (see #9). The system should continuously provide a time which is within 120s (or less if possible) of the internal clock of &amp;gt;99% of honestly participating nodes. External systems may end up relying on this system; hence, it should remain secure against attackers controlling &amp;lt; 25% of nodes regardless of incentives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum has actually survived just fine with a 13-second block time and no particularly advanced timestamping technology; it uses a simple technique where a client does not accept a block whose stated timestamp is earlier than the client's local time. That said, this has not been tested under serious attacks. The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/network-adjusted-timestamps/4187&quot;&gt;network-adjusted timestamps&lt;/a&gt; proposal tries to improve on the status quo by allowing the client to determine the consensus on the time in the case where the client does not locally know the current time to high accuracy; this has not yet been tested. But in general, timestamping is not currently at the foreground of perceived research challenges; perhaps this will change once more proof of stake chains (including Ethereum 2.0 but also others) come online as real live systems and we see what the issues are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary Proof of Computation &lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; create programs &lt;code&gt;POC_PROVE(P,I) -&amp;gt; (O,Q)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;POC_VERIFY(P,O,Q) -&amp;gt; { 0, 1 }&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;POC_PROVE&lt;/code&gt; runs program &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; on input &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and returns the program output &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; and a proof-of-computation &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; and POC_VERIFY takes &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; and outputs whether or not &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; were legitimately produced by the &lt;code&gt;POC_PROVE&lt;/code&gt; algorithm using &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Great theoretical and practical progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically saying, build a SNARK (or STARK, or SHARK, or...). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/zk-snarks-under-the-hood-b33151a013f6&quot;&gt;we've&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/07/21/starks_part_3.html&quot;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;! SNARKs are now increasingly well understood, and are even already being used in multiple blockchains today (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://tornado.cash/&quot;&gt;tornado.cash&lt;/a&gt; on Ethereum). And SNARKs are extremely useful, both as a privacy technology (see Zcash and tornado.cash) and as a scalability technology (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-scaling-to-potentially-500-tx-sec-through-mass-tx-validation/3477&quot;&gt;ZK Rollup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starkdex.io/&quot;&gt;STARKDEX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/stark-proving-low-degree-ness-of-a-data-availability-root-some-analysis/6214&quot;&gt;STARKing erasure coded data roots&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still challenges with efficiency; making arithmetization-friendly hash functions (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://starkware.co/hash-challenge/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mimchash.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for bounties for breaking proposed candidates) is a big one, and efficiently proving random memory accesses is another. Furthermore, there's the unsolved question of whether the O(n * log(n)) blowup in prover time is a fundamental limitation or if there is some way to make a succinct proof with only linear overhead as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~buenz/pubs/bulletproofs.pdf&quot;&gt;bulletproofs&lt;/a&gt; (which unfortunately take linear time to verify). There are also ever-present risks that the existing schemes have bugs. In general, the problems are in the details rather than the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code Obfuscation The holy grail is to create an obfuscator O, such that given any program P the obfuscator can produce a second program O(P) = Q such that P and Q return the same output if given the same input and, importantly, Q reveals no information whatsoever about the internals of P. One can hide inside of Q a password, a secret encryption key, or one can simply use Q to hide the proprietary workings of the algorithm itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Slow progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In plain English, the problem is saying that we want to come up with a way to &quot;encrypt&quot; a program so that the encrypted program would still give the same outputs for the same inputs, but the &quot;internals&quot; of the program would be hidden. An example use case for obfuscation is a program containing a private key where the program only allows the private key to sign certain messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution to code obfuscation would be very useful to blockchain protocols. The use cases are subtle, because one must deal with the possibility that an on-chain obfuscated program will be copied and run in an environment different from the chain itself, but there are many possibilities. One that personally interests me is the ability to remove the centralized operator from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413&quot;&gt;collusion-resistance gadgets&lt;/a&gt; by replacing the operator with an obfuscated program that contains some proof of work, making it very expensive to run more than once with different inputs as part of an attempt to determine individual participants' actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this continues to be a hard problem. There is continuing ongoing work in attacking the problem, one side making constructions (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/615&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) that try to reduce the number of assumptions on mathematical objects that we do not know practically exist (eg. general cryptographic multilinear maps) and another side trying to make practical implementations of the desired mathematical objects. However, all of these paths are still quite far from creating something viable and known to be secure. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/463.pdf&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/463.pdf&lt;/a&gt; for a more general overview to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hash-Based Cryptography &lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; create a signature algorithm relying on no security assumption but the random oracle property of hashes that maintains 160 bits of security against classical computers (ie. 80 vs. quantum due to Grover's algorithm) with optimal size and other properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been two strands of progress on this since 2014. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptojedi.org/papers/sphincs-20141001.pdf&quot;&gt;SPHINCS&lt;/a&gt;, a &quot;stateless&quot; (meaning, using it multiple times does not require remembering information like a nonce) signature scheme, was released soon after this &quot;hard problems&quot; list was published, and provides a purely hash-based signature scheme of size around 41 kB. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/07/21/starks_part_3.html&quot;&gt;STARKs&lt;/a&gt; have been developed, and one can create signatures of similar size based on them. The fact that not just signatures, but also general-purpose zero knowledge proofs, are possible with just hashes was definitely something I did not expect five years ago; I am very happy that this is the case. That said, size continues to be an issue, and ongoing progress (eg. see the very recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12243&quot;&gt;DEEP FRI&lt;/a&gt;) is continuing to reduce the size of proofs, though it looks like further progress will be incremental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main not-yet-solved problem with hash-based cryptography is aggregate signatures, similar to what &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105&quot;&gt;BLS aggregation&lt;/a&gt; makes possible. It's known that we can just make a STARK over many Lamport signatures, but this is inefficient; a more efficient scheme would be welcome. (In case you're wondering if hash-based &lt;em&gt;public key encryption&lt;/em&gt; is possible, the answer is, no, you can't do anything with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boazbarak.org/Papers/merkle.pdf&quot;&gt;more than a quadratic attack cost&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;ASIC-Resistant Proof of Work One approach at solving the problem is creating a proof-of-work algorithm based on a type of computation that is very difficult to specialize ... For a more in-depth discussion on ASIC-resistant hardware, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/06/19/mining/&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/06/19/mining/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Solved as far as we can&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six months after the &quot;hard problems&quot; list was posted, Ethereum settled on its ASIC-resistant proof of work algorithm: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash&quot;&gt;Ethash&lt;/a&gt;. Ethash is known as a memory-hard algorithm. The theory is that random-access memory in regular computers is well-optimized already and hence difficult to improve on for specialized applications. Ethash aims to achieve ASIC resistance by making memory access the dominant part of running the PoW computation. Ethash was not the first memory-hard algorithm, but it did add one innovation: it uses pseudorandom lookups over a two-level DAG, allowing for two ways of evaluating the function. First, one could compute it quickly if one has the entire (~2 GB) DAG; this is the memory-hard &quot;fast path&quot;. Second, one can compute it much more slowly (still fast enough to check a single provided solution quickly) if one only has the top level of the DAG; this is used for block verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethash has proven remarkably successful at ASIC resistance; after three years and billions of dollars of block rewards, ASICs do exist but are at best &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.miningstore.com/blog/ethereum-mining-hardware-for-2019&quot;&gt;2-5 times more power and cost-efficient&lt;/a&gt; than GPUs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW&quot;&gt;ProgPoW&lt;/a&gt; has been proposed as an alternative, but there is a growing consensus that ASIC-resistant algorithms will inevitably have a limited lifespan, and that ASIC resistance &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/&quot;&gt;has downsides&lt;/a&gt; because it makes 51% attacks cheaper (eg. see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-classic-51-attack-the-reality-of-proof-of-work&quot;&gt;51% attack on Ethereum Classic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that PoW algorithms that provide a medium level of ASIC resistance can be created, but such resistance is limited-term and both ASIC and non-ASIC PoW have disadvantages; in the long term the better choice for blockchain consensus is proof of stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Useful Proof of Work making the proof of work function something which is simultaneously useful; a common candidate is something like Folding@home, an existing program where users can download software onto their computers to simulate protein folding and provide researchers with a large supply of data to help them cure diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Probably not feasible, with one exception&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge with useful proof of work is that a proof of work algorithm requires many properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard to compute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to verify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not depend on large amounts of external data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be efficiently computed in small &quot;bite-sized&quot; chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are not many computations that are useful that preserve all of these properties, and most computations that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have all of those properties and are &quot;useful&quot; are only &quot;useful&quot; for far too short a time to build a cryptocurrency around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is one possible exception: zero-knowledge-proof generation. Zero knowledge proofs of aspects of blockchain validity (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/stark-proving-low-degree-ness-of-a-data-availability-root-some-analysis/6214&quot;&gt;data availability roots&lt;/a&gt; for a simple example) are difficult to compute, and easy to verify. Furthermore, they are durably difficult to compute; if proofs of &quot;highly structured&quot; computation become too easy, one can simply switch to verifying a blockchain's entire state transition, which becomes extremely expensive due to the need to model the virtual machine and random memory accesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero-knowledge proofs of blockchain validity provide great value to users of the blockchain, as they can substitute the need to verify the chain directly; &lt;a href=&quot;https://codaprotocol.com/&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt; is doing this already, albeit with a simplified blockchain design that is heavily optimized for provability. Such proofs can significantly assist in improving the blockchain's safety and scalability. That said, the total amount of computation that realistically needs to be done is still much less than the amount that's currently done by proof of work miners, so this would at best be an add-on for proof of stake blockchains, not a full-on consensus algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proof of Stake Another approach to solving the mining centralization problem is to abolish mining entirely, and move to some other mechanism for counting the weight of each node in the consensus. The most popular alternative under discussion to date is &quot;proof of stake&quot; - that is to say, instead of treating the consensus model as &quot;one unit of CPU power, one vote&quot; it becomes &quot;one currency unit, one vote&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Great theoretical progress, pending more real-world evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of 2014, it became clear to the proof of stake community that some form of &quot;weak subjectivity&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity&quot;&gt;is unavoidable&lt;/a&gt;. To maintain economic security, nodes need to obtain a recent checkpoint extra-protocol when they sync for the first time, and again if they go offline for more than a few months. This was a difficult pill to swallow; many PoW advocates still cling to PoW precisely because in a PoW chain the &quot;head&quot; of the chain can be discovered with the only data coming from a trusted source being the blockchain client software itself. PoS advocates, however, were willing to swallow the pill, seeing the added trust requirements as not being large. From there the path to proof of stake through long-duration security deposits became clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most interesting consensus algorithms today are fundamentally similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf&quot;&gt;PBFT&lt;/a&gt;, but replace the fixed set of validators with a dynamic list that anyone can join by sending tokens into a system-level smart contract with time-locked withdrawals (eg. a withdrawal might in some cases take up to 4 months to complete). In many cases (including ethereum 2.0), these algorithms achieve &quot;economic finality&quot; by penalizing validators that are caught performing actions that violate the protocol in certain ways (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a philosophical view on what proof of stake accomplishes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, we have (among many other algorithms):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be ongoing refinement (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/analysis-of-bouncing-attack-on-ffg/6113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/saving-strategy-and-fmd-ghost/6226&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) . Eth2 phase 0, the chain that will implement FFG, is currently under implementation and enormous progress has been made. Additionally, Tendermint has been running, in the form of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validators&quot;&gt;Cosmos chain&lt;/a&gt; for several months. Remaining arguments about proof of stake, in my view, have to do with optimizing the economic incentives, and further formalizing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363&quot;&gt;strategy for responding to 51% attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/701&quot;&gt;Casper CBC spec&lt;/a&gt; could still use concrete efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proof of Storage A third approach to the problem is to use a scarce computational resource other than computational power or currency. In this regard, the two main alternatives that have been proposed are storage and bandwidth. There is no way in principle to provide an after-the-fact cryptographic proof that bandwidth was given or used, so proof of bandwidth should most accurately be considered a subset of social proof, discussed in later problems, but proof of storage is something that certainly can be done computationally. An advantage of proof-of-storage is that it is completely ASIC-resistant; the kind of storage that we have in hard drives is already close to optimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;A lot of theoretical progress, though still a lot to go, as well as more real-world evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space&quot;&gt;blockchains planning to use proof of storage&lt;/a&gt; protocols, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893.pdf&quot;&gt;Chia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;/a&gt;. That said, these algorithms have not been tested in the wild. My own main concern is centralization: will these algorithms actually be dominated by smaller users using spare storage capacity, or will they be dominated by large mining farms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stable-value cryptoassets One of the main problems with Bitcoin is the issue of price volatility ... Problem: construct a cryptographic asset with a stable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://makerdao.com/en/&quot;&gt;MakerDAO&lt;/a&gt; is now live, and has been holding stable for nearly two years. It has survived a 93% drop in the value of its underlying collateral asset (ETH), and there is now more than $100 million in DAI issued. It has become a mainstay of the Ethereum ecosystem, and many Ethereum projects have or are integrating with it. Other synthetic token projects, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://umaproject.org/&quot;&gt;UMA&lt;/a&gt;, are rapidly gaining steam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the MakerDAO system has survived tough economic conditions in 2019, the conditions were by no means the toughest that could happen. In the past, Bitcoin has &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2017/09/18/bitcoin-crash-history/&quot;&gt;fallen by 75%&lt;/a&gt; over the course of two days; the same may happen to ether or any other collateral asset some day. Attacks on the underlying blockchain are an even larger untested risk, especially if compounded by price decreases at the same time. Another major challenge, and arguably the larger one, is that the stability of MakerDAO-like systems is dependent on some underlying oracle scheme. Different attempts at oracle systems do exist (see #16), but the jury is still out on how well they can hold up under large amounts of economic stress. So far, the collateral controlled by MakerDAO has been lower than the value of the MKR token; if this relationship reverses MKR holders may have a collective incentive to try to &quot;loot&quot; the MakerDAO system. There are ways to try to protect against such attacks, but they have not been tested in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Public Goods Incentivization One of the challenges in economic systems in general is the problem of &quot;public goods&quot;. For example, suppose that there is a scientific research project which will cost $1 million to complete, and it is known that if it is completed the resulting research will save one million people $5 each. In total, the social benefit is clear ... [but] from the point of view of each individual person contributing does not make sense ... So far, most problems to public goods have involved centralization Additional Assumptions And Requirements: A fully trustworthy oracle exists for determining whether or not a certain public good task has been completed (in reality this is false, but this is the domain of another problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of funding public goods is generally understood to be split into two problems: the funding problem (where to get funding for public goods from) and the preference aggregation problem (how to determine what is a genuine public good, rather than some single individual's pet project, in the first place). This problem focuses specifically on the former, assuming the latter is solved (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numberfourteensic&quot;&gt;&quot;decentralized contribution metrics&quot; section below&lt;/a&gt; for work on that problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, there haven't been large new breakthroughs here. There's two major categories of solutions. First, we can try to elicit individual contributions, giving people social rewards for doing so. My own proposal for &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/11/a_note_on_charity.html&quot;&gt;charity through marginal price discrimination&lt;/a&gt; is one example of this; another is the anti-malaria donation badges on &lt;a href=&quot;https://peepeth.com/welcome&quot;&gt;Peepeth&lt;/a&gt;. Second, we can collect funds from applications that have network effects. Within blockchain land there are several options for doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issuing coins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a portion of transaction fees at protocol level (eg. through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1559&quot;&gt;EIP 1559&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a portion of transaction fees from some layer-2 application (eg. Uniswap, or some scaling solution, or even state rent in an execution environment in ethereum 2.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a portion of other kinds of fees (eg. ENS registration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of blockchain land, this is just the age-old question of how to collect taxes if you're a government, and charge fees if you're a business or other organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;12&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reputation systems &lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; design a formalized reputation system, including a score rep(A,B) -&amp;gt; V where V is the reputation of B from the point of view of A, a mechanism for determining the probability that one party can be trusted by another, and a mechanism for updating the reputation given a record of a particular open or finalized interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Slow progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn't really been much work on reputation systems since 2014. Perhaps the best is the use of token curated registries to create curated lists of trustable entities/objects; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kleros.io/erc20-becomes-part-of-the-token/&quot;&gt;Kleros ERC20 TCR&lt;/a&gt; (yes, that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tokencuratedregistry/a-simple-overview-of-token-curated-registries-84e2b7b19a06&quot;&gt;token-curated registry&lt;/a&gt; of legitimate ERC20 tokens) is one example, and there is even an alternative interface to Uniswap (&lt;a href=&quot;http://uniswap.ninja&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;http://uniswap.ninja&lt;/a&gt;) that uses it as the backend to get the list of tokens and ticker symbols and logos from. Reputation systems of the subjective variety have not really been tried, perhaps because there is just not enough information about the &quot;social graph&quot; of people's connections to each other that has already been published to chain in some form. If such information starts to exist for other reasons, then subjective reputation systems may become more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;13&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proof of excellence One interesting, and largely unexplored, solution to the problem of [token] distribution specifically (there are reasons why it cannot be so easily used for mining) is using tasks that are socially useful but require original human-driven creative effort and talent. For example, one can come up with a &quot;proof of proof&quot; currency that rewards players for coming up with mathematical proofs of certain theorems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;No progress, problem is largely forgotten&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main alternative approach to token distribution that has instead become popular is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_%28cryptocurrency%29&quot;&gt;airdrops&lt;/a&gt;; typically, tokens are distributed at launch either proportionately to existing holdings of some other token, or based on some other metric (eg. as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.namebase.io/article/4vchu01mec-handshake-airdrop-101&quot;&gt;Handshake airdrop&lt;/a&gt;). Verifying human creativity directly has not really been attempted, and with recent progress on AI the problem of creating a task that only humans can do but computers can verify may well be too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;15 [sic]. Anti-Sybil systems&lt;/h3&gt;
A problem that is somewhat related to the issue of a reputation system is the challenge of creating a &quot;unique identity system&quot; - a system for generating tokens that prove that an identity is not part of a Sybil attack ... However, we would like to have a system that has nicer and more egalitarian features than &quot;one-dollar-one-vote&quot;; arguably, one-person-one-vote would be ideal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been quite a few attempts at solving the unique-human problem. Attempts that come to mind include (incomplete list!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growing interest in techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting&quot;&gt;quadratic voting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656&quot;&gt;quadratic funding&lt;/a&gt;, the need for some kind of human-based anti-sybil system continues to grow. Hopefully, ongoing development of these techniques and new ones can come to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;14 [sic]. Decentralized contribution metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
Incentivizing the production of public goods is, unfortunately, not the only problem that centralization solves. The other problem is determining, first, which public goods are worth producing in the first place and, second, determining to what extent a particular effort actually accomplished the production of the public good. This challenge deals with the latter issue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress, some change in focus&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent work on determining value of public-good contributions does not try to separate determining tasks and determining quality of completion; the reason is that in practice the two are difficult to separate. Work done by specific teams tends to be non-fungible and subjective enough that the most reasonable approach is to look at relevance of task and quality of performance as a single package, and use the same technique to evaluate both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there has been great progress on this, particularly with the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656&quot;&gt;quadratic funding&lt;/a&gt;. Quadratic funding is a mechanism where individuals can make donations to projects, and then based on the number of people who donated and how much they donated, a formula is used to calculate how much they would have donated if they were perfectly coordinated with each other (ie. took each other's interests into account and did not fall prey to the tragedy of the commons). The difference between amount would-have-donated and amount actually donated for any given project is given to that project as a subsidy from some central pool (see #11 for where the central pool funding could come from). Note that this mechanism focuses on satisfying the values of some community, not on satisfying some given goal regardless of whether or not anyone cares about it. Because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value&quot;&gt;complexity of values&lt;/a&gt; problem, this approach is likely to be much more robust to unknown unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadratic funding has even been tried in real life with considerable success in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html&quot;&gt;recent gitcoin quadratic funding round&lt;/a&gt;. There has also been some incremental progress on improving quadratic funding and similar mechanisms; particularly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553&quot;&gt;pairwise-bounded quadratic funding&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate collusion. There has also been work on specification and implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413&quot;&gt;bribe-resistant&lt;/a&gt; voting technology, preventing users from proving to third parties who they voted for; this prevents many kinds of collusion and bribe attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;16&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decentralized success metrics Problem: come up with and implement a decentralized method for measuring numerical real-world variables ... the system should be able to measure anything that humans can currently reach a rough consensus on (eg. price of an asset, temperature, global CO2 concentration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: &lt;strong&gt;Some progress&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://vitalik.ca/files/hard_problems/happy_face2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now generally just called &quot;the oracle problem&quot;. The largest known instance of a decentralized oracle running is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.augur.net/&quot;&gt;Augur&lt;/a&gt;, which has processed outcomes for millions of dollars of bets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tokencuratedregistry/a-simple-overview-of-token-curated-registries-84e2b7b19a06&quot;&gt;Token curated registries&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tokens.kleros.io/tokens&quot;&gt;Kleros TCR for tokens&lt;/a&gt; are another example. However, these systems still have not seen a real-world test of the forking mechanism (search for &quot;subjectivocracy&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/02/14/subjectivity-exploitability-tradeoff/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) either due to a highly controversial question or due to an attempted 51% attack. There is also research on the oracle problem happening outside of the blockchain space in the form of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring17/compsci590.2/peer_prediction.pdf&quot;&gt;peer prediction&lt;/a&gt;&quot; literature; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00272&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a very recent advancement in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another looming challenge is that people want to rely on these systems to guide transfers of quantities of assets larger than the economic value of the system's native token. In these conditions, token holders in theory have the incentive to collude to give wrong answers to steal the funds. In such a case, the system would fork and the original system token would likely become valueless, but the original system token holders would still get away with the returns from whatever asset transfer they misdirected. Stablecoins (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numberten&quot;&gt;#10&lt;/a&gt;) are a particularly egregious case of this. One approach to solving this would be a system that assumes that altruistically honest data providers do exist, and creating a mechanism to identify them, and only allowing them to churn slowly so that if malicious ones start getting voted in the users of systems that rely on the oracle can first complete an orderly exit. In any case, more development of oracle tech is very much an important problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-problems&quot;&gt;New problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to write the hard problems list again in 2019, some would be a continuation of the above problems, but there would be significant changes in emphasis, as well as significant new problems. Here are a few picks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptographic obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt;: same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numberfour&quot;&gt;#4&lt;/a&gt; above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ongoing work on post-quantum cryptography&lt;/strong&gt;: both hash-based as well as based on post-quantum-secure &quot;structured&quot; mathematical objects, eg. elliptic curve isogenies, lattices...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-collusion infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;: ongoing work and refinement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413&lt;/a&gt;, including adding privacy against the operator, adding multi-party computation in a maximally practical way, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracles&lt;/strong&gt;: same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numbersixteen&quot;&gt;#16&lt;/a&gt; above, but removing the emphasis on &quot;success metrics&quot; and focusing on the general &quot;get real-world data&quot; problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique-human identities&lt;/strong&gt; (or, more realistically, semi-unique-human identities): same as what was written as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numberfifteensic&quot;&gt;#15&lt;/a&gt; above, but with an emphasis on a less &quot;absolute&quot; solution: it should be much harder to get two identities than one, but making it impossible to get multiple identities is both impossible and potentially harmful even if we do succeed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation&lt;/strong&gt;: ongoing improvements are still required for practicality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized governance mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: DAOs are cool, but current DAOs are still very primitive; we can do better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully formalizing responses to PoS 51% attacks&lt;/strong&gt;: ongoing work and refinement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More sources of public goods funding&lt;/strong&gt;: the ideal is to charge for congestible resources inside of systems that have network effects (eg. transaction fees), but doing so in decentralized systems requires public legitimacy; hence this is a social problem along with the technical one of finding possible sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation systems&lt;/strong&gt;: same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html#numbertwelve&quot;&gt;#12&lt;/a&gt; above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, base-layer problems are slowly but surely decreasing, but application-layer problems are only just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
