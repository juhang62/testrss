<title>Sex censorship killed the internet we love</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I pop over to Yahoo News and try the same searches, exhaling relief to see 892 news articles for &quot;porn&quot; from outlets ranging from &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. They're there. It's just that Google's 2018 algorithm upgrade filters out news with the word &quot;porn&quot; in it. Like articles about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/august-ames-porn-suicide-podcast-jon-ronson-lena-misitzis-776110/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;porn performer suicide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allure.com/story/revenge-porn-what-to-do-if-youre-victim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tips for revenge porn victims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.style.yahoo.com/almost-one-five-parents-think-porn-sites-no-age-limit-134125433.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;parents who oppose porn website age-verification&lt;/a&gt; (turns out, today's parents are more afraid of data collection than their kids watching porn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories with the word &quot;porn&quot; in them are important because they're about censorship, sexual health, business trends, sex work, politics, gender and women. They're about people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not for the world's most popular search engine. Google's war on sex took root in 2011 when Google Plus launched with a strict no-sex policy. In 2013, the company enacted a porn purge across Blogger, and Android's Google Keyboard was updated to exclude more than1,400 &quot;inappropriate&quot; words, like &quot;lovemaking,&quot; &quot;condom,&quot; and &quot;STI.&quot; In 2014 Google Play banned sex-themed apps, and an algorithm change in Search destroyed organic results for sex websites. That same year Google made changes to its AdWords policies to prohibit sex-related advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Google launched in 1998, Nerve was one of the internet's leading websites. It was an online magazine about sex with articles and featured erotic artists, busy personals, packed forums. It published terrific sex books by writers and photographers, and had a wildly popular free blogging service (one of the first). From 1997 through the early '00s, Nerve was the fun, exciting, sex-positive place to be and hang out, bursting with creative communities, optimism, and hope that a vital future was being explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, Nerve represented a new era in which we could finally, freely talk about sex, gender, orientation, sex culture -- and exchange ideas. Thanks to Nerve's &quot;literate smut&quot; tagline and ethos, private acts of creation could make tortured people feel valid and whole. People don't make sites like Nerve anymore. No one can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time the internet made you feel good?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I search for art and photography. I am looking for black erotic art, because this kind of visibility matters to me. Like the millions of people who enjoyed Tumblr, I do not want the stereotypes and advertising assault of commercial porn 'tube' sites, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2015/12/98830/ethical-porn-consumer-feminist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;performers say profit unfairly off their hard work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to have a living, breathing museum-of-sex culture online. But in December 2018, Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/07/the-internet-war-on-sex-is-here/&quot;&gt;banned and removed adult content from its service&lt;/a&gt;. Estimated loss: at least 12.5 million blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tumblr started in 2007, it made people feel like the battle to defend erotic art as socially and sexually valid was won, and the necessity of sexual communities was cemented. We found out so much, like that transgender people had hot sex and great erotic art too, and this was ... just incredibly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tumblr erased millions of sex blogs and communities overnight, many lamented that without the website they would've been lost and suicidal trying to figure out their sexuality. When I worked the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfsi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sex crisis call lines&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, before Tumblr, our most common call was from teens in abstinence-only education states who did not know how to prevent sexual disease, infections, injuries or pregnancy — and youth who were terrified they weren't &quot;normal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids we spoke to were afraid and alone. At the call center, we sometimes doubled as a suicide crisis line (the office next to ours was, in fact, the suicide hotline). I can tell you for a fact that Tumblr helped a generation of frightened, isolated kids trying to figure out their sexual identity. Now Tumblr is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/far-right-content-survived-tumblr-purge-36635e6aba4b/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a sex-free haven for white nationalists and Nazis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Ann Powers wrote an essay called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/07.24.97/dirty-art-9730.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Defense of Nasty Art&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; It took progressives to task for not defending rap music because it was &quot;obscene&quot; and sexually graphic. Powers puts it mildly when she states, &quot;Their apprehension makes the fight to preserve freedom of expression seem hollow.&quot; This is an old problem. So it's no surprise that the same websites forbidding, banning, and blocking &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; art content also claim to care about free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Facebook. Artnet &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.artnet.com/market/gray-market-facebook-art-censorship-1235822&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; last March that Facebook's brutal art censorship includes the &lt;em&gt;Venus of Willendorf&lt;/em&gt;, Gustave Courbet's &lt;em&gt;The Origin of the World&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;the banning of Gerhard Richter's blurred rendering of a nude descending a staircase, Evelyne Axell's pop art painting of a woman licking an ice cream cone, and Danish Modernist Edvard Eriksen's beloved, more than 100-year-old public sculpture &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erasure of erotic art, to me, represents a crisis point of culture, of democracy. Art effects the greatest change and empowerment when it's transgressive, scandalous, nude, erotic. Visibility matters. Art is where minds are opened, ideas challenged, viewpoints explored, where people who hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/why-art-has-the-power-to-change-the-world/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have a chance to be changed&lt;/a&gt;, even if for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time the internet gave you hope?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;37.1784&quot; data-caption=&quot;digital brothel&quot; data-credit=&quot;Joachim Beuckelaer (modified) / Jon Turi&quot; data-credit-link-back=&quot;&quot; data-dam-provider=&quot;&quot; data-local-id=&quot;local-1-2554498-1548949396647&quot; data-media-id=&quot;cbd09823-b947-450a-9eec-9961076762d5&quot; data-original-url=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-01/e0825960-256e-11e9-bc57-56fd1fceec75&quot; data-title=&quot;37.1784&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-01%2Fe0825960-256e-11e9-bc57-56fd1fceec75&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=8168c40634101de9c90ce76e349d50ba46d14fb7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I look for the voices of adult performers and sex workers online. The silence is so overwhelming it's suffocating. In 2018, an estimated 42 million sex workers worldwide were evicted from the open internet and essentially went into hiding with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/11/fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers/&quot;&gt;the passage of FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://survivorsagainstsesta.org/documentation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The censorship wave was unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; in internet history. Twitter, Facebook, and all major web service providers immediately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;changed their rules&lt;/a&gt; to tightly police what was posted and messaged about sexual content, by anyone. Entire online communities were kicked off services like Cloudflare (55,000 users of Switter), and hundreds of thousands were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; by the shuttering of safety forums and advertising-screening services. Reddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/30/congress-just-legalized-sex-censorship-what-to-know/&quot;&gt;removed entire communities&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Recently, YouTube banned videos where people &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy3gdb/youtube-banned-erica-lust-in-conversation-with-sex-workers&quot;&gt;simply talk to sex workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices erased are the voices of women. Of gay and straight men, transgender people, the voices of people of color. These populations make up the majority of sex workers. So in America, FOSTA is analogous to how the World Health Organization is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/citizen-lab-netsweeper-internet-filtering-tech-censorship-1.4631243&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;categorized as &quot;pornography&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in web filters used in Kuwait and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law &lt;a href=&quot;https://engadget.com/2018/03/30/congress-just-legalized-sex-censorship-what-to-know/&quot;&gt;legalized sex censorship online&lt;/a&gt;. FOSTA was pushed by Sheryl Sandberg and Facebook — who used their support of FOSTA &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/blog/2018/11/15/how-facebook-sold-out-sex-workers/print&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to appease Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota)&lt;/a&gt;. Thune pushes the false narrative that Facebook censors conservatives and previously said he wanted to regulate the company. FOSTA falsely states that consensual adult sex work is the same as sex trafficking, and was opposed by the Department of Justice, the ACLU, the EFF, numerous online free-speech organizations and actual sex-trafficking organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTA claimed to stop sex trafficking and has utterly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;backfired&lt;/a&gt;. San Francisco just released its &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfranciscopolice.org/compstatreports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 crime statistics&lt;/a&gt;. The only violent crime that increased in San Francisco in 2018 was &quot;human trafficking&quot; — up by an astonishing 170%. These are not sex-worker arrests, which fall under a &quot;vice&quot; subcategory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before FOSTA, the voices of sex workers were readily available. Anyone could ask sex workers who they are, why they make the choices they do and what actual sex workers think about doing sex work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an incredible moment because before free blogging and social-media sites, the only way we heard the voices of sex workers and porn performers was through media outlets that portrayed them as broken rape victims -- or sex-trafficked children. Adults having consensual sex for entertainment were not given a voice unless it validated a narrative of sin, of pain, of regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all the women (and LGBTQ, PoC) who could speak truth to any of this have been driven underground, silenced by algorithms, bans, and FOSTA-empowered &lt;a href=&quot;https://nowtoronto.com/news/sex-work-mens-rights-incel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4chan troll brigades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time you felt free on the internet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Was6455164&quot; data-caption=&quot;starbucks&quot; data-credit=&quot;JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GettyImages&quot; data-mep=&quot;3025067&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-01%2Fb89d2390-24b4-11e9-9cfe-4115257ba1d3&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=e94206593d8c8fe0a28758d86632e0879493d794&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I type. Starbucks is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46393506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filtering&lt;/a&gt; its WiFi with a secret porn blacklist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ev8pg4/facebook-and-patreon-sex-educators-community-guidelines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry/&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook, Instagram, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry/&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; will eject you for getting near a sex business, linking to perceived sex sites, letting the wrong people use your online business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/365330/new-facebook-policy-sparks-fears-of-sex-talk-crackdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned sexual slang&lt;/a&gt;; YouTube bans users for sex ed or LGBTQ content because it might be about sex; Twitter has &lt;a href=&quot;http://phonesexsecrets.info/2018/03/twitter-shadowbanning-aka-the-circles-of-hell.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a mysterious sex-shadowban that no one can get a straight answer on&lt;/a&gt;. Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SexSchoolHub/status/1089176609792376834&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can't tell a potato from a boob&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://titsandsass.com/post-sesta-fosta-self-censoring-for-twitter-reddit-and-other-social-media/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guides on sexual self-censoring&lt;/a&gt; are popular — and necessary. Google Drive &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scans your files and deletes what it believes to be explicit content&lt;/a&gt;. Apple just &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;straight-up hates sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's critical at this harrowing juncture to understand that &lt;strong&gt;apps won, and the open internet lost&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2013, most users accessing the internet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-web-vs-app-usage-statistics-2014-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went to mobile&lt;/a&gt; and stayed that way. People don't actually browse the internet anymore, and we are in a free-speech nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Steve Jobs, adult and sex apps are super-banned from Apple's conservative walled garden. This, combined with Google's censorious push to purge its Play Store of sex has quietly, insidiously formed a censored duopoly controlled by two companies that make Morality in Media very, very happy. Facebook, even though technically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;darknet&lt;/a&gt;, rounded it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Facebook's FOSTA-SESTA law should share credit for its success with Morality in Media (rebranded as &quot;National Center on Sexual Exploitation&quot;), which claimed the victory as well. Morality in Media was also behind Apple's massive &quot;sexy apps&quot; purge in 2010. And Google's 2014 AdWords sex ban was claimed by Morality In Media as a victorious outcome from their pressure and meetings with Google to crack down on porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time you thought of the internet as a weird and wonderful place?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;woman&quot; data-caption=&quot;woman&quot; data-credit=&quot;PORNCHAI SODA via Getty Images&quot; data-credit-link-back=&quot;&quot; data-dam-provider=&quot;&quot; data-local-id=&quot;local-1-5845728-1548871892698&quot; data-media-id=&quot;bc441e75-56a5-4d32-acb3-94105293d829&quot; data-original-url=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-01/3f1c0a30-24ba-11e9-bff1-db3ccf593d86&quot; data-title=&quot;woman&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-01%2F3f1c0a30-24ba-11e9-bff1-db3ccf593d86&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=ba909999763ce6856143a75c6c244bbee7c2c3c2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on the other side now. Like everyone I know, my anxiety climbs as I open any new browser window, check any app or news site. As corporations have scuttled the weird and the wonderful, the taboo voices and forbidden artwork, we wonder only ... what hate will we see today? What attacks await, now that the common rooms and public squares are the playgrounds of racist and anti-sex algorithms, of incels and Nazis, of advertisers and corporations ruling platforms with the iron fist of dated conservative values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is women, people of color, LGBTQ communities, writers and artists who compose the majority population of sex communities, it is everyone who pays the price. It is a curtailing of our freedoms, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who excised the erotic artists and photographers from Tumblr, who decided that sex talk on iTunes podcasts must not titillate, those who implement anti-sex language filters in anything ... they will pay for it, too. Just not in the ways we'd like (their pocketbooks, their conscience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They'll pay with a little piece of their soul when a young intersex girl can't find a healthy representation of pleasurable sexuality for her own body and decides that suicide is better than her oppressor's moralistic illusion of isolation. The ignorance behind the war on sex raged by the Facebooks, the Apples, the Googles, the advertisers, the algorithms, is not only dated, but dangerous. As women fight for control of our reproductive organs, as trans people fight for the right to use a bathroom, the trolls have convinced the gatekeepers that sex must be silent, and 4chan — acting on the urges of right-wing populists — deserves a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what would've happened if the internet could've been allowed to continue without the war on sex. But I know it wouldn't be the terrible place of anxiety and fear we're in now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Design Flaw Behind MacBook Pro’s “Stage Light” Effect [video]</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Touch Bar generation of MacBook Pro always had its quirks, but the thin-at-all-cost design may finally be proving more trouble than it was ever worth. The latest issue to crop up—dubbed “flexgate” by one of our users, Alex—reveals that the compact design for the display’s flex cables is prone to fatigue and failure, leading to a host of display problems that can’t be easily (or cheaply) fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the blog!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fifixit.org%2Fblog%2F12903%2Fflexgate%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDYQ6TgYACITCJTUq_21neACFZnGxAodBNgBXij4HUjpwNPpw_SC2IgB&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fifixit.org%2Fblog%2F12903%2Fflexgate%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://ifixit.org/blog/12903/flexgate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give Apple feedback!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ffeedback%2Fmacbookpro.html&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDYQ6TgYACITCJTUq_21neACFZnGxAodBNgBXij4HUjpwNPpw_SC2IgB&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ffeedback%2Fmacbookpro.html&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.apple.com/feedback/macboo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign the petition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.change.org%2Fp%2Fapple-fix-all-macbook-pro-2016-and-later-with-stage-light-effect-or-backlight-shutdown-flexgate&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDYQ6TgYACITCJTUq_21neACFZnGxAodBNgBXij4HUjpwNPpw_SC2IgB&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.change.org%2Fp%2Fapple-fix-all-macbook-pro-2016-and-later-with-stage-light-effect-or-backlight-shutdown-flexgate&amp;amp;redir_token=TFBXJsfV3Yg4SoUPbhIb1wE_uet8MTU0OTIwOTY5NEAxNTQ5MTIzMjk0&amp;amp;v=iLALpD004Gk&amp;amp;event=video_description&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.change.org/p/apple-fix-al...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out these videos for more information!&lt;br/&gt;MacBook Pro 2016-2018 Flexgate Problem - iBoff RCC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=602Q00G_8rw&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink spf-link&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDYQ6TgYACITCJTUq_21neACFZnGxAodBNgBXij4HQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=602Q0...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macbook Pro 13&quot;/15&quot; 2016-2017 Flexgate.

<title>AWS Drives More Than Half of Amazon&amp;#039;s Operating Income</title>
<link>https://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/aws-drives-more-than-half-of-amazons-operating-income/d/d-id/749196</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/aws-drives-more-than-half-of-amazons-operating-income/d/d-id/749196</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;smalltallline lightergray&quot;&gt;For Amazon, the cloud is the little engine that could. Amazon Web Services comprised just 11% of the company's overall sales in 2018, but delivered more operating income than all other business units combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In financial results delivered Thursday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightreading.com/complink_redirect.asp?vl_id=11381&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services Inc.&lt;/a&gt; drove $7.43 billion sales for the quarter ending December 31, up 45% from $5.11 billion year-over-year. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/amazon-reports-q4-sales-up-20--to-$724b/d/d-id/749194&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Amazon Reports Q4 Sales Up 20% to $72.4B&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the same year-over-year growth rate (Q4 2018 over Q4 2017) for AWS that it saw in the year-ago quarter (Q4 2017 over Q4 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income for AWS was $2.17 billion, up from $1.35 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For calendar 2018, AWS sales were $25.65 billion, up 47% from $17.45 billion year-over-year. Sales growth accelerated in 2018 over 2017 compared with 2017 over 2016, which saw 43% sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;docimage&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/aws-drives-more-than-half-of-amazons-operating-income/d/d-id/749196?image_number=1&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;https://img.lightreading.com/2019/01/749196/1422.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon is cleaning up in the cloud, much as the author's cat cleans itself in this Amazon box. &quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;docimagecaptiontext&quot;&gt;Amazon is cleaning up in the cloud, much as the author's cat cleans itself in this Amazon box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AWS's sales growth to accelerate in that fashion is noteworthy because AWS is by far the leader in cloud market share, ahead of second-ranked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightreading.com/complink_redirect.asp?vl_id=3426&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt; (Nasdaq: MSFT) by a wide margin; accelerating growth speaks to overall strength for AWS and the cloud market in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income for AWS was $7.29 billion in 2018, up from $4.31 billion in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS represents a growing share of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightreading.com/complink_redirect.asp?vl_id=11480&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Amazon.com Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Nasdaq: AMZN)'s overall revenue (by a smidge) -- 11% in 2018 compared with 10% in the previous year, and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 8% in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And AWS is the lion's share of Amazon's operating income: Nearly 58% in the fourth quarter of 2018, and nearly 59% for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Amazon overall, including its mainstay retail business, for the quarter, sales were up 20% to $72.4 billion after a strong holiday season. Net income increased to $3 billion in the fourth quarter, or $6.04 per diluted share, compared with $1.9 billion or $3.75 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the full year, net sales were up 31% to $232.9 billion. Net income increased to $10.1 billion, or $20.14 per diluted share, compared with $3 billion or $6.15 per diluted share in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in its earnings press release. &quot;Alexa was very busy during her holiday season,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first quarter of 2019, Amazon anticipates net sales of $56 billion to $60 billion, up 10-18% year over year. Operating income is expected to be $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon stock traded at $1,634 after hours, down 4.93%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is the second major US cloud provider to report quarterly earnings this month. Microsoft reported that Azure revenues rose 76% Wednesday -- not an apples-to-apples comparison with AWS, as Microsoft breaks out its cloud finances in multiple pieces and reports those pieces mixed in with other business units. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/microsoft-azure-revenues-climb-76-/d/d-id/749163&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure Revenues Climb 76%&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;623d&quot; id=&quot;623d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Chrome 72 for Android is now shipping from the Play Store to all users and this version included Trusted Web Activity (TWA), that in a nutshell is a way to open Chrome in standalone mode (without any toolbar or Chrome UI) within the scope of our own native Android package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ecd&quot; id=&quot;5ecd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let me start saying that the publishing process is not straightforward as it should be (such as “enter your URL” in the Play Console and it’s done). It’s also not a way to use the currently available WebAPK and publish it in the store. It’s a Java API that communicates through services with Chrome and seem to be in the early stages, so there is a lot of manual work to do yet today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ecfa&quot; id=&quot;ecfa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I see this as the first step and I’m sure better tooling will appear soon (maybe from the community) using these now available APIs to create a one-click to store mechanism. But with the current API, it’s possible to ship a PWA’s launcher. I will share my experience in this article for everyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bc4&quot; id=&quot;7bc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For some reason, the feature doesn’t appear as shipped yet in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4857483210260480&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4857483210260480&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chrome Platform Status&lt;/a&gt; and there is still no updated documentation available more than the one published 15 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40fe&quot; id=&quot;40fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UPDATE 2/1&lt;/strong&gt;: Paul Kinlan, Lead of Chrome DevRel @ Google confirmed TWA was shipped and docs are just delayed&lt;/p&gt;


Here you can watch a video of Pete Le Page explaining TWAs a year ago.
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1faa&quot; id=&quot;1faa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Why publishing a PWA in the store?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df39&quot; id=&quot;df39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Is the Web Platform, Max! Why do we want to use the Store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2b05&quot; id=&quot;2b05&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Well, it’s a long discussion, but I’ve been doing consulting with small and big companies for years, and when talking about PWA investment, the store is a recurrent demand. “My users will look for my app in the Store”, “I already have a native app that I want to stop doing, but I don’t want to lose my users”, “I need to access a native API”, or “I want to monetize my PWA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;764d&quot; id=&quot;764d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From now, publishing your PWA in the Store -as well as from the browser- will be possible. Of course, it’s an opt-in operation. The Play Store is not emulating the Microsoft Store: your PWA won’t be listed in the store if you don’t compile your own APK, and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e25a&quot; id=&quot;e25a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Advantages over standard PWA installation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;268a&quot; id=&quot;268a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Despite the new distribution mechanism and people finding your app within the store (and even in Google’s search under “Apps”), there are some things we may be able to do with a PWA in the Store, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;06da&quot; id=&quot;06da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Offer a Home Screen Widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e6f3&quot; id=&quot;e6f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Offer a wear OS companion app or Android Auto extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d959&quot; id=&quot;d959&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Have background services accessing native features (communication with the PWA is still limited — more on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a757&quot; id=&quot;a757&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Monetize the App — limited today, more on this later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;27d7&quot; id=&quot;27d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Have some native screens mixed with PWA content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7e70&quot; id=&quot;7e70&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Distribute more than one PWA icon in the Launcher and/or home screen pointing to different URLs (within the same host)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fcae&quot; id=&quot;fcae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Better internationalization support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;775d&quot; id=&quot;775d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;What’s new here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*7KPnXlxFRP0acjs_4Yzk_w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1182&quot; data-height=&quot;424&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*7KPnXlxFRP0acjs_4Yzk_w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7KPnXlxFRP0acjs_4Yzk_w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There were already some PWAs in the Store, but now they will be much easier to produce and publish
&lt;p name=&quot;e18a&quot; id=&quot;e18a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In Google Play Store there are already some PWAs published such as Google Maps Go, Instagram Lite or Twitter Lite. The first one is using some kind of a private pre-TWA version, and the last two are using a WebView that while not ideal, it was the only way to do something like this before TWAs. These apps are adding a lot of native code for some things such as notifications. We want to publish PWAs as web developers, we don’t want to write a lot of Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f4e&quot; id=&quot;8f4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;TWA is a special mode on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chrome Custom Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, a solution available to native Android apps from Chrome 45 to open an In-App browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;c1bc&quot; id=&quot;c1bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Is TWA a Hybrid framework, similar to Cordova?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71a4&quot; id=&quot;71a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;No. With Cordova or other hybrid solutions, you are typically shipping your web resources (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.) within your APK package. Also, the engine is different and isolated from the users’ browser, so no session or cache sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*I0lE3Qj-UPoPG7ztfNHr5w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;5000&quot; data-height=&quot;2880&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*I0lE3Qj-UPoPG7ztfNHr5w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*I0lE3Qj-UPoPG7ztfNHr5w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This is how a PWA looks like with Trusted Web Activity (Starbucks actually didn’t have one yet). I don’t see the theme-color implemented yet
&lt;p name=&quot;b8aa&quot; id=&quot;b8aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;With Trusted Web Activity you don’t need to package any resource file from your PWA (only native components, in case you want them); all your resources will be downloaded and updated on the fly from your Service Worker. Your PWA will still be rendered with the installed Chrome version, sharing all storage, cache, and sessions with the browser. Therefore, if your user has a session on your website opened when the user installs the app from the Play Store, she will still be logged in. The user is just installing a shortcut to Chrome using a special mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7da3&quot; id=&quot;7da3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Development options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;429f&quot; id=&quot;429f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;For creating an Android Package using TWA we will first need &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, the options available are kind of experimental and documented only with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;open source examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Chrome GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac97&quot; id=&quot;ac97&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We can develop apps with TWA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e3f7&quot; id=&quot;e3f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Using a high-level Java Support Library&lt;/strong&gt; provided by the Chrome team: in this case, you don’t need to write any Java or Kotlin native code; you create an Android Studio project (or clone the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), set up some metadata in AndroidManifest.xml from your Web App Manifest and you are done. &lt;br/&gt;The framework will provide the connection with TWA and optional abilities to create a Settings entry in the Android device and to make Web Push notifications available. The framework is currently available as a support library in a temporary Jitpack repository. I guess that’s not going to be the final location for this library in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d9db&quot; id=&quot;d9db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Using the Trusted Web Activity manually&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have experience developing Android apps with Java or Kotlin, you can just plug your PWA manually into your app. That means you can have some native activities and at one point you can open the Trusted Web Activity with your PWA. In this case, I suggest analyzing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client/tree/master/customtabs/src/android/support/customtabs/trusted&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client/tree/master/customtabs/src/android/support/customtabs/trusted&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Support Library&lt;/a&gt; to understand how to connect to Chrome from your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;1685&quot; id=&quot;1685&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Spreading the Manifest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c7d&quot; id=&quot;7c7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;A PWA in the App Store won’t use the Web App Manifest for defining how your app runs; we will need to copy some of those values manually. Icons will be taken from the “res” folder like any other native Android App, orientation lock should be defined in AndroidManifest’s activity entry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9142&quot; id=&quot;9142&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you are using the Java Support library, a splash screen might be created for you automatically but other properties from the manifest won’t be used. In fact, in my testing, I couldn’t see the theme-color being applied yet when my PWA is on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e6ee&quot; id=&quot;e6ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;URL Validation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;233b&quot; id=&quot;233b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;TWAs will work only if we digital handshake our domain with our app. This is a mechanism known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Digital Assets Links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That will make a trusted relationship between your host and your APK, proving that you are the owner of the PWA and that you won’t be publishing PWAs in the Play Store that you don’t own. It also makes a digital link between your website and your native app that in theory can let them share private data (but doesn’t seem to be possible with today’s TWA API).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e4de&quot; id=&quot;e4de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With Digital Asset Links you must serve under your PWA’s domain a file in the URL &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;your-domain&amp;gt;/.well-known/assetlinks.json.&lt;/em&gt; That JSON file will contain information about your Android package (such as the package ID) and a hash of your app’s certificate that you can get running a command in the terminal. Your Android package will have a counterpart setting the host URL. There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online validator tool&lt;/a&gt; available to check if everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b66f&quot; id=&quot;b66f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you don’t do the handshake, TWAs won’t be activated and your app will just use normal Chrome Custom Tabs with a Chrome user interface similar to when your PWA has &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;display: minimal-ui&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not completely sure but I guess the Play Store might reject apps that are just pointing to normal Custom Tabs and not validated TWAs. I’m not completely sure yet when Chrome is doing the Digital Asset Link check; if it’s being done on every access to the app before opening it as a TWA it might be a performance problem. I guess a cache will be possible, and also the Play Store might check this before accepting the app. We’ll see if future documentation gives us clarity on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b280&quot; id=&quot;b280&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;There is a (not so simple) mechanism to bypass the Digital Asset Link certification process for development purposes, explained below in this article.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b6ee&quot; id=&quot;b6ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Publishing your App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;adc0&quot; id=&quot;adc0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;To publish your PWA shortcut using TWAs you will need to follow all the Google Play Store rules. Check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Developer Policy Center&lt;/a&gt; for more information. You will also need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Developer Publisher&lt;/a&gt; account paying a one-time fee of USD $25 and create metadata, screenshots and marketing material for your app.&lt;/p&gt;

To publish in the Google Play Store you must accept developer agreement and pay a one time USD $25 registration fee
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5c48&quot; id=&quot;5c48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;579b&quot; id=&quot;579b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;When you are done creating your APK (Android Native Package) from Android Studio and you already have a Developer Console account, you must create a production APK and sign it with a self-created key that you create within Android Studio tools. You might also want to check &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;App Signing by Google Play&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the process in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5d7f&quot; id=&quot;5d7f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Google Play Console&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ae9&quot; id=&quot;0ae9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There are no special rules or processes to upload these apps to the Play Store, but the Revision team might detect that you are using TWAs and will do a check that 1) Digital Assets Link is enabled and validated, and 2) the URL is passing the PWA criteria (mostly for a Service Worker fetch event handler).&lt;/p&gt;

Filling a lot of metadata and graphic assets will be mandatory for publishing your PWA in the Google Play Store
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f375&quot; id=&quot;f375&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Updating your App&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a561&quot; id=&quot;a561&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;You don’t need to upload your app again if you change web content — unless you change the app completely as per the store rules. You will continue updating your app through Service Workers and new deploys to your server. You will have to create and upload another APK only if you want to change metadata, native code, or icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6f15&quot; id=&quot;6f15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f204&quot; id=&quot;f204&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m seeing a list of possible limitations regarding the platform today, but it’s just a start and I hope we will see improvements over new versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4336&quot; id=&quot;4336&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;PWAs in Subfolders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;452a&quot; id=&quot;452a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;If you publish your PWA in a subfolder of a host, it seems to be a couple of issues here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;db65&quot; id=&quot;db65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Digital Asset Link connects the whole domain, not just a folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2f1b&quot; id=&quot;2f1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The current Support Library seems to handle as an Intent (Link Capturing) the whole host, even if your PWA is in a subfolder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;4884&quot; id=&quot;4884&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;No internal apps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2aac&quot; id=&quot;2aac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;While this is a restriction of the Play Store itself (you can’t publish intranet apps, or apps that are just for you or your company), you might want to use TWAs and create APKs that you will deploy outside of the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af25&quot; id=&quot;af25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That won’t be possible as Digital Asset Link works only with public URLs because Chrome needs to verify we own the domain, and that’s is not possible with internal URLs yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;acfd&quot; id=&quot;acfd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First Load experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;477e&quot; id=&quot;477e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The first time you open the recently installed app, you don’t have any actual files from your app (Service Worker wasn’t registered yet — unless, the user visited the PWA before), so if you are offline you will end up with a blank white screen. I think trying to warm up Chrome after installation somehow will be useful in future versions. If you are using TWA APIs instead of the Support Library you might be able to detect this situation and inform the user properly using native APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;3d46&quot; id=&quot;3d46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Calling native code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4225&quot; id=&quot;4225&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There is already a bi-directional channel to communicate the TWA Server (Chrome) and the TWA Client (our APK). That channel is currently being used to send Push Messages and show them as being part of our native app and not Chrome, but nothing else yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5367&quot; id=&quot;5367&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There is a potential here to bridge native code and JavaScript code without too much effort and let our PWAs access native code, similar to what happens when we publish an APPX with a PWA for Microsoft Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;04c0&quot; id=&quot;04c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m seeing a future version with a way to register Java/Kotlin classes to the TWA Client so we can actually call them with a JavaScript API when our PWA is rendered in TWA mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;465b&quot; id=&quot;465b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Today, the only way to execute native code is to use Intents to open other native Activities and back opening TWA sending and receiving arguments through URIs parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;54bc&quot; id=&quot;54bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Also, you can create some kind of web server, or WebSocket server in native code running on a Service and let the PWA talk to it, but it’s kind of weird, complicated and maybe battery consuming. But there is a whole new world that might open now. Let’s see what the community creates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6f62&quot; id=&quot;6f62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Monetization with the Play Store&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;98fb&quot; id=&quot;98fb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;If your app is not free to download, there will be no easy way to validate that the user has actually paid for it (at the end, your content is just a URL); also if you have digital assets or subscriptions that you’d like to sell using the Play Store wallet, it will be a challenge to make it work without having an actual bridge to native code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;89dc&quot; id=&quot;89dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Debugging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a87&quot; id=&quot;0a87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I’m not sure if it’s a bug or something on my development environment but remote debugging the Service Worker from the TWA is not working. I can inspect the window’s context, but not the Service Worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;21b6&quot; id=&quot;21b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Other engines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac33&quot; id=&quot;ac33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;TWAs work only with Chrome today, but the API might be also cloned by other browsers, such as Samsung Internet, Edge or Firefox in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6a2&quot; id=&quot;e6a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What happens if the user has an older version of Chrome and installs the app from the Play Store? In this case, your PWA will appear as a Chrome Custom Tab, not in a completely standalone mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*eBeSY4-QjocHEvFs7VafAw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eBeSY4-QjocHEvFs7VafAw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Google Maps Go in the Play Store was already using something similar to TWA specifying Chrome as a requirement
&lt;p name=&quot;65ac&quot; id=&quot;65ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;What happens if the user doesn’t have Chrome at all? As of today using the Support Library, your app won’t work at all. If you are using the TWA API on your own Java/Kotlin code you might be able to detect browser availability and load an alternate solution, such as a WebView or opening the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ba2&quot; id=&quot;2ba2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While it’s not so common to see Android devices without Chrome, there are some devices without it by default, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/16/google-changes-android-licenses-after-eu-antitrust/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/16/google-changes-android-licenses-after-eu-antitrust/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new devices in Europe shipping without Chrome by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;122a&quot; id=&quot;122a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Other platforms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8436&quot; id=&quot;8436&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;PWAs won’t work on wear OS (watches), but I’m not completely sure what happens on other Android platforms. I will guess a probably not yet, but I’ll test it for a next article. I’m talking about Android TV or even Chromebooks with Play Store. In the meantime, if you didn’t test it, it might be a good idea to disable those platforms in your store listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;967d&quot; id=&quot;967d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conflicting with WebAPK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2dc6&quot; id=&quot;2dc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;If you already installed the PWA from Chrome, you already have installed an APK for that URL signed by the Play Store, but that won’t stop the store to list your App and let the user also install it. The same on the other way: having the app installed from the store won’t stop Chrome to offer the user to “Add” it from the browser. I think this might be avoided in the future if the WebAPK also has a Digital Asset Link somehow, or if we can match WebAPK’s app’s id, but I don’t see this happening soon. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

Two Starbucks Apps running at the same time: WebAPK and our own APK
&lt;p name=&quot;78e1&quot; id=&quot;78e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You can stop Chrome to offer WebAPK and offer your store listing app instead by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#related_applications-member&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#related_applications-member&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;related_applications attribute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;prefer_related_applications&lt;/em&gt; Web App Manifest’s attributes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/12/get-installed-related-apps&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/12/get-installed-related-apps&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get Installed Related Apps API&lt;/a&gt; might help in the future with this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;89e0&quot; id=&quot;89e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Creating your first PWApk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7ede&quot; id=&quot;7ede&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Yes, I know, I’ve just invented the PWApk word, but it doesn’t sound too bad, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;75e5&quot; id=&quot;75e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;A few years ago I did a video course on &lt;a href=&quot;http://firt.mobi/nwa&quot; data-href=&quot;http://firt.mobi/nwa&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Native Web Apps for Android&lt;/a&gt;, that while not exactly what you need to do for PWAs, it will help web developers understand the Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Wp52tbCmXTH044OPWpj_IA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2408&quot; data-height=&quot;882&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Wp52tbCmXTH044OPWpj_IA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Wp52tbCmXTH044OPWpj_IA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The simplest way to make a TWA-based APK is to clone the SVGOMG repository sample from ChromeLabs GitHub repository
&lt;p name=&quot;46af&quot; id=&quot;46af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;clone the git repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or start a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2586&quot; id=&quot;2586&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In our case, we will start a new project just to understand and explain what’s going on with the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5865&quot; id=&quot;5865&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Create a new Project in Android Studio and select “No Activity” as we will use just a Trusted Web Activity provided by the Support Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*ibo8V2V9VYdA2TOTyb5Pmg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1798&quot; data-height=&quot;1446&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*ibo8V2V9VYdA2TOTyb5Pmg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ibo8V2V9VYdA2TOTyb5Pmg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We start with an empty project
&lt;p name=&quot;7a67&quot; id=&quot;7a67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Fill the details, picking a name (we will override this later), and a Package name. The package name is important as it will be the ID of our app in the Android OS and also within the store. I recommend using your PWA’s host in reserve order and an optional name after, such as: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;com.mypwa.calculator&lt;/em&gt; if your PWA is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;https://mypwa.com/calculator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56fc&quot; id=&quot;56fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;API 19 (Android 4.4) as a base looks good, as it seems that is going to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-android-dropping-support-android-4-1-4-3-jelly-bean/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-android-dropping-support-android-4-1-4-3-jelly-bean/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimum version required for Chrome soon&lt;/a&gt;. Some things on TWA will work only from API 23 (Android 6.0) but the Support Library will take care of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*-D5lTeMrQ5CpLTuBJT6Pdg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1802&quot; data-height=&quot;1448&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*-D5lTeMrQ5CpLTuBJT6Pdg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-D5lTeMrQ5CpLTuBJT6Pdg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Picking the minimum API level will limit the devices that will see our PWA in the Google Play Store
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a403&quot; id=&quot;a403&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Adding Dependency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e02e&quot; id=&quot;e02e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The next step is to add the TWA Support Library as a dependency, so we will go and open two files with the name build.gradle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*q1blLHIj7854tV2JF7rZfQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;908&quot; data-height=&quot;218&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*q1blLHIj7854tV2JF7rZfQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q1blLHIj7854tV2JF7rZfQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There are two gradle configuration files, one for the project and one for the Android app
&lt;p name=&quot;35f7&quot; id=&quot;35f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Starting with the Project build.gradle, we will add under allprojects &amp;gt; repositories, the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;b589&quot; id=&quot;b589&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
maven { url &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;&quot;https://jitpack.io&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0479&quot; id=&quot;0479&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Next step, we open the Module build.gradle and we add under dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;0cc7&quot; id=&quot;0cc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
implementation &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;'com.github.GoogleChrome:custom-tabs-client:e446d08014'&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;c927&quot; id=&quot;c927&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Configuring the TWA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2b90&quot; id=&quot;2b90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The next step is to stay under the Module’s build.gradle file and setup the PWA settings for the Trusted Web Activity, under defaultConfig we will add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;61d3&quot; id=&quot;61d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
manifestPlaceholders = [&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pre-em&quot;&gt;        &lt;/em&gt;hostName: &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;app.starbucks.com&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;defaultUrl: &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;https://app.starbucks.com&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;launcherName: &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pre-em&quot;&gt;        &lt;/em&gt;assetStatements: '[{ &quot;relation&quot;: [&quot;delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls&quot;], ' +&lt;br/&gt;'&quot;target&quot;: {&quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;web&quot;, &quot;site&quot;: &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;https://app.starbucks.com&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;}}]'&lt;br/&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f59b&quot; id=&quot;f59b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;In this case, I’ll use the Starbucks PWA as an example. The assetStatements key is the one that will need information from the Digital Asset Link process. We’ll skip that part for development purposes. The property with the name &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;launcherName&lt;/em&gt; should match &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;short_name&lt;/em&gt; in the Web App Manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;3ec8&quot; id=&quot;3ec8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Configuring the Manifest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;adec&quot; id=&quot;adec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Android apps have their own manifest and they won’t use our Web App Manifest, that file is under app &amp;gt; manifests in your Android project explorer as is called AndroidManifest.xml. You will find a self-closed Application XML element there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*7DBlFQYJPjXUIA2KQG_c9w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1570&quot; data-height=&quot;542&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*7DBlFQYJPjXUIA2KQG_c9w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7DBlFQYJPjXUIA2KQG_c9w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The default Android Manifest file we have now
&lt;p name=&quot;57f1&quot; id=&quot;57f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There, we can change the value of android:label with &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;${launcherName}&lt;/strong&gt; to use the launcherName we set before in the metadata, so we will have one single source of truth for the app’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8fa3&quot; id=&quot;8fa3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The next step is to setup this file, starting with opening the &amp;lt;application&amp;gt; tag so we can add some children inside that will look like the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;ee5e&quot; id=&quot;ee5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;meta-data&lt;br/&gt;android:name=&quot;asset_statements&quot;&lt;br/&gt;android:value=&quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;${assetStatements}&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;activity android:name=&quot;android.support.customtabs.trusted.LauncherActivity&quot;&lt;br/&gt;android:label=&quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;${launcherName}&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;android.support.customtabs.trusted.DEFAULT_URL&quot;&lt;br/&gt;android:value=&quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;${defaultUrl}&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.VIEW&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.BROWSABLE&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;data android:scheme=&quot;https&quot;&lt;br/&gt;android:host=&quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--pre-strong&quot;&gt;${hostName}&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/activity&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3191&quot; id=&quot;3191&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;The code below will set up the TWA using the Support Library, the Intent Filter so your app will capture links to your PWA and the Digital Asset Link. I will skip the details on what’s going on there from an Android app’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*uUN5juiCIraYfl4kJGkIhg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1696&quot; data-height=&quot;218&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*uUN5juiCIraYfl4kJGkIhg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uUN5juiCIraYfl4kJGkIhg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It’s time to Sync
&lt;p name=&quot;d899&quot; id=&quot;d899&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;At this point, you will have to make Android Studio take all your changes by clicking on “Sync Now.” If everything is correct, you won’t get any errors at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;46de&quot; id=&quot;46de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Icon replacement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13b8&quot; id=&quot;13b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now our app uses just a default android icon, we should replace all the files available in app&amp;gt;res&amp;gt;mipmap in different subfolders for different pixel densities. There are two versions, square and rounded icons. Rounded icons are new in Android 7.1 and if you want to skip them remove the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;android:roundIcon&lt;/em&gt; reference in the AndroidManifest.xml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*IdXjA1DJquyKC3z9jxFyjQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2598&quot; data-height=&quot;992&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*IdXjA1DJquyKC3z9jxFyjQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IdXjA1DJquyKC3z9jxFyjQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We need to manually take icons from our Manifest and copy them in the mipmap subfolders with the right name
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e03c&quot; id=&quot;e03c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Theme adjustment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;37c3&quot; id=&quot;37c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Finally, we should open app/res/values/styles.xml and make some changes to the theme so it will look like a PWA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;f3e2&quot; id=&quot;f3e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ready to test?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bdc&quot; id=&quot;8bdc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We are ready to test our PWApk, but before that, we need to set up development TWA mode for Chrome in our Android testing device or emulator (with Chrome 72+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8c8b&quot; id=&quot;8c8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Setting up Chrome&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;984e&quot; id=&quot;984e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Check that you have Chrome stable version 72 and open &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;chrome://flags&lt;/em&gt;. Search for “Enable command line on non-rooted devices,” and enable the flag. You will have to restart Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2910&quot; id=&quot;2910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Next, we need to set up Chrome to bypass Digital Asset Link for the host we want to test, in our example: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;app.starbucks.com&lt;/strong&gt;. (I’m sorry Starbucks, but we love you, you know that LOL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4738&quot; id=&quot;4738&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To change command line arguments for Chrome on Android we need to write a text file in the Android’s file system. The simplest way to do it is through &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;adb&lt;/strong&gt; (android debug bridge) that has to be in the path (google that if it’s not there) and execute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;5596&quot; id=&quot;5596&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
adb shell cat /data/local/tmp/chrome-command-line _ - disable-digital-asset-link-verification-for-url=&quot;https://app.starbucks.com&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;300a&quot; id=&quot;300a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/master/enable-debug.sh&quot; data-href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa/master/enable-debug.sh&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;simple bash script&lt;/a&gt; available in the Chrome’s sample to use if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*frxk7ONiBglW83Qnf-u6qQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;5000&quot; data-height=&quot;2880&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*frxk7ONiBglW83Qnf-u6qQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*frxk7ONiBglW83Qnf-u6qQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We need to stop Chrome to take our new dev setting
&lt;p name=&quot;a2d1&quot; id=&quot;a2d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And now, we need to restart Chrome. But not just killing the app from the multitask window. Go the Settings / Apps / Chrome and Terminate the whole process (Force Stop). I had to do this a couple of times before having it ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

The warning stating that the flag is enabled
&lt;p name=&quot;c4b6&quot; id=&quot;c4b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If it’s done, then every time you open chrome you will get a warning now about that flag we enabled and if you run your app from Android Studio you will finally get your PWA up and running in standalone more under your APK’s icon and name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;21b1&quot; id=&quot;21b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fdb8&quot; id=&quot;fdb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The idea that we can now publish PWAs in the Google Play Store is really a game changer. It seems we are in the early stages of the API right now and we definitely need a higher level solution for this. I really want to see a tool to enter our PWA’s URL and get an APK from it. It won’t be simply because of the Digital Asset Link verification system. Only the Play Store can do that just by using the same WebAPK they are generating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9e8&quot; id=&quot;c9e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was questioning if &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@firt/is-there-a-cold-war-between-android-and-chrome-because-of-pwas-e50a7471056c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@firt/is-there-a-cold-war-between-android-and-chrome-because-of-pwas-e50a7471056c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google was approving or not TWAs&lt;/a&gt;, so they are removing the suspicious at least of the TWA part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;210f&quot; id=&quot;210f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s take Chrome 72 TWA as the first step of a long journey!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One of the Biggest At-Home DNA Testing Companies Is Working with the FBI</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/family-tree-dna-fbi-investigative-genealogy-privacy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/family-tree-dna-fbi-investigative-genealogy-privacy</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;66.832445233866&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family Tree DNA, one of the largest private genetic testing companies whose home-testing kits enable people to trace their ancestry and locate relatives, is working with the FBI and allowing agents to search its vast genealogy database in an effort to solve violent crime cases, BuzzFeed News has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and local law enforcement have used public genealogy databases for more than two years to solve cold cases, including the landmark capture of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/serial-killer-dna-testing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspected Golden State Killer&lt;/a&gt;, but the cooperation with Family Tree DNA and the FBI marks the first time a private firm has agreed to voluntarily allow law enforcement access to its database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the FBI does not have the ability to freely browse genetic profiles in the library, the move is sure to raise privacy concerns about law enforcement gaining the ability to look for DNA matches, or more likely, relatives linked by uploaded user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For law enforcement officials, the access could be the key to unlocking murders and rapes that have gone cold for years, opening up what many argue is the greatest investigative tactic since the advent of DNA identification. For privacy advocates, the FBI’s new ability to match the genetic profiles from a private company could set a dangerous precedent in a world where DNA test kits have become as common as a Christmas stocking stuffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based company, which touts itself as a pioneer in the genetic testing industry and the first to offer a direct-to-consumer test kit, disclosed its relationship with the FBI to BuzzFeed News on Thursday, saying in a statement that allowing access “would help law enforcement agencies solve violent crimes faster than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;171.09030100334&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Family Tree does not have a contract with the FBI, the firm has agreed to test DNA samples and upload the profiles to its database on a case-by-case basis since last fall, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its work with the FBI is “a very new development, which started with one case last year and morphed,” she said. To date, the company has cooperated with the FBI on fewer than 10 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Family Tree database is free to access and can be used by anyone with a DNA profile to upload, not just paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detectives across the country desperate for leads, investigative genealogy has become the newest frontier for law enforcement agencies. By uploading DNA collected from a crime scene to genealogy databases, detectives have been able to locate distant relatives of suspected serial killers and rapists. Then, assembling a genealogical tree from that information, they have worked to identify suspects of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, investigators have limited their searches to public and free databases, where genealogy enthusiasts had willingly uploaded the data knowing it could be accessible to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, under the previously undisclosed cooperation with Family Tree, the FBI has gained access to more than a million DNA profiles from the company, most of which were uploaded before the company’s customers had any knowledge of its relationship with the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the concerns over privacy, officials at Family Tree touted their work with the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without realizing it [Family Tree DNA founder and CEO Bennett Greenspan] had inadvertently created a platform that, nearly two decades later, would help law enforcement agencies solve violent crimes faster than ever,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Family Tree said customers could decide to opt out of any familial matching, which would prevent their profiles from being searchable by the FBI. But by doing so, customers would also be unable to use one of the key features of the service: finding possible relatives through DNA testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who used the service not knowing the FBI had access to it, the news was concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in all, I feel violated, I feel they have violated my trust as a customer,” Leah Larkin, a genetic genealogist based in Livermore, California, told BuzzFeed News. “I’ve got to decide whether I want to opt out of matching or delete my kits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larkin, one of the administrators of a Facebook genealogy group with about 50,000 members, predicted that enthusiasts will be split, from those who will be fine with law enforcement gaining access to their DNA profiles to others who will be outraged by the invasion of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to cause a lot of uproar,” she said. “We’re going to get the full spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement’s use of public databases had already caused concern from privacy advocates who noted that although users submit their DNA profiles willingly, relatives identified by their genetic code have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are nearing a de-facto national DNA database,” Natalie Ram, an assistant law professor at the University of Baltimore who specializes in bioethics and criminal justice, told BuzzFeed News. “We don’t choose our genetic relatives, and I cannot sever my genetic relation to them. There’s nothing voluntary about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others aired similar concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would be very against Family Tree DNA allowing law enforcement to have open access to their DNA database,” Debbie Kennett, a British genealogy enthusiast and honorary research associate at University College London said. “I don’t think it’s right for law enforcement to use a database without the informed consent of the consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2018, the company changed its terms of service to allow law enforcement to use the database to identify suspects of “a violent crime,” such as homicide or sexual assault, and to identify the remains of a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Greenspan, the president and founder of Gene by Gene, Family Tree’s parent company, said the firm would not be violating its terms of privacy to its customers, despite the FBI’s access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We came to the conclusion that if law enforcement created accounts, with the same level of access to the database as the standard FamilyTreeDNA user, they would not be violating user privacy and confidentiality,” Greenspan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, company officials told BuzzFeed News that despite the FBI’s access to the database, agents would not be able to obtain more information than what is accessible to normal users of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order for the FBI to obtain any additional information, they would have to provide a valid court-order such as a subpoena or search warrant,” Greenspan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family Tree had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/family-tree-dna-subpoena-golden-state-killer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already faced a warrant for information during the search for the Golden State Killer&lt;/a&gt; when its parent company was served a federal subpoena in March 2017 for “limited information” on an account. That profile, in the end, did not lead to the arrest, but shows law enforcement has been willing to take bold steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;133.71764048085&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the arrangement, the company has also agreed to test DNA evidence for the FBI in its private laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement had been toying with investigative genealogy for more than a year, but the practice gained international attention in April 2018 when detectives used the technique, scanning a public database, to find a distant relative that led to the eventual arrest of the suspected Golden State Killer, who killed 13 people and raped dozens of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA-matching technique was an untested long shot then, and immediately raised questions about privacy, ethics, and legal implications in criminal investigations, yet law enforcement officials have been eager to learn and adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI, in particular, quietly assembled a small but active unit focused on employing the method to crack some of the nation’s most difficult cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by an attorney in the FBI’s Los Angeles office, Steve Kramer, the FBI’s Investigative Genealogy Unit has since been deployed across the country, aiding police departments in utilizing the technique and instructing officers on how to employ the new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the new great big revolution in law enforcement,” Paul Holes, a retired investigator with the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office, who led the team that cracked the Golden State Killer case, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s the first big one since the implementation of DNA 20-some years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last nine months, police in Maryland, Washington, California, and Florida have solved cases using the method after consulting with the FBI’s Investigative Genealogy Unit, a federal law enforcement official told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with the technique also argue that despite privacy concerns, few would be opposed to helping catch a homicide or rape suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one informal &lt;a href=&quot;http://ggi2013.blogspot.com/2018/11/how-do-you-feel-about-your-dna-being.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey conducted by genealogist&lt;/a&gt; Maurice Gleeson, of people involved in genealogy in the US and Europe, 85% of respondents said they were comfortable with law enforcement using their DNA profiles to catch a serial killer or rapist. Ninety-six percent of those who participated in the survey had taken a DNA test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI declined to offer details regarding how many cases the new unit has participated in, or the makeup of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We obviously assisted other investigations that have had successful results,” Laura Eimiller, spokesperson for the FBI’s office in Los Angeles, told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency declined to comment on its cooperation with Family Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the company, it currently has 1,021,774 records in its database. By comparison, Ancestry.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://thednageek.com/dna-tests/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is believed to have a database&lt;/a&gt; of about 10 million profiles, while 23andMe counts about 5 million accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Family Tree touts one of the largest Y-DNA databases in the world, which can specifically trace a person’s patrilineal ancestry, and can be a valuable tool for investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other DNA testing companies, Family Tree has touted its protection of customer privacy. Earlier this year, the company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2019-01-07/best-dna-testing-kits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranked by US News&lt;/a&gt; as the best kit for “research and strict privacy,” and PC World &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/3317567/data-center-cloud/best-dna-kits.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;named it the best kit for privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenspan, in the statement, said that won’t change despite the FBI’s involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with law enforcement to process DNA samples from the scene of a violent crime or identifying an unknown victim does not change our policy never to sell or barter our customers’ private information with a third party,” Greenspan said. “Our policy remains fully intact and in force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter Aldhous contributed reporting to this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A combination of DNS problems and automated scripts were to blame, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/30/azure_sql_delete/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft deleted several Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) databases in Azure, holding live customer information. TDE databases dynamically encrypt the information they store, decrypting it when customers access it. Keeping the data encrypted at rest stops an intruder with access to the database from reading the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are different approaches to encrypting these tables, many Azure users store their own encryption keys in Microsoft’s Key Vault encryption key management system, in a process called Bring Your Own Key (BYOK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deletions were automated, triggered by a script that drops TDE database tables when their corresponding keys can no longer be accessed in the Key Vault, explained Microsoft in a letter reportedly sent to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company quickly restored the tables from a five-minute snapshot backup, but that meant any transactions that customers had processed within five minutes of the table drop would have to be dealt with manually. In this case, customers would have to raise a support ticket and ask for the database copy to be renamed to the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;sophos_ad-24&quot; class=&quot;widget sophos-inline-ad sophos_widget_ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why were the systems accessing the TDE tables unable to access the Key Vault? The answer stems from a far bigger issue for Microsoft and its Azure customers this week. An outage struck the cloud service worldwide on Tuesday, causing a range of problems. These included intermittent access to Office 365 in which users had only half a chance of logging on. Broader Azure cloud resources were also down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was, in turn, down to a DNS outage, according to Microsoft’s Azure status page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary root cause: Engineers identified a DNS issue with an external DNS provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigation: DNS services were failed over to an alternative DNS provider which mitigated the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/656926/centurylink-dns-issue-blamed-microsoft-365-services-outage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reports suggested&lt;/a&gt; that this DNS outage came from CenturyLink, which provides DNS services to Microsoft. The company had suffered a software defect, it had said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows what can go wrong when cloud-based systems are interconnected and automated enough to allow cascading failures. A software defect at a DNS provider indirectly led to the deletion of live customer information thanks to a lack of human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CenturyLink seems to be experiencing serial DNS problems lately. The company, which completed its $34bn acquisition of large network operator Level 3 in late 2017, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://totaluptime.com/major-centurylink-network-outage-to-close-2018/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;suffered a DNS outage in December&lt;/a&gt; that reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/28/18159110/centurylink-internet-911-outage-fcc-investigating&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;affected emergency services&lt;/a&gt;, sparking an FCC investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure users can at least take comfort in the fact that Microsoft is offering multiple months of free Azure service for affected parties.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What we&amp;#039;ve learned about hiring engineering managers</title>
<link>https://circleci.com/blog/what-we-ve-learned-about-hiring-engineering-managers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://circleci.com/blog/what-we-ve-learned-about-hiring-engineering-managers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/media/EngineeringManagers.png&quot; alt=&quot;CircleCI Engineering Managers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we have made some critical shifts in our understanding of what we believe makes a great engineering manager at CircleCI, and learned a lot about our needs and values as an organization along the way. We’ve changed our hiring process substantially, and through these efforts we’ve hired some fabulous people, doubling our engineering management team. Today, we want to share all these learnings with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-engineering-managers-like-we-hire-engineers&quot;&gt;Hiring engineering managers like we hire engineers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we shared “&lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/how-we-interview-engineers-at-circleci/&quot;&gt;How we interview engineers&lt;/a&gt;”. This was our process at the time, which we used for both engineers and engineering managers. Overall in 2018, we had hundreds of candidates pass through our engineering hiring process. Our process for hiring engineers worked as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/media/HiringProcessBefore1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hiring Process Before&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applicant Review &amp;gt; Hiring Manager Phone Screen &amp;gt; Kata &amp;gt; Macro Skills &amp;gt; Final Round (Collaborative Exercise, CTO Conversation, Product Interview) For more details about this process, see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/how-we-interview-engineers-at-circleci/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2018, we used the same hiring process for both engineers and engineering managers. At the time, our job postings for engineering managers were heavily focused on alignment between their technical background and the technical work of their team. As we wrote in our original post, “we include a coding problem because it’s so important to find out if the candidate’s values and priorities align with those of the team they will be managing.” We went through this hiring process with a few engineering manager applicants, and realized that we frequently got to the onsite stage, and only found out during pairing that their management skills weren’t matching our expectations – far too late to find this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shone a light onto a bigger issue: it made us realize that our attempt to align all our hiring processes had led us to focusing on, and optimizing for, the wrong skill set. There was a time when we thought having very technical managers would be a good thing. We were going for an adaptation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf&quot;&gt;Spotify model&lt;/a&gt;, where we’d have delivery teams and managers across different teams aligned by discipline. As our take on this organizational model evolved to align with our needs as a distributed engineering organization, we realized we wanted to distribute leadership more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduced additional roles to support our teams in different areas: team leads, responsible for their team’s delivery, and tech leads, responsible for facilitating technical work. With our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/why-we-re-designed-our-engineering-career-paths-at-circleci/&quot;&gt;Engineering Competency Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, we also codified our expectation of leadership from all engineers, across all levels. The early successes we witnessed from these changes encouraged us to continue evolving our understanding of what makes a good engineering manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-support-for-our-engineers&quot;&gt;Better support for our engineers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management is not engineering. Engineering management is a fundamentally different job that necessitates different skills, and we need to treat it as such. Engineering managers at CircleCI are now dedicated to people management: focused on development of a set of engineers, tech leads, and team leads. They hold regular 1:1s and career growth conversations with the engineers who report to them, and are responsible for goal setting, feedback, coaching, and mentoring for them. They also work across a set of teams to ensure team health, knowledge sharing, business value delivery and alignment across teams. This means that our engineers have managers who have great interest and investment in their personal and professional growth, and teams have someone to coach them through the product delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;adapting-our-process-to-our-re-focused-values&quot;&gt;Adapting our process to our re-focused values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of learning what really matters to us in engineering management, we adapted our open positions to roles focused on both people and business value delivery. We also changed our hiring process and the design of each interview stage to explore these areas earlier in the interview process. At the same time, we moved to a more structured, behavior-based interview process for all applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what our hiring process for engineering managers looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/media/HiringProcessAfter1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Engineering Manager Hiring Process After&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applicant Review &amp;gt; Hiring Manager Phone Screen &amp;gt; Pairing Exercise &amp;gt; Product Thinking &amp;amp; Work Breakdown Discussion &amp;gt; Final Round (Engineering Team Member Interview, Management Skills Deep Dive, Product Interview)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new process, which puts emphasis on people management and business value delivery, we assess for these skills as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Hiring manager phone screen:&lt;/strong&gt; The hiring manager for this role talks with the candidate about their management experience across different areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Collaborative exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a collaborative interview, in which the candidate is paired with one of our engineering managers. Together, they work through two challenges that we faced as an organization in the past, and which could still occur again today. Like with our technical pairing exercises, we want to make sure to reflect the actual work we’re doing – and talking through challenges and developing solutions together as an engineering management team is very important to our daily work together. This interview helps us understand a bit more the candidate’s approach to organizational challenges, and how they’d collaborate with a peer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Product thinking and work breakdown discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; In this interview, the candidate and another member of our engineering management team discuss some questions related to their ability to understand work and delivery, and guide discussions from a customer value perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Engineering team member interview:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a conversation with a senior engineer with whom the candidate would be working. Together, they discuss collaboration challenges that our teams have faced in the past. We look for candidates’ ability to mentor and add value to technical discussions while understanding their own limitations, supporting a technical decision without acting as a decision-maker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Management skills deep dive:&lt;/strong&gt; This conversation is usually with a senior member of the engineering management team, and a deeper discussion of important leadership skills and the candidate’s management experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Product interview:&lt;/strong&gt; This last interview is with a member of our product team, and focuses on the candidate’s perspective on product, process, and building healthy engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing our process this way has helped us screen for the right values and skills, and determine which candidates align with them early on. Ultimately, it has enabled us to hire great managers who care, whose values align with ours as an organization, and who can help us take our engineering organization through its next growth phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, we’re working on ensuring full alignment of this process with our newly-adopted Engineering Management Competency Matrix (this matrix is not public yet, but we’re aiming to share it soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our values and the role of an engineering manager sound like something you’d enjoy, please get in touch – we’re hiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.greenhouse.io/circleci/jobs/4195911002&quot;&gt;engineering managers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.greenhouse.io/circleci/jobs/4200209002&quot;&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;! And if working with a great team and a manager who’s invested in your growth is interesting to you, join us &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.greenhouse.io/circleci&quot;&gt;as an engineer&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have feedback about our process? I’d love to hear your comments. Email me: lena@circleci.com&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada&amp;#039;s Bell Tried to Have VPNs Banned During NAFTA Negotiations</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190130/10141941498/canadas-bell-tried-to-have-vpns-banned-during-nafta-negotiations.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190130/10141941498/canadas-bell-tried-to-have-vpns-banned-during-nafta-negotiations.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;missing-the-point&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries around the world continue to wage a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170609/09213837550/russia-stumbles-forth-quest-to-ban-vpns-private-messenger-apps.shtml&quot;&gt;not particularly subtle war&lt;/a&gt; on the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and encryption. In Russia, the government has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170609/09213837550/russia-stumbles-forth-quest-to-ban-vpns-private-messenger-apps.shtml&quot;&gt;all but banned&lt;/a&gt; the use of VPNs by layering all manner of obnoxious restrictions and caveats on VPN operators. The goal, as we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180117/02201339017/chinas-solution-to-vpn-quandary-only-authorized-presumably-backdoored-crypto-links-allowed.shtml&quot;&gt;seen in China&lt;/a&gt; and countless other countries, is to ban VPN use without making it explicitly clear you're banning VPN use. The deeper goal is always the same: less privacy and online freedom for users who use such tools to dodge surveillance or other, even dumber government policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there's plenty of companies eager to see VPN use banned as well, whether it's the entertainment industry hoping to thwart piracy, or broadcasters trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160119/06304133371/vpn-providers-laugh-off-netflixs-new-futile-war-vpns.shtml&quot;&gt;hinder&lt;/a&gt; those looking to dance around geographical viewing restrictions. Lost in the hysteria is usually the fact that VPNs are just another security tool with a myriad of purposes, most of which aren't remotely nefarious and shouldn't be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, you can count Canadian telecom incumbent Bell among the companies hoping to ban VPN use. Anja Karadeglija, the editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirereport.ca/2019/01/23/bell-asked-govt-to-ban-some-vpns-documents/&quot;&gt;paywalled telecom news outlet the Wire Report&lt;/a&gt;, obtained documents this week highlighting how Bell had been pushing Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3mvam/canadian-telecom-giant-bell-wanted-nafta-to-ban-some-vpns&quot;&gt;VPN ban to be included in NAFTA negotiations&lt;/a&gt;. Why? It doesn't want users using VPNs to watch the US Netflix catalog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;In its submission, Bell argued that Canadians accessing content from a US service with a VPN “unjustly enriches the US service, which has not paid for the Canadian rights” but nonetheless makes that content available to Canadians. Bell’s media arm reportedly spends millions on content for it streaming service, Crave TV, which allows Canadians to stream content from American networks such as HBO and Showtime.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again though, it's &lt;em&gt;not the VPN doing that&lt;/em&gt;. And if you want to stop users from flocking to better content catalogs elsewhere on the continent, you should focus your ire on the things causing that to happen -- like increasingly dated and absurd geo-viewing restrictions, and your own substandard content offerings that fail to adequately match up. That message was lost on Bell, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Canada should seek rules in NAFTA that require each party to explicitly make it unlawful to offer a VPN service used for the purpose of circumventing copyright, to allow rightsholders to enforce this rule, and to confirm that it is a violation of copyright if a service effectively makes content widely available in territories in which it does not own the copyright due to an ineffective or insufficiently robust geo-targeting system,” the submission stated.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly you're supposed to determine that somebody is using a VPN to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; watch Bell's own television services isn't really explained, and the fact that enforcement would likely be technically impossible appears to have been an afterthought. As Canadian Law Professor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2019/01/bell-urged-canadian-government-to-ban-some-vpn-services-in-nafta-submission/&quot;&gt;Michael Geist was quick to note&lt;/a&gt;, trying to ban VPNs just as they're reaching critical mass as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171009/10301738370/cyberstalking-case-highlights-how-vpn-provider-claims-about-not-keeping-logs-are-often-false.shtml&quot;&gt;partial&lt;/a&gt; solution to raging North American privacy scandals suggests Bell may not exactly have its finger on the pulse of common sense on this particular subject.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft’s Resurgence Under Satya Nadella</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;DAVOS, Switzerland—When Satya Nadella took Microsoft Corp.’s helm five years ago, the conventional wisdom was that the company’s glory days were behind it. Its ubiquitous Windows system was losing its primacy and a costly bet on acquiring Nokia’s mobile-phone business had failed to pay off. Microsoft’s stock had stagnated for a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Nadella—Microsoft’s third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer—soon dismantled the company’s mobile-phone operations and began making cloud computing the heart of Microsoft’s business....
