<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though their numbers are growing, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@codeorg/girls-set-ap-computer-science-record-skyrocketing-growth-outpaces-boys-41b7c01373a5&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;27 percent of all students&lt;/a&gt; taking the AP Computer Science exam in the United States are female. The gender gap only grows worse from there: Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/anybody-can-learn/university-computer-science-finally-surpasses-its-2003-peak-ecefa4c8d77d&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American computer-science college degrees go to women. This is in the United States, where many college men proudly describe themselves as “male feminists” and girls are taught they can be anything they want to be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Algeria, 41 percent of college graduates in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math—or “&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;,” as it’s known—are female. There, employment discrimination against women is rife and women are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/algeria-police-tell-woman-go-back-abusive-husband-human-rights-watch-a7696221.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;often pressured&lt;/a&gt; to make amends with their abusive husbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/there-are-only-3-countries-where-girls-feel-more-comfortable-with-math-than-boys/284272/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;I covered a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates were the only three countries in which boys are significantly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to feel comfortable working on math problems than girls are. In all of the other nations surveyed, girls were more likely to say they feel “helpless while performing a math problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what explains the tendency for nations that have traditionally &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; gender equality to have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; women in science and technology than their gender-progressive counterparts do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/02/Screen_Shot_2018_02_16_at_12.33.16_PM/d099fa13a.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;A scatterplot of countries based on their number of female STEM graduates and their Global Gender Gap Index (y-axis), a measure of opportunities for women (Psychological Science)
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617741719&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; by the psychologists Gijsbert Stoet, at Leeds Beckett University, and David Geary, at the University of Missouri, it could have to do with the fact that women in countries with higher gender inequality are simply seeking the clearest possible path to financial freedom. And often, that path leads through &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue doesn’t appear to be girls’ aptitude for &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; professions. In looking at test scores across 67 countries and regions, Stoet and Geary found that girls performed about as well or better than boys did on science in most countries, and in almost all countries, girls would have been capable of college-level science and math classes if they had enrolled in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to their &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; strengths, in almost all the countries—all except Romania and Lebanon—boys’ best subject was science, and girls’ was reading. (That is, even if an average girl was as good as an average boy at science, she was still likely to be even better at reading.) Across all countries, 24 percent of girls had science as their best subject, 25 percent of girls’ strength was math, and 51 percent excelled in reading. For boys, the percentages were 38 for science, 42 for math, and 20 for reading. And the more gender-equal the country, as measured by the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index, the larger this gap between boys and girls in having science as their best subject. (The most gender-equal countries are the typical snowy utopias you hear about, like Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. Turkey and the United Arab Emirates rank among the least equal, according to the Global Gender Gap Index.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap in reading “is related at least in part to girls’ advantages in basic language abilities and a generally greater interest in reading; they read more and thus practice more,” Geary told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the countries that minted the most female college graduates in fields like science, engineering, or math were also some of the least gender-equal countries. They posit that this is because the countries that empower women also empower them, indirectly, to pick whatever career they’d enjoy most and be best at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries with the highest gender equality tend to be welfare states,” they write, “with a high level of social security.” Meanwhile, less gender-equal countries tend to also have less social support for people who, for example, find themselves unemployed. Thus, the authors suggest, girls in those countries might be more inclined to choose &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; professions, since they offer a more certain financial future than, say, painting or writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the study authors looked at the “overall life satisfaction” rating of each country—a measure of economic opportunity and hardship—they found that gender-equal countries had more life satisfaction. The life-satisfaction ranking explained 35 percent of the variation between gender equality and women’s participation in &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;. That correlation echoes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19824299&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the genders are actually more segregated by field of study in more economically developed places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot of this research is neither especially feminist nor especially sad: It’s not that gender equality discourages girls from pursuing science. It’s that it allows them not to if they’re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will likely seem controversial, since the idea that men and women have different inherent abilities is often used as a reason, by some, to argue we should forget trying to recruit more women into the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; fields. But, as the University of Wisconsin gender-studies professor Janet Shibley Hyde, who wasn’t involved with the study, put it to me, that’s not quite what’s happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some would say that the gender &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; gap occurs not because girls can’t do science, but because they have other alternatives, based on their strengths in verbal skills,” she said. “In wealthy nations, they believe that they have the freedom to pursue those alternatives and not worry so much that they pay less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, this line of research, if it’s replicated, might hold useful takeaways for people who do want to see more Western women entering &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; fields. In this study, the percentage of girls who did excel in science or math was still larger than the number of women who were graduating with &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; degrees. That means there’s something in even the most liberal societies that’s nudging women away from math and science, even when those are their best subjects. The women-in-&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; advocates could, for starters, focus their efforts on those would-be &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, it could just be that, feeling financially secure and on equal footing with men, some women will always choose to follow their passions, rather than whatever labor economists recommend. And those passions don’t always lie within science.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A podcast that hacks Ring camera owners live</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A blaring siren &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/florida-cape-coral-amazon-ring-home-security-system-hacked-racial-slurs-1476430&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suddenly rips through the Ring camera&lt;/a&gt;, startling the Florida family inside their own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's your boy Chance on Nulled,&quot; a voice says from the Ring camera, which a hacker has taken over. &quot;How you doing? How you doing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Welcome to the NulledCast,&quot; the voice says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NulledCast is a podcast livestreamed to Discord. It's a show in which hackers take over people's Ring and Nest smarthome cameras and use their speakers to talk to and harass their unsuspecting owners. In the example above, Chance blared noises and shouted racist comments at the Florida family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sit back and relax to over 45 minutes of entertainment,&quot; an advertisement for the podcast posted to a hacking forum called Nulled reads. &quot;Join us as we go on completely random tangents such as; Ring &amp;amp; Nest Trolling, telling shelter owners we killed a kitten, Nulled drama, and more ridiculous topics. Be sure to join our Discord to watch the shows live.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software to hack Ring cameras has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a88k5/how-hackers-are-breaking-into-ring-cameras&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently become popular on the forum&lt;/a&gt;. The software churns through previously compromised email addresses and passwords to break into Ring cameras at scale. This has led to a recent spate of hacks that have occurred both during the podcast and at other times, several of which have been covered by local media outlets. In Brookhaven a hacker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/dekalb-county/-wake-up-woman-says-someone-hacked-surveillance-system-yelled-at-her-dog/1017442073/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shouted at a sleeping woman&lt;/a&gt; through her hacked Ring camera to wake-up. In Texas, a hacker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/hacker-says-pay-bitcoin-ransom-or-get-terminated-through-couples-ring-security-cameras/287-226c535c-c765-4b29-91b6-d849fb315e94&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demanded a couple pay a bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; ransom. Hackers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/12/11/family-says-hackers-accessed-ring-camera-their-year-old-daughters-room/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;targeted a family in DeSoto County, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, and spoke through the device to one of the young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;discord-announcement&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1576166978612-discord-announcement.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A screenshot of an announcement in the NulledCast Discord server. Image: Motherboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring cameras are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjp53/how-ring-went-from-shark-tank-reject-to-americas-scariest-surveillance-company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wildly popular home surveillance devices&lt;/a&gt; owned and heavily marketed by Amazon. The company has signed partnership agreements with hundreds of police departments around the country; many of these police departments have marketed and sold Ring devices on the company's behalf. These internet-connected cameras &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/ring-s-hidden-data-let-us-map-amazons-sprawling-home-su-1840312279&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have invaded much of America's suburbs&lt;/a&gt;, as Gizmodo showed using data that Ring left exposed. These hacks, and this podcast, have turned devices nominally designed to protect people's homes into surveillance devices that have been turned back on their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the recent media attention about Ring hacks, Nulled members are scrambling to remove evidence of the Ring hacks and distance themselves from the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey NulledCast fans, we need to calm down on the ring trolling, we have 3 investigations and two of us are already probably fucked,&quot; one of the self-described podcast staff wrote on a NulledCast Discord server that Motherboard gained access to. &quot;Drop suggestions on what else we should do. It will still happen just on a much smaller scale,&quot; they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Nulled forum, which has thousands of members, administrators tried to delete all evidence of Ring hacking by rolling back the entire forum's database by four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you know anything else about breaking into Ring cameras? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a88k5/how-hackers-are-breaking-into-ring-cameras&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;While Motherboard was originally reporting&lt;/a&gt; on the existence of dedicated tools for breaking into Ring cameras, the Nulled website went offline for &quot;unscheduled maintenance,&quot; a placeholder on the site read Wednesday. When the site returned, threads about Ring had been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nulled admin then added a message to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following the recent news regarding Ring and various members, we feel it is necessary to address and &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; concerns or malformed notions. Nulled does not and will not tolerate the harassments &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; of individuals over Ring cameras or similar,&quot; the message read. It then added that discussing Ring accounts and similar topics was banned from the site, as well as selling any Ring or Nest accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;No discussing in Shoutbox regarding this,&quot; the message read, referring to an instant chat service on Nulled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Discord members are split into various groups, such as podcast staff, podcast members, and podcast advocates. In all, around 200 people are members of the Discord server where hackers livestream the hacking of Ring cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a now deleted thread, a Nulled user wrote, &quot;Hello everyone. As you probably have heard, I was featured on the news for a stunt I pulled.&quot; Motherboard was only able to view a partial archive of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, some members of the Discord appeared to be panicking, changing their usernames and some saying they are quitting because mainstream media outlets are now covering the Ring hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;channel-nuke&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1576167325732-channel-nuke.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A screenshot of a bot deleting posts in the NulledCast Discord server. Image: Motherboard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Ring spokesperson previously said in a statement, &quot;Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously. While we are still investigating this issue and are taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation, we are able to confirm this incident is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring’s security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024818291-Using-Two-Factor-Security-Authentication-with-Your-Ring-Products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enable two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; on their Ring account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/211018223-Controlling-Ring-Devices-through-Multiple-Devices-or-Sharing-Control-with-Other-Users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;add Shared Users&lt;/a&gt; (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018709231-How-Do-I-Change-my-Password-in-the-Ring-App-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;change their passwords&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's fucked dude. It's everywhere,&quot; one user wrote on the Discord server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm quitting. It's on mainstream news now,&quot; another responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lmfao doesn't matter nothing's gonna happen,&quot; another said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only chance and faez will get arrested don't worry,&quot; a fourth responded, referring to the hacker named during the Florida Ring hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem the livestreaming of Ring hacking is going to end just yet, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Podcast dead?&quot; one user on the Nulled Discord asked Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another user replied, &quot;Nope. Tune in Friday. Like and subscribe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1091947418/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Google helps police track users, innocent people's data disclosed&quot; data-height=&quot;3733&quot; data-width=&quot;5600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Google keeps historical locations of users, and police are taking advantage to find all kinds of &lt;span class=&quot;plus&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;caption expand&quot;&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;expanded-caption&quot;&gt;criminals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;Two dead dogs and more than $50,000 in damaged property were just some of the casualties of arsons carried out across Milwaukee, Wisconsin, throughout 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the perpetrators, officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) demanded Google supply records of user devices in the respective locations at the times the arsons took place, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; has learned. Though federal agents had used the technique before, they’d never received such a data haul back from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requests, outlined in two search warrants obtained by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, demanded to know which specific Google customers were located in areas covering 29,387 square meters (or 3 hectares) during a total of nine hours for the four separate incidents. Unbeknownst to many Google users, if they have “location history” turned on, their whereabouts are stored by the tech giant in a database called SensorVault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Google found 1,494 device identifiers in SensorVault, sending them to the ATF to comb through. In terms of numbers, that’s unprecedented for this form of search. It illustrates how Google can pinpoint a large number of mobile phones in a brief period of time and hand over that information to the government. Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/10/23/feds-are-ordering-google-to-hand-over-a-load-of-innocent-peoples-locations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/08/15/to-catch-a-robber-the-fbi-attempted-an-unprecendeted-grab-for-google-location-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; has shown searches across far wider areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigators, this kind of “geofence” demand is useful, allowing them to go through the data trove provided by Google, look for devices of interest such as a known suspect’s phone and ask for more personal information on the user of that mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's also the kind of search that's been making pro-privacy folk anxious over the last year. Such data grabs, also referred to as “reverse location searches,” see the police give Google a timeframe and an area on Google Maps within which to find every Google user within. Google then looks through its SensorVault database of user locations, taken from devices running the tech giant’s services like Google Maps or anything that requires the “location history” feature be turned on. The police then look through the list, decide which devices are of interest to the investigation and ask for subscriber information that includes more detailed data such as name, email address, when they signed up to Google services and which ones they used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5df0e14a25ab5d0007ce246f/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Google geofence and reverse location search results.&quot; data-height=&quot;314&quot; data-width=&quot;1194&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Google supplies the government with &quot;anonymized&quot; user data on users within and around a bank at the &lt;span class=&quot;plus&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;caption expand&quot;&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;expanded-caption&quot;&gt;time of a robbery. In this case, investigators asked for identifying information on all six users and Google provided it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Thomas Brewster&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether or not Google handed over any identifying information, but to Jerome Greco, a public defender in the Digital Forensics Unit of the Legal Aid Society, it’s a sign that geofence warrants are overly broad and endanger user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The number of phones identified in that area shows two key points,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. “One, it demonstrates a sample of how many people’s minute-by-minute movements Google is precisely tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two, it shows the unconstitutional nature of reverse location search warrants because they inherently invade the privacy of numerous people, who everyone agrees are unconnected to the crime being investigated, for the mere possibility that it may help identify a suspect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATF, which filed the search warrants in Wisconsin, said it couldn’t comment on ongoing investigations. Neither of the two suspects named in the warrants have been charged in federal court at the time of publication. As for its use of Google geofence searches, a spokesperson said: “To ensure the safety of our special agents and other law enforcement partners with whom we work, ATF does not release information regarding certain law enforcement techniques to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Salgado, Google director of law enforcement and information security, said the company had processes to look through government requests and ensure customer privacy was protected. “We only produce information that identifies specific users when we are legally required to do so,” said Salgado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bank heist investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; obtained another search warrant that indicates Google &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; trying to fight back against overly broad government requests, but still appears to be handing over innocent people’s information as well as legitimate suspect data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another a previously unknown geofence search, federal officers wanted Google to share information on devices in the vicinity of a bank robbery in Allenton, Wisconsin, in April this year. Initially, Google deemed the area the government wanted it to search too wide. By pushing back, Google convinced investigators to reduce the search area from a 400 meter radius, to 50 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google then returned phone identifiers for six devices. The government asked for personal details of the individual users for all six, which the tech giant duly provided, including name, email and other Google account use data. Only two suspects, who are currently awaiting trial for that robbery and two others in the state, have been named, indicating innocents’ personal data was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guilty until proven innocent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That geofence warrants scoop up innocents’ data has now been proven beyond doubt. In one previous case detailed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an innocent man was falsely imprisoned for a week, in part because of the data provided by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Orin Kerr, a professor at Berkeley Law, says that use of innocents’ information is going to be inherent in investigations. Video footage of bank robberies, for instance, will contain images of innocents there at the time, Kerr adds. “Presumably, most people who are on that video are innocent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re  concerned about being caught up in any dragnet, it’s possible to opt out of Google’s historic location database. To do this, users can go to their My Activity page in their Google account and click on Activity Controls. From there, you can toggle the location history feature off.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A painting discovered on the wall of an Indonesian cave has been found to be 44,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art appears to show a buffalo being hunted by part-human, part-animal creatures holding spears and possibly ropes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers think the scene could be the world's oldest-recorded story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were presented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03826-4&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt; by archaeologists from Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Brumm - an archaeologist at Griffith - first saw the pictures two years ago, after a colleague in Indonesia shimmied up a fig tree to reach the cave passage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These images appeared on my iPhone,&quot; said Mr Brumm. &quot;I think I said the characteristic Australian four-letter word out very loud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian drawing is not the oldest in the world. Last year, scientists said they found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45501205&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;&quot;humanity's oldest drawing&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on a fragment of rock in South Africa, dated at 73,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What do the drawings show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawings were found in a cave called Leang Bulu'Sipong 4 in the south of Sulawesi, an Indonesian island east of Borneo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel is almost five metres wide and appears to show a type of buffalo called an anoa, plus wild pigs found on Sulawesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside them are smaller figures that look human - but also have animal features such as tails and snouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one section, an anoa is flanked by several figures holding spears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46114423&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;'Oldest animal painting' discovered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've never seen anything like this before,&quot; said Mr Brumm. &quot;I mean, we've seen hundreds of rock art sites in this region - but we've never seen anything like a hunting scene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other researchers have questioned whether the panel represents a single story - and say it could be a series of images painted over a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whether it's a scene is questionable,&quot; says Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist and rock-art specialist at Durham University told Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How do we know it's 44,000 years old?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analysed calcite &quot;popcorn&quot; that had built up on the painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radioactive uranium in the mineral slowly decays into thorium, so the team measured the levels of different isotopes of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the calcite on a pig began forming at least 43,900 years ago, and the deposits on two buffalo were at least 40,900 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least 242 caves or shelters with ancient imagery in Sulawesi alone - and new sites are being discovered annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How does it compare to other prehistoric art?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be the oldest drawing, but researchers say it could be the oldest story ever found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Previously, rock art found in European sites dated to around 14,000 to 21,000 years old were considered to be the world's oldest clearly narrative artworks,&quot; said the paper in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sulawesi drawings could also be the oldest animal drawing ever found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a cave painting in Borneo - thought to be the oldest of an animal - was found to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46114423&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;at least 40,000 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>Huginn: Create agents that monitor and act on your behalf</title>
<link>https://github.com/huginn/huginn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/huginn/huginn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7da893be2c2f5f765f2436296656e7d25962437/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f687567696e6e2f687567696e6e2f6d61737465722f6d656469612f687567696e6e2d6c6f676f2e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7da893be2c2f5f765f2436296656e7d25962437/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f687567696e6e2f687567696e6e2f6d61737465722f6d656469612f687567696e6e2d6c6f676f2e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;Huginn&quot; title=&quot;Your agents are standing by.&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://raw.github.com/huginn/huginn/master/media/huginn-logo.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Huginn?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online. They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf. Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server. You always know who has your data. You do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png&quot; alt=&quot;the origin of the name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (&quot;Don't forget your umbrella!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes. (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning? Huginn will watch the term &quot;machine learning&quot; on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch for air travel or shopping deals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrape websites and receive email when they change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to Adioso, HipChat, Basecamp, Growl, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, Wunderground, and Weibo, to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term &quot;san francisco emergency&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send and receive WebHooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track your location over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the &quot;HumanTaskAgent&quot;). For example: &quot;Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png&quot; alt=&quot;Making a new agent&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/docker/install.md&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git&lt;/code&gt; to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;.env.example&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;cp .env.example .env&lt;/code&gt;) and edit &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;, at least updating the &lt;code&gt;APP_SECRET_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with &lt;code&gt;DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; to install dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake db:create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt;, and then &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake db:seed&lt;/code&gt; to create a development database with some example Agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bundle exec foreman start&lt;/code&gt;, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/a&gt;, and login with the username of &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and the password of &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup some Agents!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically run &lt;code&gt;git fetch upstream&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge upstream/master&lt;/code&gt; to merge in the newest version of Huginn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: By default, email messages are intercepted in the &lt;code&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; Rails environment, which is what you just setup. You can view them at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000/letter_opener&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/letter_opener&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing with Huginn locally, set &lt;code&gt;SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need more detailed instructions, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide&quot;&gt;Novice setup guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Develop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run all specs with &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rspec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a specific spec with &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more about rspec for rails &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using Huginn Agent gems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the &lt;code&gt;ADDITIONAL_GEMS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. See the &lt;code&gt;Additional Agent gems&lt;/code&gt; section of &lt;code&gt;.env.example&lt;/code&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent&quot;&gt;huginn_agent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn&quot;&gt;the Huginn Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try Huginn on Heroku: &lt;a href=&quot;https://heroku.com/deploy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c0824806f5221ebb7d25e559568582dd39dd1170/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6865726f6b7563646e2e636f6d2f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;Deploy&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huginn launches on the free version of Heroku &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md&quot;&gt;with significant limitations&lt;/a&gt;. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OpenShift Online (v3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try Huginn on OpenShift Online (v3): &lt;code&gt;oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json&lt;/code&gt;. You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to &quot;Add to Project&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Import YAML/JSON&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to remove any existing application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manual installation on any server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md&quot;&gt;installation guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optional Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setup for private development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions&quot;&gt;private development instructions&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Enable the WeatherAgent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use the WeatherAgent you need an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API key with Wunderground&lt;/a&gt;. Signup for one and then change the value of &lt;code&gt;api_key: your-key&lt;/code&gt; in your seeded WeatherAgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, Wunderground no longer offers free API keys. You can still use the WeatherAgent by setting the service key to darksky, and getting an &lt;a href=&quot;https://darksky.net/dev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API key from DarkSky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disable SSL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit &lt;code&gt;config/initializers/devise.rb&lt;/code&gt; and modify the line containing &lt;code&gt;config.rememberable_options = { :secure =&amp;gt; true }&lt;/code&gt;. You will also need to edit &lt;code&gt;config/environments/production.rb&lt;/code&gt; and modify the value of &lt;code&gt;config.force_ssl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We Just Got a Rare Look at US National Security Surveillance</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-fbi.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-fbi.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — When a long-awaited inspector general report about the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation became public this week, partisans across the political spectrum mined it to argue about whether President Trump falsely smeared the F.B.I. or was its victim. But the report was also important for reasons that had nothing to do with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever at the government’s secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil. And what the report showed was not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Justice Department’s independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, and his team uncovered a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process in how the F.B.I. went about obtaining and renewing court permission under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The litany of problems with the Carter Page surveillance applications demonstrates how the secrecy shrouding the government’s one-sided FISA approval process breeds abuse,” said Hina Shamsi, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “The concerns the inspector general identifies apply to intrusive investigations of others, including especially Muslims, and far better safeguards against abuse are necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate domestic surveillance for national-security investigations — monitoring suspected spies and terrorists, as opposed to ordinary criminals. Investigators must persuade a judge on a special court that a target is probably an agent of a foreign power. In 2018, there were &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dni.gov/files/CLPT/documents/2019_ASTR_for_CY2018.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1,833 targets of such orders, including 232 Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of those targets never learn that their privacy has been invaded, but some are sent to prison on the basis of evidence derived from the surveillance. And unlike in ordinary criminal wiretap cases, defendants are not permitted to see what investigators told the court about them to obtain permission to eavesdrop on their calls and emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fbi-ig-hearing.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Mr. Horowitz’s report on Wednesday, both Republicans and Democrats suggested that legislation tightening restrictions on FISA surveillance may be coming, and the A.C.L.U. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/2019-12-11_aclu_senate_judiciary_examining_the_inspector_general_report_on_alleged_abuses_hearing.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submitted ideas to the committee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Civil libertarians for years have called the surveillance court a rubber stamp because it only rarely rejects wiretap applications. Out of 1,080 requests by the government in 2018, for example, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/nsd/nsd-foia-library/2018fisa/download&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government records&lt;/a&gt; showed that the court fully denied only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Defenders of the system have argued that the low rejection rate stems in part from how well the Justice Department self-polices and avoids presenting the court with requests that fall short of the legal standard. They have also stressed that officials obey a heightened duty to be candid and provide any mitigating evidence that might undercut their request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the inspector general found major errors, material omissions and unsupported statements about Mr. Page in the materials that went to the court. F.B.I. agents cherry-picked the evidence, telling the Justice Department information that made Mr. Page look suspicious and omitting material that cut the other way, and the department passed that misleading portrait onto the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To give just three examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;First, when agents initially sought permission for the wiretap, F.B.I. officials scoured information from confidential informants and selectively presented portions that supported their suspicions that Mr. Page might be a conduit between Russia and the Trump campaign’s onetime chairman, Paul Manafort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But officials did not disclose information that undercut that allegation — such as the fact that Mr. Page had told an informant in August 2016 that he “never met” or “said one word” to Mr. Manafort, who had never returned Mr. Page’s emails. Even if the investigators did not necessarily believe Mr. Page, the court should have been told what he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Second, as the initial court order was nearing its expiration and law-enforcement officials prepared to ask the surveillance court to renew it, the F.B.I. had uncovered information that cast doubt on some of its original assertions. But law enforcement officials never reported that new information to the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Specifically, the application included allegations about Mr. Page contained in a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent whose research was funded by Democrats. In January 2017, the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Steele’s own primary source, and he contradicted what Mr. Steele had written in the dossier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The source for Mr. Steele may, of course, have been lying. But either way, officials should have flagged the disconnect for the court. Instead, the F.B.I. reported that its agents had met with the source to “further corroborate” the dossier and found him to be “truthful and cooperative,” leaving a misleading impression in renewal applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, the report stressed Mr. Page’s long history of meeting with Russian intelligence officials. But he had also said that he had a relationship with the C.I.A., and it turns out that he had for years told the agency about those meetings — including one that was cited in the wiretap application as a reason to be suspicious of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That relationship could have mitigated some suspicions about his history. But the F.B.I. never got to the bottom of it, and the court filings said nothing about Mr. Page’s dealings with the C.I.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The inspector general’s report contains many more examples of errors and omissions. Mr. Horowitz largely blamed lower-level F.B.I. agents charged with preparing the evidence, but he also faulted high-level supervisors for permitting a culture in which the inaccuracies took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And while Mr. Horowitz obtained no documents or testimony showing that the inaccuracies stemmed from any political bias — as opposed to incompetence and negligence — he also rejected as “unsatisfactory” the explanation that the agents were busy on the larger Russian investigation and that the Page wiretap order was only a small part of their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Still, it is undeniable that the agents and supervisors compiling materials for the Page wiretap application were under far more pressure than in routine counterintelligence investigations. Both in terms of the stakes and the tempo, the early Russia investigation may have had more in common with a counterterrorism investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But that factor also raises the question of what goes into applications for wiretaps in lower-profile cases. Indeed, everyone involved in the Page wiretap knew that what they were working on was likely to come under close scrutiny, yet they still repeatedly failed to follow policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Horowitz also said senior-level supervisors bore responsibility for permitting systemic failures to fester, and his office has begun a broader audit of unrelated FISA applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His exposé left some former officials who generally defend government surveillance practices aghast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These errors are bad,” said David Kris, an expert in FISA who oversaw the Justice Department’s National Security Division in the Obama administration. “If the broader audit of FISA applications reveals a systematic pattern of errors of this sort that plagued this one, then I would expect very serious consequences and reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On rare occasions, the public has caught glimpses of problems with the information that goes into FISA applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2000, the Justice Department confessed to errors in F.B.I. affidavits submitted in 75 surveillance and search applications related to major terrorist attacks, a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc051702.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FISA court opinion&lt;/a&gt; disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The court met “to consider the troubling number of inaccurate F.B.I. affidavits” and barred an unnamed F.B.I. agent from making affidavits before the court. In response, the F.B.I. came up with far more rigorous internal procedures, pledging to ensure the accuracy of FISA affidavits by more carefully reviewing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But when Mr. Horowitz’s investigators looked at the underlying files for the Page applications, they found errors and omissions that showed that the F.B.I. had not scrupulously followed those procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The government has fought hard to keep outsiders from seeing what goes into its FISA applications. In 2014, a federal judge in Illinois &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1010272-daoud-fisa-suppression-and-disclosure-order-1-29.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; the government to show a defense lawyer classified materials about the national security surveillance of his client, which would have been the first time a defense lawyer had been given such materials since Congress enacted FISA in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the Obama administration appealed, and an appeals court &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/14-1284/14-1284-2014-07-29.pdf?ts=1411046512&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overturned&lt;/a&gt; the order, agreeing that letting the defense counsel see the application would create an intolerable risk of disclosing sensitive government secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That stands in contrast to how wiretapping works in ordinary criminal law. Targets are usually told when the surveillance ends. If they are prosecuted based on evidence gathered from the wiretap, they get to see what was in the application so their defense lawyers can argue that the government made a mistake and the evidence should be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The prospect of that adversarial second-guessing gives criminal investigators a reason to be scrupulous about what they put into their requests for wiretaps. In the absence of that disciplining factor, the government has developed heightened internal oversight about what goes into FISA applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But that system demonstrably failed in the Page wiretap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The report should call into question the legitimacy of the FISA system “whether you like Trump, hate Trump, don’t care about Trump,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said at the hearing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’d hate to lose the ability of the FISA court to operate at a time probably when we need it the most,” Mr. Graham told Mr. Horowitz. “But after your report, I have serious concerns about whether the FISA court can continue unless there’s fundamental reform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>We Only Hire the Trendiest (2016)</title>
<link>http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;We only hire the trendiest&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;354.49236641221&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We only hire the trendiest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance of mine, let’s call him Mike, is looking for work after getting laid off from a contract role at Microsoft, which has happened to a lot of people I know. Like me, Mike has 11 years in industry. Unlike me, he doesn't know a lot of folks at trendy companies, so I passed his resume around to some engineers I know at companies that are desperately hiring. My engineering friends thought Mike's resume was fine, but most recruiters rejected him in the resume screening phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked why he was getting rejected, the typical response I got was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tech experience is in irrelevant tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Experience is too random, with payments, mobile, data analytics, and UX.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractors are generally not the strongest technically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response is something from a recruiter that was relayed to me through an engineer; the engineer was incredulous at the response from the recruiter. Just so we have a name, let's call this company TrendCo. It's one of the thousands of companies that claims to have world class engineers, hire only the best, etc. This is one company in particular, but it's representative of a large class of companies and the responses Mike has gotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, (1) is code for “Mike's a .NET dev, and we don't like people with Windows experience”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm familiar with TrendCo's tech stack, which multiple employees have told me is “a tire fire”. Their core systems top out under 1k QPS, which has caused them to go down under load. Mike has worked on systems that can handle multiple orders of magnitude more load, but his experience is, apparently, irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) is hard to make sense of. I've interviewed at TrendCo and one of the selling points is that it's a startup where you get to do a lot of different things. TrendCo almost exclusively hires generalists but Mike is, apparently, too general for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3), combined with (1), gets at what TrendCo's real complaint with Mike is. He's not their type. TrendCo's median employee is a recent graduate from one of maybe five “top” schools with 0-2 years of experience. They have a few experienced hires, but not many, and most of their experienced hires have something trendy on their resume, not a boring old company like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you think there's anything wrong with having a type and rejecting people who aren't your type, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11290662&quot;&gt;Thomas Ptacek has observed&lt;/a&gt;, if your type is the same type everyone else is competing for, “you are competing for talent with the wealthiest (or most overfunded) tech companies in the market”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1UnLz40Our1Ids-O0sz26uPNCF6cQjwosrZQY4VLdflU/htmlview?pli=1&amp;amp;sle=true#&quot;&gt;you look at new grad hiring data&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like FB is offering people with zero experience &amp;gt; $100k/ salary, $100k signing bonus, and $150k in RSUs, for an amortized total comp &amp;gt; $160k/yr, including $240k in the first year. Google's package has &amp;gt; $100k salary, a variable signing bonus in the $10k range, and $187k in RSUs. That comes in a bit lower than FB, but it's much higher than most companies that claim to only hire the best are willing to pay for a new grad. Keep in mind that &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/#fn:C&quot;&gt;compensation can go much higher for contested candidates&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11314449&quot;&gt;compensation for experienced candidates is probably higher than you expect if you're not a hiring manager who's seen what competitive offers look like today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going after people with the most sought after qualifications, TrendCo has narrowed their options down to either paying out the nose for employees, or offering non-competitive compensation packages. TrendCo has chosen the latter option, which partially explains why they have, proportionally, so few senior devs -- the compensation delta increases as you get more senior, and you have to make a really compelling pitch to someone to get them to choose TrendCo when you're offering $150k/yr less than the competition. And as people get more experience, they're less likely to believe the part of the pitch that explains how much the stock options are worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I don't have anything against people with trendy backgrounds. I know a lot of these people who have impeccable interviewing skills and got 5-10 strong offers last time they looked for work. I've worked with someone like that: he was just out of school, his total comp package was north of $200k/yr, and he was worth every penny. But think about that for a minute. He had strong offers from six different companies, of which he was going to accept at most one. Including lunch and phone screens, the companies put in an average of eight hours apiece interviewing him. And because they wanted to hire him so much, the companies that were really serious spent an average of another five hours apiece of engineer time trying to convince him to take their offer. Because these companies had, on average, a ⅙ chance of hiring this person, they have to spend at least an expected (8+5) * 6 = 78 hours of engineer time. People with great backgrounds are, on average, pretty great, but they're really hard to hire. It's much easier to hire people who are underrated, especially if you're not paying market rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this hyperfocus on hiring people with trendy backgrounds from both sides of the table, and it's ridiculous from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the referring side of hiring, I tried to get a startup I was at to hire the most interesting and creative programmer I've ever met, who was tragically underemployed for years because of his low GPA in college. We declined to hire him and I was told that his low GPA meant that he couldn't be very smart. Years later, Google took a chance on him and he's been killing it since then. He actually convinced me to join Google, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/&quot;&gt;at Google, I tried to hire one of the most productive programmers I know, who was promptly rejected by a recruiter for not being technical enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the candidate side of hiring, I've experienced both being in demand and being almost unhireable. Because I did my undergrad at Wisconsin, which is one of the 25 schools that claims to be a top 10 cs/engineering school, I had recruiters beating down my door when I graduated. But that's silly -- that I attended Wisconsin wasn't anything about me; I just happened to grow up in the state of Wisconsin. If I grew up in Utah, I probably would have ended up going to school at Utah. When I've compared notes with folks who attended schools like Utah and Boise State, their education is basically the same as mine. Wisconsin's rank as an engineering school comes from having professors who do great research which is, at best, weakly correlated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://danluu.com/teach-debugging/&quot;&gt;effectiveness at actually teaching undergrads&lt;/a&gt;. Despite getting the same engineering education you could get at hundreds of other schools, I had a very easy time getting interviews and finding a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 7.5 years in that great job, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FSZU6FK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01FSZU6FK&amp;amp;linkId=d15e514c6ecefa224be8f05d4d5837e3&quot;&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;. Centaur has a pretty strong reputation among hardware companies in Austin who've been around for a while, and I had an easy time shopping for local jobs at hardware companies. But I don't know of any software folks who've heard of Centaur, and as a result I couldn't get an interview at most software companies. There were even a couple of cases where I had really strong internal referrals and the recruiters still didn't want to talk to me, which I found funny and my friends found frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I could get interviews, they often went poorly. A typical rejection reason was something like “we process millions of transactions per day here and we really need someone with more relevant experience who can handle these things without ramping up”. And then Google took a chance on me and I was the second person on a project to get serious about deep learning performance, which was a 20%-time project until just before I joined. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US20160342889&quot;&gt;We built the fastest deep learning system in the world&lt;/a&gt;. From what I hear, they're now on the Nth generation of that project, but even the first generation thing we built had better per-rack performance and performance per dollar than any other production system out there for years (excluding follow-ons to that project, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was at Google I had recruiters pinging me about job opportunities all the time. And now that I'm at boring old Microsoft, I don't get nearly as many recruiters reaching out to me. I've been considering looking for work and I wonder how trendy I'll be if I do. Experience in irrelevant tech? Check! Random experience? Check! Contractor? Well, no. But two out of three ain't bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here isn't anything about me. It's that here's this person who has wildly different levels of attractiveness to employers at various times, mostly due to superficial factors that don't have much to do with actual productivity. This is a really common story among people who end up at Google. If you hired them before they worked at Google, you might have gotten a great deal! But no one (except Google) was willing to take that chance. There's something to be said for paying more to get a known quantity, but a company like TrendCo that isn't willing to do that cripples its hiring pipeline by only going after people with trendy resumes, and if you wouldn't hire someone before they worked at Google and would after, the main thing you know is that the person is above average at whiteboard algorithms quizzes (or got lucky one day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to pick on startups like TrendCo in particular. Boring old companies have their version of what a trendy background is, too. A friend of mine who's desperate to hire can't do anything with some of the resumes I pass his way because his group isn't allowed to hire anyone without a degree. Another person I know is in a similar situation because his group has a bright-line rule that causes them to reject people who aren't already employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are these decisions non-optimal for companies, they create a path dependence in employment outcomes that causes individual good (or bad) events to follow people around for decades. You can see similar effects in the literature on career earnings in a variety of fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7260087&quot;&gt;Thomas Ptacek has this great line about how&lt;/a&gt; “we interview people whose only prior work experience is &quot;Line of Business .NET Developer&quot;, and they end up showing us how to write exploits for elliptic curve partial nonce bias attacks that involve Fourier transforms and BKZ lattice reduction steps that take 6 hours to run.” If you work at a company that doesn't reject people out of hand for not being trendy, you'll hear lots of stories like this. Some of the best people I've worked with went to schools you've never heard of and worked at companies you've never heard of until they ended up at Google. Some are still at companies you've never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://zachholman.com/talk/firing-people&quot;&gt;Zach Holman&lt;/a&gt;, you may recall that when he said that he was fired, someone responded with “If an employer has decided to fire you, then you've not only failed at your job, you've failed as a human being.” A lot of people treat employment status and credentials as measures of the inherent worth of individuals. But a large component of these markers of success, not to mention success itself, is luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;solutions&quot;&gt;Solutions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand why this happens. At an individual level, we're prone to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error&quot;&gt;fundamental attribution error&lt;/a&gt;. At an organizational level, fast growing organizations burn a large fraction of their time on interviews, and the obvious way to cut down on time spent interviewing is to only interview people with &quot;good&quot; qualifications. Unfortunately, that's counterproductive when you're chasing after the same tiny pool of people as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the beginnings of some ideas. I'm open to better suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Beane and Paul Depodesta took the Oakland A's, a baseball franchise with nowhere near the budget of top teams, and created what was arguably the best team in baseball by finding and “hiring” players who were statistically underrated for their price. The thing I find really amazing about this is that they publicly talked about doing this, and then Michael Lewis wrote a book, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393324818/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393324818&amp;amp;linkId=65d86d3a72b4c1ba73e8d3d52796eae1&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt;, about them doing this. Despite the publicity, it took years for enough competitors to catch on enough that the A's strategy stopped giving them a very large edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the exact same thing in software hiring. Thomas Ptacek has been talking about how they hired unusually effective people at Matasano for at least half a decade, maybe more. Google bigwigs regularly talk about the hiring data they have and what hasn't worked. I believe they talked about how focusing on top schools wasn't effective and didn't turn up employees that have better performance years ago, but that doesn't stop TrendCo from focusing hiring efforts on top schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;training-mentorship&quot;&gt;Training / mentorship&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see a lot of talk about moneyball, but for some reason people are less excited about… trainingball? Practiceball? Whatever you want to call taking people who aren't “the best” and teaching them how to be “the best”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another one where it's easy to see the impact through the lens of sports, because there is so much good performance data. Since it's basketball season, if we look at college basketball, for example, we can identify a handful of programs that regularly take unremarkable inputs and produce good outputs. And that's against a field of competitors where every team is expected to coach and train their players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tech companies, most of the competition isn't even trying. At the median large company, you get a couple days of “orientation”, which is mostly legal mumbo jumbo and paperwork, and the occasional “training”, which is usually a set of videos and a set of multiple-choice questions that are offered up for compliance reasons, not to teach anyone anything. And you'll be assigned a mentor who, more likely than not, won't provide any actual mentorship. Startups tend to be even worse! It's not hard to do better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering how much money companies spend on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11314449&quot;&gt;hiring and retaining&lt;/a&gt; &quot;the best&quot;, you'd expect them to spend at least a (non-zero) fraction on training. It's also quite strange that companies don't focus more or training and mentorship when trying to recruit. Specific things I've learned in specific roles have been tremendously valuable to me, but it's almost always either been a happy accident, or something I went out of my way to do. Most companies don't focus on this stuff. Sure, recruiters will tell you that &quot;you'll learn so much more here than at Google, which will make you more valuable&quot;, implying that it's worth the $150k/yr pay cut, but if you ask them what, specifically, they do to make a better learning environment than Google, they never have a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;process-tools-culture&quot;&gt;Process / tools / culture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked at two companies that both have effectively infinite resources to spend on tooling. One of them, let's call them ToolCo, is really serious about tooling and invests heavily in tools. People describe tooling there with phrases like “magical”, “the best I've ever seen”, and “I can't believe this is even possible”. And I can see why. For example, if you want to build a project that's millions of lines of code, their build system will make that take somewhere between 5s and 20s (assuming you don't enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization&quot;&gt;LTO&lt;/a&gt; or anything else that can't be parallelized). In the course of a regular day at work you'll use multiple tools that seem magical because they're so far ahead of what's available in the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other company, let's call them ProdCo &lt;a href=&quot;http://yosefk.com/blog/people-can-read-their-managers-mind.html&quot;&gt;pays lip service to tooling, but doesn't really value it&lt;/a&gt;. People describing ProdCo tools use phrases like “world class bad software” and “I am 2x less productive than I've ever been anywhere else”, and “I can't believe this is even possible”. ProdCo has a paper on a new build system; their claimed numbers for speedup from parallelization/caching, onboarding time, and reliability, are at least two orders of magnitude worse than the equivalent at ToolCo. And, in my experience, the actual numbers are worse than the claims in the paper. In the course of a day of work at ProdCo, you'll use multiple tools that are multiple orders of magnitude worse than the equivalent at ToolCo in multiple dimensions. These kinds of things add up and can easily make a larger difference than “hiring only the best”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes and culture also matter. I once worked on a team that didn't use version control or have a bug tracker. For every no-brainer item on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html&quot;&gt;Joel test&lt;/a&gt;, there are teams out there that make the wrong choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I've only worked on one team that completely failed the Joel test (they scored a 1 out of 12), every team I've worked on has had glaring deficiencies that are technically trivial (but sometimes culturally difficult) to fix. When I was at Google, we had really bad communication problems between the two halves of our team that were in different locations. My fix was brain-dead simple: I started typing up meeting notes for all of our local meetings and discussions and taking questions from the remote team about things that surprised them in our notes. That's something anyone could have done, and it was a huge productivity improvement for the entire team. I've literally never found an environment where you can't massively improve productivity with something that trivial. Sometimes people don't agree (e.g., it took months to get the non-version-control-using-team to use version control), but that's a topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers are woefully underutilized at most companies. What's the point of &lt;a href=&quot;http://danluu.com/wat/&quot;&gt;hiring &quot;the best&quot; and then crippling them&lt;/a&gt;? You can get better results by hiring undistinguished folks and setting them up for success, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patio11/status/706884144538648576&quot;&gt;it's a lot cheaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started programming, I heard a lot about how programmers are down to earth, not like those elitist folks who have uniforms involving suits and ties. You can even wear t-shirts to work! But if you think programmers aren't elitist, try wearing a suit and tie to an interview sometime. You'll have to go above and beyond to prove that you're not a bad cultural fit. We like to think that we're different from all those industries that judge people based on appearance, but we do the same thing, only instead of saying that people are a bad fit because they don't wear ties, we say they're a bad fit because they do, and instead of saying people aren't smart enough because they don't have the right pedigree… wait, that's exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Context: development started in 2002 by Sysoev when he was Rambler employee (as sysadmin). Rambler never claimed copyright on nginx. Later Nginx Inc. was founded to provide commercial services. This year &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/F5Networks&quot; class=&quot;twitter-atreply dir-ltr&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-mentioned-user-id=&quot;15136500&quot; data-screenname=&quot;F5Networks&quot;&gt;@F5Networks&lt;/a&gt; bought Nginx Inc., and Sberbank bought 46.5% of Rambler Group.</description>
