<title>Dieter Rams designed products to last, is horrified how we throw things away</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;published&quot;&gt;Posted &lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;April 06, 2019 06:00:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-portrait-photo-1/10974454&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10974412-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A man with white hair and glasses looks at the camera.&quot; title=&quot;Dieter Rams portrait photo&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-portrait-photo-1/10974454&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; Dieter Rams was Braun's design director from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Gary Hustwit)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;inline-caption&quot; href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/?q=51,9(Germany)&amp;amp;z=5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear quite often that less is more, but what about less is better? Those are the words of designer Dieter Rams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, Rams made an indelible mark on product design, predominantly at the German electronics company Braun, with a focus on function over form and products that would last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of his influence are extraordinary — a legacy that transformed the nature of consumer products and, some would argue, defined the concept of good design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams was the design director at Braun from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s. He was in charge of the look and function of more than 500 consumer products. He helped the founding Braun brothers create everything from radios and alarm clocks to juicers and razors and even record players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-in-his-home-1/10974622&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10974536-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A man with white hair and glasses operates a radio.&quot; title=&quot;Dieter Rams in his home&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-in-his-home-1/10974622&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; A wall-mounted hi-fi and T1000 multiband radio are among the products that fill Rams' home. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Gary Hustwit)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 86, Rams lives in Wiesbaden, Germany. A Porsche is parked out the front of a boxy modernist house with a made-for-Instagram interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rooms are filled with a tasteful array of products he designed decades ago: the olive green Braun coffee maker; his wall-mounted hi-fi; and the iconic calculator (check your iPhone number-cruncher for a modern-day homage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams, his life, his work and his legacy, is the subject of a new documentary from Gary Hustwit, who made the typeface documentary Helvetica in 2007. The title of this film, like his work, is simple: Rams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Function over form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Dieter-Rams-designed product had a special look: &quot;There was always kind of a very simple aesthetic to them. They looked very clean,&quot; says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In some ways, Rams' work really did affect a lot of people's lives, even though they probably aren't aware of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, post World War II, a democratic simplicity emerged that had never been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were just trying to kind of make something new and something that made sense to them,&quot; says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This idea of ornamentation and Art Deco from the 1930s and 40s, was something that they wanted to just really get away from. It was about this new, industrial aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content wysiwyg right&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More stories from Blueprint for Living:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter was influenced by the Bauhaus, the German school. It was a component of modernism and a lot of different disciplines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams and his team worked to distil a design down to only the crucial components. The idea was to arrive at form following function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're not just designing products from the outside — what they're going to look like — and then figuring out how they work,&quot; says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're going to design the insides, the guts of something, and then the outside form is going to be reflective of that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Snow White's Coffin'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example, Rams' SK4 record player for Braun, which has two speakers at the front, a simple rectangle of Plexiglass forming the lid, a turntable and a radio dial on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in 1956, It was lovingly named &quot;Snow White's Coffin&quot; and was the first turntable to feature a Plexiglass cover, says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was like a crystal box. But now, today, you think of a record turntable, and of course it's got a Plexiglass cover. It just became part of the vernacular for that object.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular item is available from some resellers for up to $3,000. Perhaps more surprising — &quot;they still work&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They built those things to last, last a lifetime,&quot; Hustwit says. &quot;And if they did break, they built them to be repaired very easily.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/braun-turntable-snow-whites-coffin-1/10974368&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10974320-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white turntable with its plexiglass lid open.&quot; title=&quot;Braun turntable Snow White's Coffin&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/braun-turntable-snow-whites-coffin-1/10974368&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; Braun's SK4 record player, aka 'Snow White's Coffin'. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Gary Hustwit)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of repairability is part of Rams' ethos. &quot;Good design is long-lasting&quot; is one of his core values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams set out the principles he attempted to follow in his work, in what the internet refers to as the &quot;10 Commandments of Good Design&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules, including, &quot;good design is honest&quot;, &quot;good design is environmentally friendly&quot;, and &quot;good design is as little design as possible&quot; have been adopted by other creatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So much of media and products today want to kind of shout, 'Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!',&quot; says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rams' aesthetic, I think, is just the opposite. It's about being in the background until it's needed. An object can do its job, and then go back to the background again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rams and Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/composite-braun-t3-and-ipod-classic-1/10974258&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10974084-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Braun T3 transistor radio and the classic Apple iPod.&quot; title=&quot;COMPOSITE Braun T3 and iPod classic&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/composite-braun-t3-and-ipod-classic-1/10974258&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; Apple's iPod took its cues from the Braun T3 transistor radio — currently on display in the exhibition Interface: People, Machines, Design at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (Powerhouse), Sydney. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Sotha Bourn/Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams' touch can be seen when comparing Braun products with iconic Apple designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hustwit says Steve Jobs and now, Apple's current design director, Jony Ive, were heavily influenced by Rams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The iPhone and the first iPod were really influenced by one of Rams' radio designs from the 1950s, and everything from the Macbook to to the iMac has some sort of Rams' DNA in it,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's interesting because he doesn't have any of these things. Actually, he does have an iPhone that Jony and the Apple design team gave him. It's on his desk, it's like a paperweight, he doesn't use the phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Less but better'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-in-1970s-1/10974694&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10974672-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A black and white photo of a man looking at design plans.&quot; title=&quot;Dieter Rams in 1970s&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-05/dieter-rams-in-1970s-1/10974694&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; Hustwit says Rams, pictured here in the 1970s, likely became tired of designing the same thing over and over again. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(Supplied: Abisag Tullman)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the opening scene of the film, Rams is reading and typing a statement on his red Olivetti Valentine typewriter in which he says something like: &quot;The time of thoughtless design for thoughtless consumption is over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was from a speech Rams gave at a design event in New York in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They always built these things as if you were going to keep them for the rest of your life,&quot; says Hustwit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think what happened in the 70s and 80s was a lot of product design got more marketing-driven. It was about: 'OK, what's the new thing this season? What's the new hairdryer or the new blender?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hustwit believes Rams eventually left Braun because &quot;he was tired of designing the same thing over and over again for no reason&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He doesn't feel like he's responsible [for consumerism], but I think he definitely feels like he had a role in getting to where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think he looks at our modern world of throwaway products and hyper-consumerism in horror, really. They were trying to make honest products that would last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's something that is not the case anymore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Linux-based 4G phones with Google Assistant sold for $7 in Indonesia</title>
<link>https://tuxphones.com/smart-feature-phones-revolution-kai-os/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the first iPhone in 2007, the whole mobile industry has moved to the &quot;smartphone&quot; form factor: minimal hardware keys, touch screen navigation, desktop-like Internet capabilities. However, while the revolution was more than welcome for most aspects, things like battery life and overall device dimensions are still missed by most users. Another important factor is the price, as smartphones need gigabytes of relatively expensive RAM and storage, powerful CPUs and wide screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tuxphones.com/content/images/2019/03/smart-feature-phones-Counterpoint-Research-kaios.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Smart feature phones boom: 73.6m vs 20.8m sold in 2018
&lt;p&gt;However, the situation seems to be still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KaiOS&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Linux-based OS&lt;/strong&gt; designed with feature phones in mind, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/26/kaios-third-mobile-operating-system/&quot;&gt;became the &lt;strong&gt;third most popular smartphone OS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The same OS just received &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/google-kaios/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;$20m funding from Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaiostech.com/mwc-2019-kai-reinforces-smart-feature-phone-leader-position-through-new-sweeping-partnerships/&quot;&gt;partnered with them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tuxphones.com/content/images/2019/03/google-wizphone-kai-os-smart-feature-phone.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The Google WizPhone is a $7 feature phone that runs Linux &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dealntech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-wizphone.jpg&quot;&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, &lt;strong&gt;modern feature phones sold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaiostech.com/the-first-kaios-powered-smart-feature-phone-arrives-in-indonesia-a-new-partnership-model-combining-retail-and-banking-to-advance-financial-inclusion/&quot;&gt;as little as $7 in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; now sport official Google Assistant, WhatsApp and YouTube apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, a report mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaiostech.com/the-birth-of-the-smart-feature-phone-revolution/&quot;&gt;latest KaiOS blog post&lt;/a&gt; shows an &lt;strong&gt;increase of over 250%&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;smart feature phones&lt;/em&gt; sales between 2017 and 2018. Sure, those devices will not run 3D games or have 4K video recording, but does that matter more excellent battery life or price to most average users?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rise of Candida auris embodies a serious and growing public health threat</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last May, an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery. A blood test revealed that he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious. Doctors swiftly isolated him in the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. Over the last five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/myc.12781&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;swept through a hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit, and taken root in India, Pakistan and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073876/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but C. auris did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,” said Dr. Scott Lorin, the hospital’s president. “The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;C. auris is so tenacious, in part, because it is impervious to major antifungal medications, making it a new example of one of the world’s most intractable health threats: the rise of drug-resistant infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For decades, public health experts have warned that the overuse of antibiotics was reducing the effectiveness of drugs that have lengthened life spans by curing bacterial infections once commonly fatal. But lately, there has been an explosion of resistant fungi as well, adding a new and frightening dimension to a phenomenon that is undermining a pillar of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s an enormous problem,” said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London, who was a co-author of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/739&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent scientific review&lt;/a&gt; on the rise of resistant fungi. “We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Simply put, fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet even as world health leaders have pleaded for more restraint in prescribing antimicrobial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi — convening the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 to manage an emerging crisis — gluttonous overuse of them in hospitals, clinics and farming has continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Resistant germs are often called “superbugs,” but this is simplistic because they don’t typically kill everyone. Instead, they are most lethal to people with immature or compromised immune systems, including newborns and the elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who take steroids that suppress the body’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scientists say that unless more effective new medicines are developed and unnecessary use of antimicrobial drugs is sharply curbed, risk will spread to healthier populations. A study the British government funded &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://amr-review.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; that if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance, 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050, eclipsing the eight million expected to die that year from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the United States, two million people contract resistant infections annually, and 23,000 die from them, according to the official C.D.C. estimate. That number was based on 2010 figures; more recent estimates &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/reestimating-annual-deaths-due-to-multidrugresistant-organism-infections/C9B09A787FCCA1EA992AF45066F3FF7C&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; put the death toll at 162,000. Worldwide fatalities from resistant infections are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://amr-review.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;estimated at 700,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Antibiotics and antifungals are both essential to combat infections in people, but antibiotics are also used widely to prevent disease in farm animals, and antifungals are also applied to prevent agricultural plants from rotting. Some scientists cite evidence that rampant use of fungicides on crops is contributing to the surge in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet as the problem grows, it is little understood by the public — in part because the very existence of resistant infections is often cloaked in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With bacteria and fungi alike, hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as infection hubs. Even the C.D.C., under its agreement with states, is not allowed to make public the location or name of hospitals involved in outbreaks. State governments have in many cases declined to publicly share information beyond acknowledging that they have had cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;All the while, the germs are easily spread — carried on hands and equipment inside hospitals; ferried on meat and manure-fertilized vegetables from farms; transported across borders by travelers and on exports and imports; and transferred by patients from nursing home to hospital and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;C. auris, which infected the man at Mount Sinai, is one of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of dangerous bacteria and fungi that have developed resistance. Yet, like most of them, it is a threat that is virtually unknown to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other prominent strains of the fungus Candida — one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections in hospitals — have not developed significant resistance to drugs, but more than 90 percent of C. auris infections are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more drugs, the C.D.C. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Lynn Sosa, Connecticut’s deputy state epidemiologist, said she now saw C. auris as “the top” threat among resistant infections. “It’s pretty much unbeatable and difficult to identity,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It is a creature from the black lagoon,” said Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads the fungal branch at the C.D.C., which is spearheading a global detective effort to find treatments and stop the spread. “It bubbled up and now it is everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-a7e1537&quot;&gt;‘No need’ to tell the public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In late 2015, Dr. Johanna Rhodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital, a British medical center outside London. C. auris had taken root there months earlier, and the hospital couldn’t clear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“‘We have no idea where it’s coming from. We’ve never heard of it. It’s just spread like wildfire,’” Dr. Rhodes said she was told. She agreed to help the hospital identify the fungus’s genetic profile and clean it from rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under her direction, hospital workers used a special device to spray aerosolized hydrogen peroxide around a room used for a patient with C. auris, the theory being that the vapor would scour each nook and cranny. They left the device going for a week. Then they put a “settle plate” in the middle of the room with a gel at the bottom that would serve as a place for any surviving microbes to grow, Dr. Rhodes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Only one organism grew back. C. auris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was spreading, but word of it was not. The hospital, a specialty lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak,” said Oliver Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world. Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients — or prospective ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;&quot;Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant, which is really mind-boggling,&quot; said Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a fungal expert and epidemiologist at the C.D.C.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Melissa Golden for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Silke Schelenz, Royal Brompton’s infectious disease specialist, found the lack of urgency from the government and hospital in the early stages of the outbreak “very, very frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They obviously didn’t want to lose reputation,” Dr. Schelenz said. “It hadn’t impacted our surgical outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-016-0132-5&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported “an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases”&lt;/a&gt; at Royal Brompton, and the hospital took an extraordinary step: It shut down its I.C.U. for 11 days, moving intensive care patients to another floor, again with no announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem. A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/intensive-care-unit-closed-as-three-people-die-from-new-superbug/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;headline&lt;/a&gt; in The Daily Telegraph warned, “Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges in the U.K.” (Later research said there were eventually 72 total cases, though some patients were only carriers and were not infected by the fungus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet the issue remained little known internationally, while an even bigger outbreak had begun in Valencia, Spain, at the 992-bed Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe. There, unbeknown to the public or unaffected patients, 372 people were colonized — meaning they had the germ on their body but were not sick with it — and 85 developed bloodstream infections. A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/myc.12781&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper in the journal Mycoses&lt;/a&gt; reported that 41 percent of the infected patients died within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A statement from the hospital said it was not necessarily C. auris that killed them. “It is very difficult to discern whether patients die from the pathogen or with it, since they are patients with many underlying diseases and in very serious general condition,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As with Royal Brompton, the hospital in Spain did not make any public announcement. It still has not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One author of the article in Mycoses, a doctor at the hospital, said in an email that the hospital did not want him to speak to journalists because it “is concerned about the public image of the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The secrecy infuriates patient advocates, who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak so they can decide whether to go to a hospital, particularly when dealing with a nonurgent matter, like elective surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Outside the Royal Brompton Hospital near London. By June 2016, the hospital had seen at least 50 “proven or possible” cases of C. auris, and decided to shut down its intensive care unit for 11 days to address the contamination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Jamieson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year and a half later — and not have it front-page news the day after it happens?” said Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, a physician in Kentucky and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.healthwatchusa.org/HWUSA-Officers/bios/_Kavanagh.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;board chairman of Health Watch USA&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit patient advocacy group. “You wouldn’t tolerate this at a restaurant with a food poisoning outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Health officials say that disclosing outbreaks frightens patients about a situation they can do nothing about, particularly when the risks are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s hard enough with these organisms for health care providers to wrap their heads around it,” said Dr. Anna Yaffee, a former C.D.C. outbreak investigator who dealt with resistant infection outbreaks in Kentucky in which the hospitals were not publicly disclosed. “It’s really impossible to message to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Officials in London did alert the C.D.C. to the Royal Brompton outbreak while it was occurring. And the C.D.C. realized it needed to get the word to American hospitals. On June 24, 2016, the C.D.C. blasted a nationwide warning to hospitals and medical groups and set up an email address, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;mailto:candidaauris@cdc.gov&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;candidaauris@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt;, to field queries. Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a key member of the fungal team, expected to get a trickle — “maybe a message every month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Instead, within weeks, her inbox exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-12b78991&quot;&gt;Coming to America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the United States, 587 cases of people having contracted C. auris have been reported, concentrated with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois, according to the C.D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The symptoms — fever, aches and fatigue — are seemingly ordinary, but when a person gets infected, particularly someone already unhealthy, such commonplace symptoms can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The earliest known case in the United States involved a woman who arrived at a New York hospital on May 6, 2013, seeking care for respiratory failure. She was 61 and from the United Arab Emirates, and she died a week later, after testing positive for the fungus. At the time, the hospital hadn’t thought much of it, but three years later, it sent the case to the C.D.C. after reading the agency’s June 2016 advisory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This woman probably was not America’s first C. auris patient. She carried a strain different from the South Asian one most common here. It killed a 56-year-old American woman who had traveled to India in March 2017 for elective abdominal surgery, contracted C. auris and was airlifted back to a hospital in Connecticut that officials will not identify. She was later transferred to a Texas hospital, where she died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The germ has spread into long-term care facilities. In Chicago, 50 percent of the residents at some nursing homes have tested positive for it, the C.D.C. has reported. The fungus can grow on intravenous lines and ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Workers who care for patients infected with C. auris worry for their own safety. Dr. Matthew McCarthy, who has treated several C. auris patients at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, described experiencing an unusual fear when treating a 30-year-old man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I found myself not wanting to touch the guy,” he said. “I didn’t want to take it from the guy and bring it to someone else.” He did his job and thoroughly examined the patient, but said, “There was an overwhelming feeling of being terrified of accidentally picking it up on a sock or tie or gown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the C.D.C. works to limit the spread of drug-resistant C. auris, its investigators have been trying to answer the vexing question: Where in the world did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The first time doctors encountered C. auris was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19161556&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in the ear&lt;/a&gt; of a woman in Japan in 2009 (auris is Latin for ear). It seemed innocuous at the time, a cousin of common, easily treated fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Three years later, it appeared in an unusual test result in the lab of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ecmm.info/fecmm/fellows/meis-jacques/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Jacques Meis&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who was analyzing a bloodstream infection in 18 patients from four hospitals in India. Soon, new clusters of C. auris seemed to emerge with each passing month in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The C.D.C. investigators theorized that C. auris started in Asia and spread across the globe. But when the agency compared the entire genome of auris samples from India and Pakistan, Venezuela, South Africa and Japan, it found that its origin was not a single place, and there was not a single auris strain.&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States, two million people contract resistant infections each year, and 23,000 die from them, according to the official C.D.C. estimate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Melissa Golden for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The genome sequencing showed that there were four distinctive versions of the fungus, with differences so profound that they suggested that these strains had diverged thousands of years ago and emerged as resistant pathogens from harmless environmental strains in four different places at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant, which is really mind-boggling,” Dr. Vallabhaneni said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There are different theories as to what happened with C. auris. Dr. Meis, the Dutch researcher, said he believed that drug-resistant fungi were developing thanks to heavy use of fungicides on crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Meis became intrigued by resistant fungi when he heard about the case of a 63-year-old patient in the Netherlands who died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus. It proved resistant to a front-line antifungal treatment called itraconazole. That drug is a virtual copy of the azole pesticides that are used to dust crops the world over and account for more than &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812019/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one-third of all fungicide sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A 2013 &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003633&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in Plos Pathogens said that it appeared to be no coincidence that drug-resistant Aspergillus was showing up in the environment where the azole fungicides were used. The fungus appeared in 12 percent of Dutch soil samples, for example, but also in “flower beds, compost, leaves, plant seeds, soil samples of tea gardens, paddy fields, hospital surroundings, and aerial samples of hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Meis visited the C.D.C. last summer to share research and theorize that the same thing is happening with C. auris, which is also found in the soil: Azoles have created an environment so hostile that the fungi are evolving, with resistant strains surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is similar to concerns that resistant bacteria are growing because of excessive use of antibiotics in livestock for health and growth promotion. As with antibiotics in farm animals, azoles are used widely on crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“On everything — potatoes, beans, wheat, anything you can think of, tomatoes, onions,” said Dr. Rhodes, the infectious disease specialist who worked on the London outbreak. “We are driving this with the use of antifungicides on crops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Chiller theorizes that C. auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides. His idea is that C. auris actually has existed for thousands of years, hidden in the world’s crevices, a not particularly aggressive bug. But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi, an opportunity arrived for C. auris to enter the breach, a germ that had the ability to readily resist fungicides now suitable for a world in which fungi less able to resist are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The mystery of C. auris’s emergence remains unsolved, and its origin seems, for the moment, to be less important than stopping its spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-2cd3b84d&quot;&gt;Resistance and denial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For now, the uncertainty around C. auris has led to a climate of fear, and sometimes denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last spring, Jasmine Cutler, 29, went to visit her 72-year-old father at a hospital in New York City, where he had been admitted because of complications from a surgery the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When she arrived at his room, she discovered that he had been sitting for at least an hour in a recliner, in his own feces, because no one had come when he had called for help to use the bathroom. Ms. Cutler said it became clear to her that the staff was afraid to touch him because a test had shown that he was carrying C. auris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I saw doctors and nurses looking in the window of his room,” she said. “My father’s not a guinea pig. You’re not going to treat him like a freak at a show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was eventually discharged and told he no longer carried the fungus. But he declined to be named, saying he feared being associated with the frightening infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;SQL is the only ever successful, mainstream, and general-purpose 4GL (Fourth Generation Programming Language) and it is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With modern cost based optimisation, relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL finally keep up to the promise of a powerful declarative programming model by adapting to ever changing productive data without performance penalties. Thousand-line-long, complex SQL statements can be run in far below a millisecond against billion-row strong tables if database developers know their ways around the SQL language - and the best news is: It's not that hard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show how the SQL database will constantly outperform any hand written data retrieval algorithm - or in other words - how SQL, being a logic language, is the best language for business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quirk-cbt/id1447026451?mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download iOS&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.econn.quirk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download Android&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:humans@usequirk.com&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;https://timeline.noticeable.io/Eg17gkp9Nga9OcrvjToA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirk is a crossplatform, GPL-licensed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&lt;/a&gt; app built in React Native / Expo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about your mood or ask you to do depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5942769/54972305-4081d180-4f48-11e9-91d8-7e8117668418.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5942769/54972305-4081d180-4f48-11e9-91d8-7e8117668418.gif&quot; alt=&quot;quirk screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirk is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;node&lt;/a&gt; installed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt; is preferred over NPM as a package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; clone the project and cd into it&lt;/span&gt;
git clone git@github.com:Flaque/quirk.git&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ./quirk

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; install dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
yarn

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; start development environment&lt;/span&gt;
yarn start
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll then be in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expo development environment&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have XCode installed with a simulator, you can just press &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to start it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirk's goal is to be both inviting and focused. It should be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy to enter in a thought; people frequently enter these in public settings and need to do it fairly quickly. It also should not cause any increased frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design Logic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qurik is built with two main goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't be bloated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be evil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don't be bloated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include features for one particular condition at the expense of other conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, don't couple mood tracking to thought tracking. If a user &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to enter a mood in order to track a thought, then the entire app is ruined for people who use it for panic, OCD or another condition where mood isn't the primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include non-CBT related treatments without good reason.&lt;/strong&gt; No relaxation audio tracks or meditation guides. It's a CBT app, keep it focused on CBT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include things that could be better acomplished by another app.&lt;/strong&gt; No one needs an in-app diary when a diary works just fine. No one needs an in-app heart rate tracker when a heart rate tracker works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be quick and efficent.&lt;/strong&gt; Thoughts shouldn't take 5 minutes to enter and you should be able to skip fields if it's reasonable. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't be Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.&lt;/strong&gt; Most people would rather give over their passwords than their CBT thoughts. They're incredibly private, occasionally involve other people, and frequently are embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't have $200 dollar in app purchases.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm looking at you CBT Thought Diary. I get it, developers need to make money. It costs a lot to just keep the app on the app store. But you're preying on vulnerable people. Very few people of rational mind will purposely spend $200s for a dark mode. Gimme a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't have dumb notifications.&lt;/strong&gt; Scheduling is fine, abusing push notifications so your app has better traffic is scummy and gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be open.&lt;/strong&gt; Not every app has to be open source; it's a hard choice to make. But be clear and obvious within the app about what's going on with the user's data. Don't be sending it to some server without making that clear within the app, not within some dumb privacy policy no one will ever read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't push people to be unhappy.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot believe I have to state this, but do not purposefully or accidentally force people to be unhappy to use their app. Don't force people to state their unhappy in order to access a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.&lt;/strong&gt; User engagement is fine to be concerned about. We all want people who need help to be actually engaging in the help. But holy moly becareful about this. You &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want to drive something that is for many people a treatment into a self-perpetuating engagement loop. A ruthless focus on engagement has caused many a product to become skinner boxes. &lt;em&gt;No one should ever be addicted to your mental health app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirk &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;/em&gt; lose user data. The entire point of the app is to record your thoughts, so if you lost them it would be pretty bad. As stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010839/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an app failure in general can be inconvenient and annoying, it can have serious consequences in the context of mental health apps—someone who has come to rely on an app for emotional support can find a failure “devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, data management should be given a higher priority than any other part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxonomy and Order of Data Failure Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of extremely &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; behaviors and states that could happen in order of severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1 - Large Scale Data Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thoughts have been corrupted somehow. For example, the JSON format of every item is wrong. This is put at the top because not only can a user not access the data, but it may spiral out can cause continuing errors forcing the app to be &quot;bricked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 - Large Scale Data Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thoughts have been deleted without any hope of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3 - Small Scale Data Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small amount of data has been deleted without any hope of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4 - Small Scale Data Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small amount of data has been corrupted in a recoverable way. The user still has lost data, but the app does not crash, and this is potentially fixable via an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain Motel 6 has agreed to pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the state of Washington after several locations gave information on thousands of guests to Immigration and Customs Enforcement without warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Thursday that Motel 6 shared the information of about 80,000 guests in the state from 2015 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to targeted investigations of guests with Latino-sounding names, according to Ferguson. He said many guests faced questioning from ICE, detainment or deportation as a result of the disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the second settlement over the company's practice in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motel 6 also has signed a legally binding &lt;a href=&quot;https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/ConsentDecreeMotel6.pdf&quot;&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; to no longer share guest information without a warrant at any of its locations nationwide, a practice the chain says it has already ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,&quot; Ferguson said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-motel-6-will-pay-12m-violating-privacy-tens-thousands-washingtonians&quot;&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Our resolution holds Motel 6 accountable for illegally handing over guests' private information without a warrant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company told NPR in an emailed statement that, as part of the agreement, it would &quot;continue to enforce its guest privacy policy, which prohibits the sharing of guest information except in cases where a judicially enforceable warrant or subpoena is present, or local law requires this information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company has also implemented a system of additional controls to ensure corporate oversight and compliance in cases where law enforcement requests are made.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/motel-6-calling-ice-undocumented-guests-phoenix-immigration-lawyers-9683244&quot;&gt;The Phoenix New Times&lt;/a&gt; first uncovered the practice in September 2017 when reporter Antonia Farzan investigated two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We got a tip that this was happening, started talking to local immigration attorneys and definitely kept hearing from people that this was a trend,&quot; Farzan told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2017/09/15/551339907/motel-6-locations-in-phoenix-share-guest-lists-with-ice-agents&quot;&gt;NPR's Ari Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; at the time. &quot;They didn't really know what was behind it but that they kept seeing people get picked up at Motel 6.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following initial media reports, Motel 6 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/motel6/status/908453005296619521&quot;&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the practice had been discontinued and that it would issue a directive to each of its locations to clarify &quot;that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE.&quot; The hotel said at the time that the practice was implemented &quot;at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/04/575567251/motel-6-gave-guest-information-to-immigration-agents-lawsuit-says&quot;&gt;sued the company&lt;/a&gt; a few months later, alleging employees at seven locations in the Puget Sound region violated state consumer-protection law when they also released guest information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson said at the time that the hotels would turn over entire guest lists to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to our interviews with employees at Motel 6,&quot; he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/01/06/576197682/washington-state-sues-motel-6-over-sharing-guest-immigration-data&quot;&gt;told NPR's Scott Simon&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;ICE agents would circle the names that looked Latino-sounding and ran those names through a database and then would detain individuals based on those random checks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res710146517&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage664737581&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/11/06/664737581/motel-6-agrees-to-pay-millions-after-giving-guest-lists-to-immigration-authoriti&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/11\/06\/664737581\/motel-6-agrees-to-pay-millions-after-giving-guest-lists-to-immigration-authoriti&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/11/06/ap_18190606841302_sq-08a5bd63c0d56943c9d26d8ec554941d5f409b33-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/11/06/ap_18190606841302_sq-08a5bd63c0d56943c9d26d8ec554941d5f409b33-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Motel 6 Agrees To Pay Millions After Giving Guest Lists To Immigration Authorities &quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement from Ferguson about Thursday's settlement detailed several cases of guests whose names were provided to ICE, including one Seattle man who stayed at a Motel 6 near Sea-Tac for one night, wrapping Christmas presents for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;ICE agents approached him in the hotel's parking lot, detained him and deported him some days later,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;The man was the sole provider for the household, and his wife is currently struggling to support their toddler and four other children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motel 6 has agreed to also train its employees not to release guest information improperly and maintain a 24-hour hotline to help employees when they receive requests for information. The company will also be required to create a tool on its website for guests to report possible violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state says more than $10 million of the settlement fund will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atg.wa.gov/motel-6-settlement-claim-information&quot;&gt;paid out&lt;/a&gt; to affected guests — including those who did not have any contact with ICE after their information was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Motel 6 settled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665833059/motel-6-agrees-to-pay-7-6-million-to-former-guests-to-settle-lawsuit&quot;&gt;a separate lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in Arizona by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. That lawsuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/23/580149434/motel-6-sued-for-identifying-latino-guests-for-immigration-agents&quot;&gt;identified eight Latino plaintiffs&lt;/a&gt; who were detained, including one who was deported.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Battery Power&amp;#039;s Latest Plunge in Costs Threatens Coal, Gas</title>
<link>https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;London and New York, March 26, 2019&lt;/em&gt; – Two technologies that were immature and expensive only a few years ago but are now at the center of the unfolding low-carbon energy transition have seen spectacular gains in cost-competitiveness in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest analysis by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF) shows that the benchmark levelized cost of electricity,&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or LCOE, for lithium-ion batteries has fallen 35% to $187 per megawatt-hour since the first half of 2018. Meanwhile, the benchmark LCOE for offshore wind has tumbled by 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onshore wind and photovoltaic solar have also gotten cheaper, their respective benchmark LCOE reaching $50 and $57 per megawatt-hour for projects starting construction in early 2019, down 10% and 18% on the equivalent figures of a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Giannakopoulou, head of energy economics at BNEF, commented: “Looking back over this decade, there have been staggering improvements in the cost-competitiveness of these low-carbon options, thanks to technology innovation, economies of scale, stiff price competition and manufacturing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis shows that the LCOE per megawatt-hour for onshore wind, solar PV and offshore wind have fallen by 49%, 84% and 56% respectively since 2010. That for lithium-ion battery storage has dropped by 76% since 2012, based on recent project costs and historical battery pack prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking finding in this LCOE Update, for the first-half of 2019, is on the cost improvements in lithium-ion batteries. These are opening up new opportunities for them to balance a renewables-heavy generation mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries co-located with solar or wind projects are starting to compete, in many markets and without subsidy, with coal- and gas-fired generation for the provision of ‘dispatchable power’ that can be delivered whenever the grid needs it (as opposed to only when the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity demand is subject to pronounced peaks and lows inter-day. Meeting the peaks has previously been the preserve of technologies such as open-cycle gas turbines and gas reciprocating engines, but these are now facing competition from batteries with anything from one to four hours of energy storage, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tifenn Brandily, energy economics analyst at BNEF, said: “Solar PV and onshore wind have won the race to be the cheapest sources of new ‘bulk generation’ in most countries, but the encroachment of clean technologies is now going well beyond that, threatening the balancing role that gas-fired plant operators, in particular, have been hoping to play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore wind has often been seen as a relatively expensive generation option compared to onshore wind or solar PV. However, auction programs for new capacity, combined with much larger turbines, have produced sharp reductions in capital costs, taking BNEF’s global benchmark for this technology below $100 per MWh, compared to more than $220 just five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannakopoulou said: “The low prices promised by offshore wind tenders throughout Europe are now materializing, with several high-profile projects reaching financial close in recent months. Its cost decline in the last six months is the sharpest we have seen for any technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the LCOE of solar PV has fallen 18% in the last year, the great majority of that decline happened in the third quarter of 2018, when a shift in Chinese policy caused there to be a huge global supply glut of modules, rather than over the most recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNEF’s LCOE analysis is based on information on real projects starting construction and proprietary pricing information from suppliers. Its database covers nearly 7,000 projects across 20 technologies (including the various types of coal, gas and nuclear generation as well as renewables), situated in 46 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Computer Graphics from Scratch (2017)</title>
<link>http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; This book will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Graphics from scratch&lt;/strong&gt; is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence &lt;strong&gt;“from scratch”&lt;/strong&gt;. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is divided in two main parts, &lt;strong&gt;Raytracing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rasterization&lt;/strong&gt;, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The &lt;strong&gt;Common concepts&lt;/strong&gt; chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, &lt;em&gt;sample code&lt;/em&gt;, written in the most &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt; way possible, which may not be the most &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt; way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strenghts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a &lt;code&gt;canvas&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-read-this&quot;&gt;Why read this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaders&lt;/strong&gt;. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun&lt;/strong&gt;. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-in-progress&quot;&gt;Work in progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Texture filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textures in the raytracer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection in the rasterizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra appendix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make demos interactive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up demo code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contribute or to correct mistakes - all the text, diagrams and demos are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. PRs welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-author&quot;&gt;About the author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer who founded and ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysterystudio.com&quot;&gt;game development company&lt;/a&gt; (which you haven’t heard of), worked at Google (which you have heard of), and now works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://improbable.io&quot;&gt;Improbable&lt;/a&gt; (who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real - or at the very least revolutionise multiplayer game development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught Computer Graphics for 5 years at my university, where it was a semester-long 3rd year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that have inspired this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other interests besides Computer Graphics, engineering-related and otherwise. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://gabrielgambetta.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; for more details and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
