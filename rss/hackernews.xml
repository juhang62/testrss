<title>Reality Driven Development: Fixing Project Management in Software</title>
<link>http://www.brightball.com/articles/reality-driven-development-fixing-project-management-in-software</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.brightball.com/articles/reality-driven-development-fixing-project-management-in-software</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of people know this about me, but I've almost exited programming at three different times in my career...because I wanted to get into project management at a high level. Ever since my first project management class in grad school, it just made sense to me...but after about 15 years in software it doesn't anymore. Let me explain how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A little background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in undergrad at Clemson, there were certain classes that just clicked with me immediately and other classes that I forced my way through because they were required. Computer Science clicked with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two other subjects in all of undergrad did that: Psychology and Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to grad school I enrolled in an experimental Masters program at Clemson called eCommerce. It was run by the College of Business and only a few courses different from the MBA...except you could take 800 level Comp Sci classes. At the time, that was appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, the name of the degree mattered a whole lot more because nobody has any idea what a Masters in eCommerce actually means. Eventually, the department also realized that problem and changed the program to an MBA &quot;with emphasis in eCommerce.&quot; Unfortunately that didn't apply retroactively. I always chuckle when I see professional signatures with &quot;My Name, MBA&quot; wondering what people would think if I started writing &quot;Barry Jones, MeC&quot; on mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, I gained a lot from the curriculum, but one class stood out above all others: Project Management. Project Management is essentially Psychology + Economics when you break it all down, so in hindsight the appeal is more understandable. I'm also a big fan of poker, as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I was hired for my first major programming job at a big business telecom company I was attending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pmi.org/&quot; target=&quot;pmi&quot;&gt;Project Management Institute&lt;/a&gt; (PMI) meetings, signing up for membership, learning more about the subject and trying to figure out how to count my hours so that I could take the test to get my Project Management Profession Certification (PMP). For my entire career, I’ve paid careful attention to how projects were managed through the lens of eventually wanting to shift my career that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came very close to finally making the time to get my PMP about 2 years into that first job. An interesting opportunity came up at a smaller contract web development company, so instead I focused on the work for multiple clients...at the same time...with competing deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left that job to start Brightball, a huge part of it was wanting to structure a company to only handle large projects. The prior company was doing both small, design focused CMS projects &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; big web projects but the resources weren't managed any differently...and it was wearing the developers out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year into Brightball, the recession hit and things got harder. I've written the story of the company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brightball.com/articles/what-exactly-happened-to-brightball-for-hire&quot; target=&quot;what-happened&quot;&gt;elsewhere already if you're curious&lt;/a&gt;. After we shut down, I went back to the big telecom again, in a production support team role this time. It was a term limited contract, so I was constantly looking at other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to re-enroll in PMI to pursue my PMP when I was presented with another big opportunity that resulted in the most chaotic learning experience of my career until it was clear I had to move on...largely because of issues created by project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I re-enrolled in PMI and started actively pursuing my PMP. It was time for a career change. The only way to fix project management in software was going to be for me to become a project manager. From the programmer side...it just wasn't happening. No matter your background, you get into an organization with a label of your job title and you become &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; that job title&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I ended up in another great opportunity and ended up dropping out of the PMP course again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No More Mr. PMP Guy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was five years ago and I have no plans to pursue my PMP at any point in the future. Because what you learn to get your PMP and what you need to manage software projects are not the same set of skills...and nobody seems to realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That core problem creates so much friction between software teams and project managers...and the business people who those project managers report to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not the project manager's fault. They know exactly what they were taught in regard to how project management is supposed to work. Those principles actually do work extremely well in many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; industries. PMP focuses almost entirely on Waterfall methodology and gaining the certification is largely driven by terminology and math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But software is a special snowflake in the project management world and this is why countless books around managing software continue to be written. It is an unsolved problem that nobody has managed to get correct because understanding the psychology of how software developers work plays a much more significant role. It’s not as simple as organizational business rules, estimates and dependencies when &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; people work can sway timelines dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to do my best for the rest of this post to translate 15 years of software and project management experience into a simple, cohesive formula that can make your company better. There's no need for a book. No need for consultants. If you'd like to pay me to email this link to your boss, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brightball.com/contact/new&quot; target=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;contact us form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read from the next paragraph down a couple of times until it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Level Project Management Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary forms of project management that we see used in software are Waterfall and Agile. Under the Agile umbrella, we have Scrum and Kanban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waterfall Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfall thrives in environments where everything can be planned up front. Construction is a good example, where you can have architects draw up plans for a building complete with resources needed. The cost of resources, time to acquire them, order of assembly, time to construct each phase, licensed professionals and necessary equipment can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all of that, it becomes a problem of optimizing concurrency against the budget to minimize the timeline. When is Bob going to finish with X so that he can complete Y before Tim needs it to start Z? That shortest point on the timeline is dictated by the critical path, on which any time increases will affect the time for the entire project. There are software tools that excel in managing this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a business finance perspective, this is the dream. This thing will cost $X and be ready in a specific amount of time. It's accurate enough that entire contracts are entered into around these types of numbers with penalties for not hitting the deadlines. You can plan multiple projects and accurately decide to execute based on the expected Return on Investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in software...everything is not known up front, in fact…most things are not known up front. Acknowledgment of that is usually where the transition to Scrum begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scrum Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Scrum is to isolate chunks of work into sprints. Usually a sprint is a 2 or 3 week time period. The development team will meet, look over the backlog of work to be done, estimate how long those tasks will take to complete and then &quot;commit&quot; to what will be done. In some cases, dependencies will be known ahead of time and project managers can still nurture the critical path through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that is the ideal. The reality of Scrum in many organizations is that it's a concession just trying to hide an attempt at Waterfall behind the scenes. If you are developing a system that has not yet been publicly launched, this approach can sometimes do well for a while even despite the problems that begin to surface quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about those in more detail soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kanban Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next in the methodology timeline is Kanban, which in the world of software is a very simple approach. Your developers are generally working on one thing at a time, potentially a second item that is in progress but is on hold for some reason. The backlog is prioritized by management and developers will pull things off of the top of the prioritized queue to work on once they finish the prior task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior task will move to a review phase until it's approved/deployed/done. One of the hard rules of Kanban is a limitation on how may stories can be In Progress or Reviewed at any given time. If things are waiting to be reviewed and haven't been yet, you can't move anything new to the Review phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strict limits to both force teams to address bottlenecks. If a single senior person or team is responsible for &quot;reviews&quot; but are also otherwise occupied by their own work, forcing the rest of the team to stop to wait on them will make it clear quickly that more people need to be able to Review items to keep the team moving. Limiting In Progress items helps developers avoid context switching that significantly negatively impacts productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanban's focus is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanbantool.com/kanban-library/analytics-and-metrics/kanban-definition-of-lead-time-and-cycle-time&quot; target=&quot;cycle-time&quot;&gt;Cycle Time&lt;/a&gt;. How long does something take from the time work begins to the time it is delivered. This creates a focus on &lt;em&gt;organizational efficiency&lt;/em&gt; and barriers to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes software so special?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very real problem faced by software when it comes to project management is estimating. That's before we even factor in what estimating means to different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project management demands timelines. In Waterfall, if we were able to lay out the plan for our entire project from start to finish with all of the task completion dependencies rolled up...we would still have to estimate the time of each task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are estimating tasks that are done over and over, you can look to your historical execution time for insights. We average chopping X logs per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hand you a Rubix Cube and ask you to tell me how long it will take you to solve it...what is your answer going to be? If you've done it before you might have an idea. Maybe you just kept plugging away until you finally solved it? Maybe you've watched one of those videos about how to solve a Rubix Cube, have practiced it and are confident that you could do it in 3 minutes flat? Maybe you have no idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexity and experience will dictate your answers, but then those estimates still only reflect your perception of the task...not everyone else on your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; those numbers are a guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every step in a software project is solving problems. You don't know how long it will take to solve the problem. You don't know how many new problems you might run into along the way. Can the new problems be solved by you or do they need to be solved by other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your project plan is a collection of tasks with highly variable time estimates, where each task can sprout new tasks that may be assigned to other people at any point during the process...it becomes very clear that clinging to that Gantt chart isn't helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is before we've even begun factoring in non-project related tasks in support of existing live systems. Or that different people will have a different concept of what &quot;complete&quot; looks like. Or over-engineering a solution that far exceeds the requirements because someone believed that was the &quot;right way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the thing...as a business person that is hard to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are working with budgets, marketing, press releases, investors...you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; that information to be able to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Look...Scrum!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we shift our expectations and start implementing Scrum. We are now embracing the Agile way of doing things. This seems like a reasonable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will plan the work to be done in 2 week sprints. We'll only estimate a few stories and we will look to past performance to measure our velocity. As long as developers can make a Sprint Commitment then we should have a reasonable expectation of consistent development pace. You lock in the stories for the sprint and focus on getting them done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, the team is excited. Look how much better this is! You're even finishing things early and pulling in new stories to far exceed your commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then yo&lt;/p&gt;
