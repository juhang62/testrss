<title>Nginx to Be Acquired by F5 Networks</title>
<link>https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-joins-f5/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-joins-f5/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly excited that today we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/press/f5-acquires-nginx-to-bridge-netops-and-devops/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; NGINX has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by F5. While there will be a lot of press and formal announcements explaining the reasoning behind the decision, I wanted to share a few words of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built an incredible company, which led to today’s event. As I reflect on how we achieved this success, I landed on three key themes: technology, family, and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How We Got Here: Technology, Family, and Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of NGINX’s success is the amazing technology that Igor Sysoev wrote back in 2002. His decision to open source this technology literally changed the world. You may not see it that way, but the honest truth is that over my six years at the company, almost every user has told me that they couldn’t have built their applications if it wasn’t for NGINX. We wouldn’t have experienced amazing digital experiences like Instagram, Pinterest, Netflix, Airbnb, and hundreds of thousands more apps if it wasn’t for Igor open sourcing NGINX back in 2004. Now there are over &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/&quot;&gt;374M sites&lt;/a&gt; using our software and nearly &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/web_server/ranking&quot;&gt;67% of the highest‑traffic sites&lt;/a&gt; on the Internet. The reality is that whether you know it or not, you use NGINX every day of your life when you post a photo, watch streaming video, purchase goods online, or log into your applications at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this core we built an incredibly talented and passionate family. It’s this family that transformed open source from a technology to a company, and from a company to a market leader. I joined this small family back in 2012 when there were just eight people. Now our family has grown to more than 250 people. Over the years we’ve had people join, leave, get engaged, get divorced, get married, have children (myself included), recover from life‑threatening accidents or illnesses, and, in some cases, lose loved ones. All things that typically happen to an extended family. We’ve lived through these moments together and every single one of these people contributed to our success. It underscores an ethos we live by: mutual accountability. Put simply, it means do your job well and care for each other. That served us incredibly well and I thank &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2017-6&quot;&gt;Jeff Immelt&lt;/a&gt; for sharing this ethos with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the vision. Back in 2012 we didn’t have a commercial offering, only a few support contracts that provided very little revenue. The future was by no means certain. No one in history had built a successful commercial entity around a web server. Many have tried, none with success. One of the founders, Andrew Alexeev, and I spent most of 2013 talking to the largest users of NGINX to learn how they were using the technology, to find inspiration for a commercial offering. We got incredible input from companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, Box, Netflix, LivingSocial, Distil, Yammer, Eventbrite, and many more. I’m still humbled and thankful for those invaluable insights and contributions in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we learn from all these companies? That NGINX solved two main issues as cloud‑native companies built web‑scale applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NGINX was an incredible frontend, an entry and exit point for all traffic flowing in and out of applications due to its high performance and concurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind this frontend was a distributed architecture made up of many services that communicated with each other using NGINX as a proxy for API traffic over HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this learning we created our vision for the company – Help customers build distributed, web‑scale applications. Later we would come to know this phenomenon as microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are two slides from our 2013 Series B pitch deck that show this vision for distributed applications working in hybrid environments between private and public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;547&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-61883&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX.jpg 1024w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX-768x410.jpg 768w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX-150x80.jpg 150w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX-640x342.jpg 640w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-application-stack-F5-NGINX-320x171.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To orient you to the diagram below: “N” is an NGINX instance, “A” is an application, “OC” is an object cache, “DB” is database, and “NS” is a NoSQL database. This clearly shows that we believed that enterprises were going to move from service‑oriented architectures (SOA) to dynamic and distributed architectures. Not only was this microservices before the industry used that term, but it was the seed of what we now call a service mesh – a specific microservices infrastructure used in some of the most advanced environments in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;547&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-61884&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX.jpg 1024w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX-768x410.jpg 768w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX-150x80.jpg 150w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX-640x342.jpg 640w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-dynamic-distributed-F5-NGINX-320x171.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go after this vision and provide web‑scale capability to enterprises, we incubated a commercial solution in AWS in 2012 and went on to launch it as NGINX Plus in late August 2013. This product, built and supported by the engineering team led by our other founder, Maxim Konovalov, has driven over 90% of our revenue to this day. We now have thousands of customers and over 150 of the Global 2000 using NGINX Plus to deliver their applications. Incredible numbers achieved in less than six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we never set out to build a company to be acquired, it’s one of the two possible outcomes for a startup, the other being an IPO. I believe F5 will be a great home for the technology, the open source project and community, and the family that have made NGINX successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where We’ll Go Next: Accelerating Our Vision with F5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With today’s news, our vision and mission don’t change. We’re still helping customers build distributed application architectures. We’re still building a platform that optimizes ingress‑egress traffic and APIs. And we’re still helping companies on their journey to microservices. What does change is our trajectory. F5 shares our mission, vision, and values. But they bring to bear a tremendous amount of additional resources and complementary technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And make no mistake about it: F5 is committed to keeping the NGINX brand and open source technology alive. Without this commitment, the deal wouldn’t have happened for either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, what excites me is the potential of combining the leaders in their two respective markets. We have complementary strengths. F5 is the industry leader in application infrastructure for network and security teams. NGINX is the industry leader in application infrastructure for developer and DevOps teams, built on our open source core. Our web and application server, microservices, and API management solutions complement the application management, application security, and infrastructure security solutions from F5. Even in the case of application delivery controllers (ADC) where there is some overlap, NGINX has created a lightweight, software‑only version that complements the F5 cloud, virtual, and physical appliance options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-61880&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2.jpg 1024w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-150x62.jpg 150w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-640x263.jpg 640w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-390x160.jpg 390w, https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog-image-expanded-opportunity-F5-NGINX-2-320x131.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe the combination opens up a larger addressable market and accelerates our collective growth. It’s a story where the sum is greater than the individual parts. Enterprises are undergoing digital transformation. Their applications are their business. Combined, F5 and NGINX provide a new, &lt;span&gt;end-to-end&lt;/span&gt; set of application offerings that bridge the divide between NetOps and DevOps. The result? Customers can spend more time focused on their apps, and less time worrying about the underlying infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re truly excited to be joining the F5 family and looking forward to the journey ahead. If you have any concerns or questions, I’d like to hear them. Leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DTrace on Windows</title>
<link>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/DTrace-on-Windows/ba-p/362902</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/DTrace-on-Windows/ba-p/362902</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Microsoft, we are always looking to engage with open source communities to produce better solutions for the community and our customers&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;. One of the more useful debugging advances that have arrived in the last decade is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;DTrace&lt;/a&gt;. DTrace of course needs no introduction: it’s a dynamic tracing framework that allows an admin or developer to get a real-time look into a system either in user or kernel mode. DTrace has a C-style high level and powerful programming language that allows you to dynamically insert trace points. Using these dynamically inserted trace points, you can filter on conditions or errors, write code to analyze lock patterns, detect deadlocks, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ETW/event-tracing-portal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ETW&lt;/a&gt; while powerful, is static and does not provide the ability to programmatically insert trace points at runtime.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of websites and resources from the community to learn about DTrace. One of the most comprehensive one is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrace.org/guide/preface.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dynamic Tracing Guide&lt;/a&gt; html book available on dtrace.org website. This ebook describes DTrace in detail and is the authoritative guide for DTrace. &lt;span&gt;We also have Windows specific examples below which will provide more info.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2016, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opendtrace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;OpenDTrace&lt;/a&gt; effort began on GitHub that &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tried to ensure a portable implementation of DTrace for different operating systems. We decided to add support for DTrace on Windows using this OpenDTrace port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created a Windows branch for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opendtrace/opendtrace/tree/windows&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;DTrace on Windows&lt;/a&gt;” under the OpenDTrace project on GitHub. All &lt;strong&gt;our changes&lt;/strong&gt; made to support DTrace on Windows are available here. Over the next few months, we plan to work with the OpenDTrace community to merge our changes. All our source code is also available at the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party &lt;a href=&quot;https://3rdpartysource.microsoft.com/download/DTrace%20on%20Windows/1.0/dtrace-1.0.zip&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; website maintained by Microsoft.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s get into how to setup and use DTrace on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites for using the feature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 insider &lt;strong&gt;build 18342&lt;/strong&gt; or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only available on &lt;strong&gt;x64&lt;/strong&gt; Windows and captures tracing info only for 64-bit processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Insider Program&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;enabled&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;configured&lt;/strong&gt; with valid Windows Insider Account
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit Settings-&amp;gt;Update &amp;amp; Security-&amp;gt;Windows Insider Program for details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCD configuration set&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;bcdedit /set dtrace on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note, you need to set the bcdedit option again, if you upgrade to a new Insider build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; and install the DTrace package from &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/D/4/BD4B95A5-0B61-4D8F-837C-F889AAD8DAA2/DTrace.amd64.msi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;download center&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This installs the user mode components, drivers and additional feature on demand packages necessary for DTrace to be functional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: Update the &lt;strong&gt;PATH environment variable&lt;/strong&gt; to include &lt;strong&gt;C:\Program Files\DTrace&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;set PATH=%PATH%;&quot;C:\Program Files\DTrace&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;strong&gt;symbol path&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new directory for caching symbols locally. Example: mkdir c:\symbols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;_NT_SYMBOL_PATH&lt;/strong&gt;=srv*C:\symbols*&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTrace automatically downloads the symbols necessary from the symbol server and caches to the local path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Setup Kernel debugger&lt;/strong&gt; connection to the target machine (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg--kernel-mode-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MSDN link&lt;/a&gt;). This is &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; required if you want to trace Kernel events using FBT or other providers.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that you will need to disable Secureboot and Bitlocker on C:, (if enabled), if you want to setup a kernel debugger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reboot&lt;/strong&gt; target machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--1069850806&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId-672959529&quot;&gt;Running DTrace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch CMD prompt in &lt;strong&gt;administrator mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get started with sample one-liners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# Syscall summary by program for 5 seconds: 
dtrace -Fn &quot;tick-5sec { exit(0);} syscall:::entry{ @num[pid,execname] = count();} &quot;
 
# Summarize timer set/cancel program for 3 seconds: 
dtrace -Fn &quot;tick-3sec { exit(0);} syscall::Nt*Timer*:entry { @[probefunc, execname, pid] = count();}&quot;
 
# Dump System Process kernel structure: (requires symbol path to be set)
dtrace -n &quot;BEGIN{print(*(struct nt`_EPROCESS *) nt`PsInitialSystemProcess);exit(0);}&quot;
 
# Tracing paths through NTFS when running notepad.exe (requires KD attach): Run below command and launch notepad.exe
dtrace -Fn &quot;fbt:ntfs::/execname==\&quot;notepad.exe\&quot;/{}&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;strong&gt;dtrace -lvn syscall:::&lt;/strong&gt; will list all the probes and their parameters available from the syscall provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are some of the providers available on Windows and what they instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;syscall&lt;/strong&gt; – NTOS system calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fbt&lt;/strong&gt; (Function Boundary Tracing) – Kernel function entry and returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pid&lt;/strong&gt; – User-mode process tracing. Like kernel-mode FBT, but also allowing the instrumentation of arbitrary function offsets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;etw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Event Tracing for Windows) – Allows probes to be defined for &lt;span&gt;ETW&lt;/span&gt; This provider helps to leverage existing operating system instrumentation in DTrace.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one addition we have done to DTrace to allow it to expose and gain all the information that Windows already provides in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ETW/event-tracing-portal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ETW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have more Windows sample scripts applicable for Windows scenarios in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://3rdpartysource.microsoft.com/download/DTrace%20on%20Windows/1.0/dtrace-MSFT.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;samples directory&lt;/a&gt; of the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--1879197432&quot;&gt;How to file feedback?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DTrace on Windows is very different from our typical features on Windows and we are going to rely on our Insider community to guide us. If you hit any problems or bugs, please use Feedback hub to let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch feedback hub by clicking this &lt;a href=&quot;windows-feedback:?contextid=1053&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Add new feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide a detailed description of the issue or suggestion.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently, we do not automatically collect any debug traces, so your verbatim feedback is crucial for understanding and reproducing the issue. Pass on any verbose logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can set &lt;strong&gt;DTRACE_DEBUG&lt;/strong&gt; environment variable to 1 to collect verbose dtrace logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId-60126408&quot;&gt;DTrace Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a little about the internals and architecture of how we supported DTrace. As mentioned, DTrace on Windows is a port of OpenDTrace &lt;span&gt;and reuses much of its user mode components and architecture&lt;/span&gt;. Users interact with DTrace through the dtrace command, which is a generic front-end to the DTrace engine. D scripts get compiled to an intermediate format (DIF) in user-space and sent to the DTrace kernel component for execution, sometimes called as the &lt;strong&gt;DIF Virtual Machine&lt;/strong&gt;. This runs in the dtrace.sys driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traceext.sys (trace extension) is a new kernel extension driver we added, which allows Windows to expose functionality that DTrace relies on to provide tracing. The Windows kernel provides callouts during stackwalk or memory accesses which are then implemented by the trace extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All APIs and functionality used by dtrace.sys are documented calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/86098i8CC63423058545DB/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;amp;px=999&quot; alt=&quot;dtrace.png&quot; title=&quot;dtrace.png&quot; li-image-url=&quot;https://gxcuf89792.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/86098i8CC63423058545DB?v=1.0&quot; li-image-display-id=&quot;'86098i8CC63423058545DB'&quot; li-message-uid=&quot;'362902'&quot; li-messages-message-image=&quot;true&quot; li-bindable=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lia-media-image&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked=&quot;true&quot; li-use-hover-links=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc-hId-1802936743&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security of Windows is key for our customers and the security model of DTrace makes it ideally suited to Windows. The DTrace guide, linked above talks about DTrace security and performance impact. It would be useful for anyone interested in this space to read that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrace.org/guide/chp-intro.html#chp-intro-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;. At a high level, DTrace uses an intermediate form which is validated for safety and runs in its own execution environment (think C# or Java). This execution environment also handles any run time errors to avoid crashing the system. In addition, the cost of having a probe is minimal and should not visibly affect the system performance unless you enable too many probes in performance sensitive paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DTrace on Windows also leverages the Windows security model in useful ways to enhance its security for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To connect to the DTrace trace engine, your account needs to be part of the &lt;strong&gt;admin&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;LocalSystem&lt;/strong&gt; group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events originating from kernel mode (FBT, syscalls with ‘kernel’ previous mode, etc.), are only traceable if &lt;strong&gt;Kernel debugger&lt;/strong&gt; is attached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To read kernel-mode memory (probe parameters for kernel-mode originated events, kernel-mode global variables, etc.), the following must be true:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;DTrace session security context has either TCB or LoadDriver privilege enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure Boot is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To trace a user-mode process, the user needs to have:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debug privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEBUG access to the target process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-hId--945733723&quot;&gt;Script signing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have also updated DTrace on Windows to support signing of d scripts. We follow the same model as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; to support signing of scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a system wide DTrace script signing policy knob which controls whether to check for signing or not for DTrace scripts. This policy knob is controlled by the Registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, we do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; check for signature on DTrace scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following registry keys to enforce policy at machine or user level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User Scope: &lt;strong&gt;HKCU\Software\OpenDTrace\Dtrace, ExecutionPolicy, REG_SZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Scope: &lt;strong&gt;HKLM\Software\OpenDTrace\Dtrace, ExecutionPolicy, REG_SZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Values&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DTrace policy take the following values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Bypass&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;: do not perform signature checks. This is the default policy. Only set the registry key if you want to deviate from this policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Unrestricted&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;: Do not perform checks on local files, allow user's consent to use unsigned remote files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;RemoteSigned&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;: Do not perform checks on local files, requires a valid and trusted signature for remote files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;AllSigned&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;: Require valid and trusted signature for all files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Restricted&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;: Script file must be installed as a system component and have a signature from the trusted source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also set policy by defining the environment variable &lt;strong&gt;DTRACE_EXECUTION_POLICY&lt;/strong&gt; to the required value.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to release the first version of DTrace on Windows. We look forward to feedback from the Windows Insider community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

<title>OpenAI LP</title>
<link>https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;js-excerpt&quot; readability=&quot;8.6684210526316&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've created OpenAI LP, a new &quot;capped-profit&quot; company that allows us to rapidly increase our investments in compute and talent while including checks and balances to actualize our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/charter/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, primarily by attempting to build safe AGI and share the benefits with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/&quot;&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;firsthand&lt;/a&gt; that the most dramatic AI systems use the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/&quot;&gt;computational power&lt;/a&gt; in addition to algorithmic innovations, and decided to scale much faster than we’d planned when starting OpenAI. We’ll need to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large-scale cloud compute, attracting and retaining talented people, and building AI supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to increase our ability to raise capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we know of strikes the right balance. Our solution is to create OpenAI LP as a hybrid of a for-profit and nonprofit—which we are calling a &quot;capped-profit&quot; company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea of OpenAI LP is that investors and employees can get a capped return if we succeed at our mission, which allows us to raise investment capital and attract employees with startup-like equity. But any returns beyond that amount—and if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we’d owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP—are owned by the original OpenAI Nonprofit entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://openai.com/content/images/2019/03/lp-logo-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lp-logo-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward (in this post and elsewhere), “OpenAI” refers to OpenAI LP (which now employs most of our staff), and the original entity is referred to as “OpenAI Nonprofit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;themissioncomesfirst&quot;&gt;The mission comes first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve designed OpenAI LP to put our overall mission—ensuring the creation and adoption of safe and beneficial AGI—ahead of generating returns for investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission comes first even with respect to OpenAI LP’s structure. While we are hopeful that what we describe below will work until our mission is complete, we may update our implementation as the world changes. Regardless of how the world evolves, we are committed—legally and personally—to our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI LP’s primary fiduciary obligation is to advance the aims of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-charter/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Charter&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is controlled by OpenAI Nonprofit’s board. All investors and employees sign agreements that OpenAI LP’s obligation to the Charter always comes first, even at the expense of some or all of their financial stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://openai.com/content/images/2019/03/purple-notice.svg&quot; alt=&quot;purple-notice&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our employee and investor paperwork start with big purple boxes like this. The general partner refers to OpenAI Nonprofit (whose legal name is “OpenAI Inc”); limited partners refers to investors and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a minority of board members are allowed to hold financial stakes in the partnership at one time. Furthermore, only board members without such stakes can vote on decisions where the interests of limited partners and OpenAI Nonprofit’s mission may conflict—including any decisions about making payouts to investors and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scrim&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://openai.com/content/images/2019/03/corporate-structure.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another provision from our paperwork specifies that OpenAI Nonprofit retains control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, economic returns for investors and employees are capped (with the cap negotiated in advance on a per-limited partner basis). Any excess returns go to OpenAI Nonprofit. Our goal is to ensure that most of the value (monetary or otherwise) we create if successful benefits everyone, so we think this is an important first step. Returns for our first round of investors are capped at 100x their investment (commensurate with the risks in front of us), and we expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds as we make further progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatopenaidoes&quot;&gt;What OpenAI does&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our day-to-day work is not changing. Today, we believe we can build the most value by focusing exclusively on developing new AI technologies, not commercial products. Our structure gives us flexibility for how to create a return in the long term, but we hope to figure that out only once we’ve created safe AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI LP currently employs around 100 people organized into three main areas: capabilities (advancing what AI systems can do), safety (ensuring those systems are aligned with human values), and policy (ensuring appropriate governance for such systems). OpenAI Nonprofit governs OpenAI LP, runs educational programs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars/&quot;&gt;Scholars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-fellows-interns-2019/&quot;&gt;Fellows&lt;/a&gt;, and hosts policy initiatives. OpenAI LP is continuing (at increased pace and scale) the development roadmap started at OpenAI Nonprofit, which has yielded breakthroughs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/&quot;&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/&quot;&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited by the potential for AGI to help solve planetary-scale problems in areas where humanity is failing and there is no obvious solution today. However, we are also concerned about AGI’s potential to cause rapid change, whether through machines pursuing goals misspecified by their operator, malicious humans subverting deployed systems, or an out-of-control economy that grows without resulting in improvements to human lives. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-charter/#race&quot;&gt;described in our Charter&lt;/a&gt;, we are willing to merge with a value-aligned organization (even if it means reduced or zero payouts to investors) to avoid a competitive race which would make it hard to prioritize safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whosinvolved&quot;&gt;Who's involved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenAI Nonprofit’s board consists of OpenAI LP employees Greg Brockman (Chairman &amp;amp; CTO), Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist), and Sam Altman (CEO), and non-employees Adam D’Angelo, Holden Karnofsky, Reid Hoffman, Sue Yoon, and Tasha McCauley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon Musk left the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-supporters/&quot;&gt;board of OpenAI Nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; in February 2018 and is not formally involved with OpenAI LP. We are thankful for all his past help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our investors include Reid Hoffman's charitable foundation and Khosla Ventures, among others. We feel lucky to have mission-aligned, impact-focused, helpful investors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are traveling a hard and uncertain path, but we have designed our structure to help us positively affect the world should we succeed in creating AGI—which we think will have as broad impact as the computer itself and improve healthcare, education, scientific research, and many aspects of people's lives. If you’d like to help us make this mission a reality, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; :)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sway 1.0</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2019/03/11/Sway-1.0-released.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2019/03/11/Sway-1.0-released.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;1,315 days after I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://swaywm.org&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt; project, it’s finally time for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/sway/releases/tag/1.0&quot;&gt;sway 1.0&lt;/a&gt;! I had no idea at the time how much work I was in for, or how many talented people would join and support the project with me. In order to complete this project, we have had to rewrite the entire Linux desktop nearly from scratch. Nearly 300 people worked together, together writing over 9,000 commits and almost 100,000 lines of code, to bring you this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;Sway is an i3-compatible Wayland desktop for Linux and FreeBSD&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0 is the first stable release of sway and represents a consistent, flexible, and powerful desktop environment for Linux and FreeBSD. We hope you’ll enjoy it! If the last sway release you used was 0.15 or earlier, you’re in for a shock. 0.15 was a buggy, frustrating desktop to use, but sway 1.0 has been completely overhauled and represents a much more capable desktop. It’s almost impossible to summarize all of the changes which makes 1.0 great. Sway 1.0 adds a huge variety of features which were sorely missed on 0.x, improves performance in every respect, offers a more faithful implementation of Wayland, and exists as a positive political force in the Wayland ecosystem pushing for standardization and cooperation among Wayland projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning the future of sway, we realized that the Wayland ecosystem was sorely in need of a stable &amp;amp; flexible common base library to encapsulate all of the difficult and complex facets of building a desktop. To this end, I decided we would build &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots&quot;&gt;wlroots&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a smashing success. This project has become very important to the Linux desktop ecosystem, and the benefits we reap from it have been shared with the community at large. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/wiki/Projects-which-use-wlroots&quot;&gt;Dozens of projects&lt;/a&gt; are using it today, and soon you’ll find it underneath most Linux desktops, on your phone, in your VR environment, and more. Its influence extends beyond its borders as well, as we develop and push for standards throughout Wayland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this work we have also helped to build a broader ecosystem of tools built on interoperable standards which you may find useful in your new sway 1.0 desktop. Here are a few of my favorites - each of which is compatible with many Wayland compositors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without the support of sway’s and wlroots’ talented contributors. Hundreds of people worked together on this. I’d like to give special thanks to our core contributors: Brian Ashworth, Ian Fan, Ryan Dwyer, Scott Anderson, and Simon Ser. Thanks are also in order for those who have helped wlroots fit into the broader ecosystem - thanks to Purism for their help on wlroots, KDE &amp;amp; Canonical for their help on protocol standardization. I also owe thanks to all of the other projects which use wlroots, particularly including Way Cooler, Wayfire, and Waymonad, who all have made substantial contributions to wlroots in their pursit of the best Wayland desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also of course like to thank all of the users who have donated to support my work, which I now do full-time, which has had and I hope will continue to have a positive impact on the project and those around it. Please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/donate&quot;&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt; to support the future of sway &amp;amp; wlroots if you haven’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though sway today is already stable and powerful, we’re not done yet. We plan to continue improving performance &amp;amp; stability, adding useful desktop features, taking advantage of better hardware, and bringing sway to more users. Here’s some of what we have planned for future releases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better Wayland-native tools for internationalized input methods like CJK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better accessibility tools including improved screen reader support, high-contrast mode, a magnifying glass tool, and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with xdg-portal &amp;amp; pipewire for interoperable screen capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved touch screen support for use on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/&quot;&gt;Librem 5&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://postmarketos.org/&quot;&gt;postmarketOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better support for drawing tablets and additional hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sandboxing and security features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all sway features, we intend to have the best-in-class implementations of these features and set the bar as high as we can for everyone else. We’re looking forward to your continued support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;Have a comment on one of my posts? Start a discussion in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox&quot;&gt;public inbox&lt;/a&gt; by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:~sircmpwn/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht?Subject=Re%3A%20Announcing%20the%20release%20of%20sway%201.0&quot;&gt;~sircmpwn/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/lists.sr.ht/etiquette.md&quot;&gt;mailing list etiquette&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://glench.com&quot;&gt;Glen Chiacchieri&lt;/a&gt; / January 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tell people that I have a background in engineering, programming, and user interface research but am now becoming a licensed psychotherapist, they're usually surprised. They often ask me how that transition happened. It was a difficult one, and I thought I'd write about it here on my website. I hope that this story may help others in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I moved from Boston to San Francisco in order to work at a research lab called CDG (the precursor to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dynamicland.org&quot;&gt;Dynamicland&lt;/a&gt;). This was basically my dream job. I got paid a good salary to work on whatever I wanted with one of my idols, a computer visionary named &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com&quot;&gt;Bret Victor&lt;/a&gt;. I got to use my skills in engineering, programming, and user interface design to invent innovative media that may become commonplace decades in the future. I had no deadlines, no boss, and no expectations about what I would produce. It was up to me to work on what I thought was worthwhile. But what's worthwhile to work on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I created things in the style of Bret's work before 2012 — humanistic media to augment intellect and creativity. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionaryofnumbers.com&quot;&gt;Dictionary of Numbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://glench.com/LegibleMathematics/&quot;&gt;Legible Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://glench.com/EyesOnThePrize/&quot;&gt;Eyes on the Prize&lt;/a&gt; came from. I also learned everything I could about how people learn, user interface design theory, the history of computation, and media theory — I read over 50 books on these subjects in one year! I basically gave myself a graduate education in computational media studies. I used what I learned in these studies to make dozens and dozens of experimental computer user interfaces, trying to invent prototypes that help people learn and understand things in ways that are fundamentally impossible without dynamic media. I worked really hard every day all day on this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about two years of this, I really began to struggle choosing projects to work on. I would start a project impulsively and then abandon it a day later in frustration. I tried prioritizing my work, focusing on the things I felt the most passionately about, but when I tried to work on the projects at the top of this list I couldn't summon any energy. Yet I spent hours and hours thinking obsessively about the ultimate point of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started asking myself questions like — &quot;Even if the projects I'm doing succeeded beyond my wildest expectations, how would it affect people? Whose lives would be improved and how would they be improved?&quot; I tried to be really honest and concrete, thinking of specific people and specific ways their lives would be positively affected. I studied the way other technological inventions contributed or detracted from people's happiness. I started reading about subjects other than computer media and collected articles that seemed to contribute to human happiness in a way that felt meaningful to me. One of my colleagues, a compassionate, intelligent, and warm friend named Michael, discussed these topics endlessly with me, helping me explore my ideas and feelings and offering his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, with Michael's help, I began to realize that my work wouldn't help people be happier in ways that felt meaningful to me. Something deep in my soul seemed completely dissatisfied. Slowly, depression crept in and took root. I had trouble going to sleep and getting out of bed. I would often go into work really late. I remember when I went to parties and people asked me what I did, I felt ashamed and confused trying to describe my job. I started getting sick every month. At one point I was having serious existential crises at least once a week. What should I work on? What helps people be happy? What am I doing here? These questions ravaged me for months. I felt more and more lost, anxious, and frustrated. I showed up less and less to work until finally I couldn't take it anymore — I quit. I left what I thought was my dream job and moved back to Boston in 2016 to regroup and explore other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back from a place of greater perspective, I'd say that having freedom from external meaning-making systems caused me to look inward. With no one telling me what to work on I had to decide for myself what was meaningful in this life. Because of how seriously I took my work, this process was very difficult for me. By questioning my value system so deeply, the primary source of meaning in my life — my work — crumbled into meaninglessness. What would I do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know, but I had some clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I left my job, I began to treat my life like a science experiment, trying lots of things, reading lots of things, discussing lots of things. I intently observed my reactions to these things in an empirical way, seeing what resonated and what didn't in order discover a deeper pattern, if there was one. I tried to keep as open a mind as I could, not judging any of my reactions but just noting them and piecing them together to see what I could learn about myself. Out of this process, some major clues began emerging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first clue was at Burning Man in 2015. As a kind of gag, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://glench.com/EmojiTokens/&quot;&gt;Emoji Tokens&lt;/a&gt; I made to tell people's fortunes. I would ask them what they wanted to know about their future and wouldn't accept their response until it felt like it reached a certain level of depth, something that felt important to them. Once we arrived at something that felt acceptable, I would pick random emoji out of the bag and we would tell their fortune together based on those emoji. I ended up in several deep conversations with people because of this. We had conversations about where they wanted to live, who they wanted to be in relationship with, what kind of work they wanted to be doing — basically what they wanted from this life. I really liked having these conversations, but at the time it just struck me as a fun diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apparent love of deep conversations became clearer with my second clue. A couple months after I moved back to Boston in 2016, I spent a week in New York City doing a residency at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://recurse.com&quot;&gt;The Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;, a self-directed programmer's retreat. Programmers from all walks of life attend the program for free for 6 or 12-week &quot;batches&quot;, working on their own personal projects or collaborating with other programmers in the retreat. Throughout my previous work I was interested in how people learn, and the Recurse Center had an innovative model with a great reputation so I wanted to see it. As a resident there, I had a lot of freedom in what I could spend my time doing, so I decided to spend my time talking one-on-one with people, trying to understand what they were doing there, what they wanted to work on, and how I could help them. In these conversations I practiced a skill I called &quot;deep listening&quot; and it was amazing — I had over 30 hour-long conversations with people about all kinds of topics. Several of these conversations resulted in either me or the other person crying from how meaningful our meeting was. I describe these conversations in more detail in an article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://glench.com/DeepListeningAtTheRecurseCenter/&quot;&gt;Deep Listening at the Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;. Even as it was happening I recognized how special it felt to be having these conversations. This was definitely a strong indication that connecting with people about deep things in their lives felt important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third clue: While I was still in California I had tried a type of massage that helps people access emotions held in their bodies called the Rosen Method. Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rosen-Method-Bodywork-Accessing-Unconscious/dp/1556434189&quot;&gt;one of the books&lt;/a&gt; written by the method's originator, I found myself tearing up whenever the author described the ways her clients had transformed their lives. The fact that I had so much emotion around this theme of transformation definitely felt meaningful to me, but I didn't know why. I got some sessions from a Rosen Method practitioner, and then, after I quit my job, ended up taking two week-long intensive trainings in the method to practice giving Rosen massages to other people. I grew a lot in these trainings. I remember being particularly struck by the way that the trainers talked about and practiced empathic presence and empathic listening, both with their ears and with their hands. However, by the end of the second training I became somewhat disillusioned with the Rosen Method. It had a lot of elements I felt were important — empathic presence, focus on the body, gentleness, an emphasis on transformation — but other things felt disatisfying to me. These elements were my third clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fourth clue came in an article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment&quot;&gt;The Trip Treatment&lt;/a&gt; I had read while I was still at my research job. In this article, author Michael Pollan discusses new scientific research happening with psychedelics. What caught my eye in particular was this passage about participant experiences of clinically-administered psilocybin, the mind-altering chemical in &quot;magic&quot; mushrooms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants ranked [their psychedelic] experiences as among the most meaningful in their lives, comparable to the birth of a child or the death of a parent. Two-thirds of the participants rated the psilocybin session among the top five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives; a third ranked it at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, people were having some of the top experiences &lt;em&gt;of their lives&lt;/em&gt; by taking psychedelics? What were these things? I began to read more about them over the next year, especially in the books by the psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanislavgrof.com/page-6/&quot;&gt;Stanislav Grof&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed that with the right environment and mindset, these substances could be used to bring about non-ordinary states of consciousness that can facilitate transformative spiritual change and healing in people's lives. I decided to try them out. In several sessions over months I took LSD alone in my house with an eyeshade on listening to music. I went deep inside and had several important insights as well as many challenging emotional experiences. One session helped me realize how miserable I was at my job in California, another had me evaluating my relationship with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was one session in particular — on April 20, 2017 — where all the clues came together most powerfully. At the tail end of a psychedelic journey that I number among the most significant spiritual events of my life, I asked myself squarely: what should I do with my life? With my recent experiences in deep conversations, training in the Rosen Method, and using psychedelics for transformative change, the answer came back simply, clearly, and joyfully: I should become a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was no longer feeling the effects of the drug I considered the idea more thoroughly. Over the next few months the idea of becoming a therapist stayed with me and grew. I decided to act. I signed up for a year-long training in an experiential mindfulness-based therapy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakomi&quot;&gt;the Hakomi Method&lt;/a&gt; that Michael had introduced me to at the end of 2016. Hakomi is a therapy modality that incorporates mindfulness and body awareness with traditional talk therapy to powerful effect. When I began training in this method, I found it nourishing in ways that I wasn't even aware I needed, but had been wanting for a long time — it felt like home. I discovered that my emotions, rather than being childish, irrational, or random, had a deep logic and wisdom to them that would help me live more fully and freely if I listened to them in the right way. Shortly after beginning my Hakomi training, I applied and was accepted to the professional mental health counseling masters program at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I'm studying and training through 2020 to get my licensure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's more or less how I became a therapist. I grew deeply disillusioned with my technical work, determining that it wouldn't significantly contribute to people's happiness in ways that felt satisfying to me, and I set out to explore new work, work that would directly contribute to people's happiness and well-being. In the course of this process, I discovered a deeply-held desire in myself to help people grow and transform their lives, something I had never consciously cared about in my life before. I also discovered that to help other people transform I first had to grow and transform myself. To this end, during the period of searching described above I also developed a dedicated spiritual practice of Tibetan Buddhist meditation, studying under &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointingoutway.org&quot;&gt;Dr. Daniel Brown&lt;/a&gt;. This practice supported me immensely throughout this difficult time, and I'm extremely grateful to Dan for his tireless and compassionate teaching, and to Michael, for introducing me to the benefits of meditation, psychedelics, and bodywork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the telling of this story, I realize it may sound like it was a clear and direct path toward more meaningful work. I assure you, it was not. I tried many, many things I didn't mention in the story and often felt lost, frustrated, anxious, and depressed. I also regularly had no idea what I was doing or if my scrambled searching would lead anywhere at all — the process was very non-linear, like picking a small collection of stars from the vast night sky and trying to draw lines connecting them. And while I can't say I don't ever feel lost, frustrated, anxious, or depressed anymore, I feel them much less often and have a greater capacity to deal with them when they do arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to say that as I've followed my new line of work I've found deeper and deeper satisfaction. I no longer struggle with the meaning of my work, and I find I have much more energy to dedicate to its pursuit. My work in therapy feels deeply aligned with who I am and who I want to be. I hope to continue to advance my therapeutic skills and grow myself in service of the well-being of all my future clients as well as all sentient beings. This is my wish from the bottom of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wipe and reinstall a running Linux system via SSH (2017)</title>
<link>https://github.com/marcan/takeover.sh</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/marcan/takeover.sh</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A script to completely take over a running Linux system remotely, allowing you to log into an in-memory rescue environment, unmount the original root filesystem, and do anything you want, all without rebooting. Replace one distro with another without touching a physical console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is experimental. Do not use this script if you don't understand exactly how it works. Do not use this script on any system you care about. Do not use this script on any system you expect to be up. Do not run this script unless you can afford to get physical access to fix a botched takeover. If anything goes wrong, your system will most likely panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this script will not (itself) make any permanent changes to your existing root filesystem (assuming you run it from a tmpfs), so as long as you can remotely reboot your box using an out-of-band mechanism, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be OK. But don't blame me if it eats your dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script does not have any provisions for exiting &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the new environment back into something sane. You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to reboot when you're done. If you get anything wrong, your machine won't boot. Tough luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a guide for newbies. I'm deliberately not giving you commands you can copy and paste. If you can't figure out what to do exactly without handholding, this script is not for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script is designed for init systems that support the &lt;code&gt;telinit u&lt;/code&gt; command to reload the init binary. This includes sysvinit and systemd. If your init system works a different way, you will have to adapt it, or this might not work at all. You're on your own here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always test this in a VM first. You can grab a tarball of your live root filesystem, extract it into a VM image, get your VM up and running (boot loader setup is left as an exercise for the reader), then try the process there and see if it works. Hint: &lt;code&gt;mount --bind / /mnt&lt;/code&gt; will get you a view of your root filesystem on &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt; without any other filesystems that are mounted on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to decide on what rescue environment you want. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SystemRescueCD&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with many useful tools (you have to loopmount the ISO and then use &lt;code&gt;unsquashfs&lt;/code&gt;). Obviously, whatever you pick has to fit into free RAM, with room to spare. If your chosen rescue environment has &lt;code&gt;/lib/modules&lt;/code&gt;, you may want to get rid of it to save space, as its kernel modules won't be useful on the host kernel anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a directory &lt;code&gt;/takeover&lt;/code&gt; on your target system and mount a tmpfs on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract your rescue environment there. Make sure it works by chrooting into it and running a few commands. Make sure you do not bork filesystem permissions. Exit the chroot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab a recent copy of &lt;code&gt;busybox&lt;/code&gt; (statically linked) and put it in &lt;code&gt;/takeover/busybox&lt;/code&gt;. You can find binaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.26.2-defconfig-multiarch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure it works by trying something like &lt;code&gt;/takeover/busybox sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents of this repository into &lt;code&gt;/takeover&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile &lt;code&gt;fakeinit.c&lt;/code&gt;. It must be compiled such that it works inside the takeover environment. If your rescue environment has &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;, you can just compile it inside the chroot: &lt;code&gt;chroot /takeover gcc /fakeinit.c -o /fakeinit&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, you might want to statically link it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut down as many services as you can on your host. &lt;code&gt;takeover.sh&lt;/code&gt; will by default set up an SSHd listening on port 80, though you may edit this in the script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;sh /takeover/takeover.sh&lt;/code&gt; and follow the prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everything worked, congratulations! You may now use your new SSH session to kill any remaining old daemons (&lt;code&gt;kill -9&lt;/code&gt; is recommended to make sure they don't try to do anything silly during shutdown), and then unmount all filesystems under &lt;code&gt;/old_root&lt;/code&gt;, including &lt;code&gt;/old_root&lt;/code&gt; itself. You may want to first copy &lt;code&gt;/old_root/lib/modules&lt;/code&gt; into your new tmpfs in case you need any old kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are now running entirely from RAM and should be able to do as you please. Note that you may still have to clean up LVM volumes (&lt;code&gt;dmsetup&lt;/code&gt; is your friend) and similar before you can safely repartition your disk and install Gentoo Linux, which is of course the whole reason you're doing this crazy thing to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're done, unmount all filesystems, &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;reboot -f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;echo b &amp;gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger&lt;/code&gt; and cross your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/226872/how-to-shrink-root-filesystem-without-booting-a-livecd/227318#227318&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this StackExchange answer&lt;/a&gt; which details how to manually perform a similar process, but using a subset of the existing root filesystem instead of a rescue filesystem. This allows you to keep (a new copy of) the existing init system running, as well as essential daemons, and then go back to the original root filesystem once you're done. This is a more useful version if, for example, you want to resize the original root filesystem or re-configure disk partitions, but not actually install a different distro, and you want to avoid rebooting at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;takeover.sh&lt;/code&gt; could be extended to support re-execing a new init once you're done. This could be used to switch to a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; distro entirely without rebooting, as long as you're happy using the old kernel. If you're interested, pull requests welcome :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The internet consists of tiny bits of code that move around the world, traveling along wires as thin as a strand of hair strung across the ocean floor. The data zips from New York to Sydney, from Hong Kong to London, in the time it takes you to read this word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-pattern=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/cable-in-hand-{{size}}.jpg&quot; data-pattern-retina=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/cable-in-hand-{{size}}_x2.jpg&quot; data-widths=&quot;[320,480,640,900,1050,1254,2000]&quot; data-ratio=&quot;0.7139457401237506&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Nearly 750,000 miles of cable already connect the continents to support our insatiable demand for communication and entertainment. Companies have typically pooled their resources to collaborate on undersea cable projects, like a freeway for them all to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But now Google is going its own way, in a first-of-its-kind project connecting the United States to Chile, home to the company’s largest data center in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“People think that data is in the cloud, but it’s not,” said Jayne Stowell, who oversees construction of Google’s undersea cable projects. “It’s in the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Getting it there is an exacting and time-intensive process. A 456-foot ship named Durable will eventually deliver the cable to sea. But first, the cable is assembled inside a sprawling factory a few hundred yards away, in Newington, N.H. The factory, owned by the company SubCom, is filled with specialized machinery used to maintain tension in the wire and encase it in protective skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-pattern=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/spool-{{size}}.jpg&quot; data-pattern-retina=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/spool-{{size}}_x2.jpg&quot; data-widths=&quot;[320,480,640,900,1050,1254,2000]&quot; data-ratio=&quot;0.6666666666666666&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The cables begin as a cluster of strands of tiny threads of glass fibers. Lasers propel data down the threads at nearly the speed of light, using fiber-optic technology. After reaching land and connecting with an existing network, the data needed to read an email or open a web page makes its way onto a person’s device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;While most of us now largely experience the internet through Wi-Fi and phone data plans, those systems eventually link up with physical cables that swiftly carry the information across continents or across oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In the manufacturing process, the cables move through high-speed mills the size of jet engines, wrapping the wire in a copper casing that carries electricity across the line to keep the data moving. Depending on where the cable will be located, plastic, steel and tar are added later to help it withstand unpredictable ocean environments. When finished, the cables will end up the size of a thick garden hose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-pattern=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/men-at-track-{{size}}.jpg&quot; data-pattern-retina=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/men-at-track-{{size}}_x2.jpg&quot; data-widths=&quot;[320,480,640,900,1050,1254,2000]&quot; data-ratio=&quot;0.6670023014959724&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;A year of planning goes into charting a cable route that avoids underwater hazards, but the cables still have to withstand heavy currents, rock slides, earthquakes and interference from fishing trawlers. Each cable is expected to last up to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;A conveyor that staff members call “the Cable Highway” moves the cable directly into Durable, docked in the Piscataqua River. The ship will carry over 4,000 miles of cable weighing about 3,500 metric tons when fully loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Inside the ship, workers spool the cable into cavernous tanks. One person walks the cable swiftly in a circle, as if laying out a massive garden hose, while others lie down to hold it in place to ensure it doesn’t snag or knot. Even with teams working around the clock, it takes about four weeks before the ship is loaded up with enough cable to hit the open sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The first trans-Atlantic cable was completed in 1858 to connect the United States and Britain. Queen Victoria commemorated the occasion with a message to President James Buchanan that took &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0516.html&quot;&gt;16 hours to transmit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;While new wireless and satellite technologies have been invented in the decades since, cables remain the fastest, most efficient and least expensive way to send information across the ocean. And it is still far from cheap: Google would not disclose the cost of its project to Chile, but experts say subsea projects cost up to $350 million, depending on the length of the cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In the modern era, telecommunications companies laid most of the cable, but over the past decade American tech giants started taking more control. Google has backed at least 14 cables globally. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have invested in others, connecting data centers in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Africa, according to TeleGeography, a research firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Countries view the undersea cables as critical infrastructure and the projects have been flash points in geopolitical disputes. Last year, Australia stepped in to block the Chinese technology giant Huawei from building a cable connecting Australia to the Solomon Islands, for fear it would give the Chinese government an entry point into its networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Yann Durieux, a ship captain, said one of his most important responsibilities was keeping morale up among his crew during the weeks at sea. Building the infrastructure of our digital world is a labor-intensive job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;With 53 bedrooms and 60 bathrooms, the Durable can hold up to 80 crew members. The team splits into two 12-hour shifts. Signs warn to be quiet in the hallways because somebody is always sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The ship will carry enough supplies to last at least 60 days: roughly 200 loaves of bread, 100 gallons of milk, 500 cartons of a dozen eggs, 800 pounds of beef, 1,200 pounds of chicken and 1,800 pounds of rice. There’s also 300 rolls of paper towels, 500 rolls of toilet paper, 700 bars of soap and almost 600 pounds of laundry detergent. No alcohol is allowed on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-pattern=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/ship-tank-{{size}}.jpg&quot; data-pattern-retina=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/02/15/undersea-cables/assets/images/ship-tank-{{size}}_x2.jpg&quot; data-widths=&quot;[320,480,640,900,1050,1254,2000]&quot; data-ratio=&quot;0.6774909797391063&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“I still get seasick,” said Walt Oswald, a technician who has been laying cables on ships for 20 years. He sticks a small patch behind his ear to hold back the nausea. “It’s not for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Poor weather is inevitable. Swells reach up to 20 feet, occasionally requiring the ship captain to order the subsea cable to be cut so the ship can seek safer waters. When conditions improve, the ship returns, retrieving the cut cable that has been left attached to a floating buoy, then splicing it back together before continuing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Work on board is slow and plodding. The ship, at sea for months at a time, moves about six miles per hour, as the cables are pulled from the giant basins out through openings at the back of the ship. Closer to shore, where there’s more risk of damage, an underwater plow is used to bury the cable in the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The Durable crew doesn’t expect the work to slow down anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;After the Latin America project, Google plans to build a new cable running from Virginia to France, set to be done by 2020. The company has 13 data centers open around the world, with eight more under construction — all needed to power the trillions of Google searches made each year and the more than 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube each minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“It really is management of a very complex multidimensional chess board,” said Ms. Stowell of Google, who wears an undersea cable as a necklace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Demand for undersea cables will only grow as more businesses rely on cloud computing services. And technology expected around the corner, like more powerful artificial intelligence and driverless cars, will all require fast data speeds as well. Areas that didn’t have internet are now getting access, with the United Nations reporting that for the first time more than half the global population is now online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“This is a huge part of the infrastructure that’s making that happen,” said Debbie Brask, the vice president at SubCom, who is managing the Google project. “All of that data is going in the undersea cables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
