<title>Ex-Mozilla CTO: I was grilled for three hours at US airport by border cops</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_border_patrol_search_demand_mozilla_cto/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_border_patrol_search_demand_mozilla_cto/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Former Mozilla CTO Andreas Gal says he was interrogated for three hours by America's border cops after arriving at San Francisco airport – because he refused to unlock his work laptop and phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal, now employed by Apple, today &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@andreasgal/no-one-should-have-to-travel-in-fear-b2bff4c460e5&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; he was detained and grilled on November 29 after landing in California following a trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had attempted to pass through US customs via a Global Entry electronic kiosk. He wasn't expecting a problem, since the Hungarian-born techie is now an American citizen, but it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;On this trip, the kiosk directed me to a Customs and Border Patrol agent who kept my passport and sent me to secondary inspection,&quot; Gal said. &quot;There I quickly found myself surrounded by three armed agents wearing bullet proof vests. They started to question me aggressively regarding my trip, my current employment, and my past work for Mozilla, a non-profit organization dedicated to open technology and online privacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal said the g-men were rather interested in his time at Firefox-maker Mozilla, and of his recent trip to Canada. They also went through his wallet and luggage, and this led to a request by the agents for Gal to unlock his Apple-issued iPhone XS and MacBook Pro so they could search it, it is claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the devices were emblazoned with big red stickers reading &quot;PROPERTY OF APPLE. PROPRIETARY,&quot; and he had signed confidentially agreements with Cupertino, Gal said he asked for permission to call his bosses and/or a lawyer to see if he would get into trouble by handing over access. When this request was repeatedly refused, we're told, he clammed up, taking the Fifth, and citing constitutional rights against unwarranted searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irked by Gal's refusal, it is claimed, the border agents told him he had no constitutional nor any legal protections, and threatened him with criminal charges should he not concede to the search. He said he was eventually allowed to leave with his belongings, the devices still locked, and no charges were pressed. Gal said the agents did take away his Global Entry pass, which allows express entry through customs, as punishment for not complying with their demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;How random is random?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal believes the ordeal was not a random search gone awry, but rather a targeted attempt by the government to send a message. Certainly more and more security researchers report being grilled by US border patrol, if they can even &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/05/rsa_cofounder_us_visa_row/&quot;&gt;get a visa&lt;/a&gt; to enter the country, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My past work on encryption and online privacy is well documented, and so is my disapproval of the Trump administration and my history of significant campaign contributions to Democratic candidates,&quot; Gal noted. &quot;I wonder whether these CBP [Customs and Border Patrol] programs led to me being targeted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/07/14/tsa_gloves.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;TSA gloves&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Customs officials will at least need 'reasonable suspicion' to slurp device contents&quot;&gt;US border cops told to stop copying people's files just for the hell of it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/05/us_customs_copying_files/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Gal has enlisted the help of the ACLU to probe into the brouhaha, and determine whether his civil rights were violated. The civil-liberties watchdog has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclunc.org/docs/ACLU-NC_2019-03-28_Letter_re._Electronic_Device_Search_SFO.pdf&quot;&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] with the Department of Homeland security to determine whether the search violated the US Constitution and demand an investigation of whether the CBP's entry policies are illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CBP's baseless detention and intrusive interrogation of Andreas Gal and the attempted search of his devices violated his Fourth Amendment rights,&quot; ACLU Northern California senior counsel William Freeman said of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Furthermore, CBP’s policies lack protections for First Amendment rights by allowing interrogation and device searches that may be based on a traveler’s political beliefs, activism, nation of origin, or identity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the border patrol told us: &quot;As a matter of policy, CBP can’t comment on pending litigation.&quot; ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A16Z is registering as a financial advisor, renouncing its status as a VC</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-is-blowing-up-the-venture-capital-model-again/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-is-blowing-up-the-venture-capital-model-again/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;merging from the financial crisis in 2009, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz laid out their campaign to take on Silicon Valley. The pitch deck for their first venture capital fund that year promised to find a new generation of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=8011518&amp;amp;page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;megalomaniacal&lt;/a&gt;” founders—ambitious, assertive, singularly focused—who would, in the mold of CEO Steve Jobs, use technology to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macworld.com/article/1162827/steve-jobs-making-a-dent-in-the-universe.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;put a dent in the universe.&lt;/a&gt;” In getting behind the likes of Facebook and Twitter, with a war chest that swelled into the billions, they proceeded to do exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perched on a couch in his office at Andreessen Horowitz’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Andreessen, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/08/09/remembering-netscape/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Netscape browser&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent company IPO were touchstone moments of the digital age, understands that the original word choice doesn’t land so well in 2019. His new take: “The 21st century is the century of disagreeableness,” he says, sitting down with &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; for his first extended interview in two years. In an era of hyper-connectivity, social media and information overload, he says, those “disagreeables” will challenge the status quo and create billion-dollar companies. Ego is out, anger—or dissidence, at least—is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s an equally unpleasant prospect, consider Andreessen, who’s 47, the perfect messenger. From showy check-writing to weaponizing his popular blog and (before Trump) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pmarca?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; to hiring an army of operational experts in a field built on low-key partnerships, he’s one of Silicon Valley’s poster boys for upending the rules. And it’s worked: In one decade, Andreessen Horowitz joined the elite VC gatekeepers of Silicon Valley while generating $10 billion-plus in estimated profits, at least on paper, to its investors. Over the next year or so, expect no less than five of its unicorns—Airbnb, Lyft, PagerDuty, Pinterest and Slack—to go public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the number one form of differentiation in any industry? Being number one,” lectures Andreessen, who—at 6-foot-5 with a shaved dome that his wife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiraforbes/2012/09/18/with-great-wealth-comes-great-responsibility/#15dde6a13097&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt; Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, has been known to lovingly call “my egg”—carries himself with a brio to match his words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taying number one, however, is even harder than getting there. Optimism that technology will transform the world for the better has soured with each successive Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/12/21/18149099/delete-facebook-scandals-2018-cambridge-analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;data scandal&lt;/a&gt; (Andreessen, an early investor, still sits on Facebook’s board). Every revelation of social media’s tendency to foster society’s worst forces poses a challenge to his and his firm’s trademark techno-evangelism. And in the conference rooms of Sand Hill Road, stakes in the next Instagram, Twitter or Skype—three of its best-known early deals—are no longer the upstart VC firm’s for the taking. Today there are a record number of rival billion-dollar funds and a newer kid on the block in SoftBank, which, armed with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-27/masayoshi-son-softbank-and-the-100-billion-blitz-on-sand-hill-road&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;$100 billion megafund&lt;/a&gt;, makes them all—Andreessen Horowitz included—look quaint. And one thing about saying you’re going to fix a broken industry—you create plenty of competitors who won’t hesitate to capitalize on even a whiff of doubt that you can back up the hype with results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Andreessen and Horowitz, who rank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-andreessen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;55th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/ben-horowitz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;73rd&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, on this year’s Forbes &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbes.com/midas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Midas List&lt;/a&gt;, intend to be disagreeable themselves. They just finished raising a soon-to-be announced $2 billion fund (bringing total assets under management to nearly $10 billion) to write even bigger checks for portfolio companies and unicorns the firm missed the first time. More aggressively, they tell &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that they are registering their entire firm—a costly move requiring reviews of all 150 people—as a financial advisor, renouncing Andreessen Horowitz’s status as a venture capital firm entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, venture capitalists have long traded a lack of Wall Street-style oversight for the promise that they invest mainly in new shares of private companies. It was a tradeoff firms gladly made—until the age of crypto, a type of high-risk investment the SEC says requires more oversight. So be it, says Andreessen Horowitz. By renouncing its venture capital status, it’ll be able to go deeper on riskier bets: If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or tokens, or buy unlimited shares in public companies or from other investors, it can. And in doing so, the thinking goes, it’ll again make other firms feel like they have one hand tied behind their back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What else are feathers for? They just like to get ruffled,” Andreessen says with a smirk. “The thing that stands out is the thing that’s different.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rom the beginning, Andreessen Horowitz had a simple credo: “We wanted to build the venture capital firm that we always wanted to take money from,” Horowitz says. Andreessen, whose Netscape breakthrough landed him on the cover of &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960219,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by age 24, didn’t need the fame. And neither needed the money. Colleagues at Netscape, they then cofounded a company that eventually became Opsware, run by Horowitz, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=170105&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;sold it to HP&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 for $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before founding their venture firm two years later, the pair dabbled in angel investing, where they gained a rebellious reputation, at least by the khakis-and-button-down standards of the Sand Hill Road crowd. Andreessen helped popularize startup advice through his “pmarca” &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmarchive.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual predecessor of his ­Twitter stream, which became known for its surprise 140-character micro-essays on subjects from economic theory to net neutrality. (He’s widely credited with popularizing the term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tweet-stormed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt;.”) Horowitz, meanwhile, had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/technology/blogger-uses-rap-to-teach-pithy-business-lessons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; for his ability to cite rap lyrics and his fandom for the relatively rough-and-tumble Oakland Raiders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build their VC firm, Andreessen and Horowitz modeled their brand strategy not on the industry’s elite but on Larry Ellison’s Oracle and its aggressive marketing during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/765003/1/oracle-and-siebel-wage-a-war-of-words.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;enterprise software wars&lt;/a&gt;. They embraced the media, hosted star-studded events and badmouthed traditional venture capital to anyone who would listen. And while they started with small seed checks to companies like Okta (now valued at $9 billion) and Slack ($7 billion), they ignored traditional wisdom and gobbled up shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook when those companies were already valued in the billions. For one investor in their funds, Prince­ton University’s chief investment officer Andrew Golden, it became a running joke how long it would take for other firms to complain about Andreessen Horowitz. “In the early days, it was within two minutes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andreessen Horowitz staff at the company's headquarters on Sand Hill Road.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by prior exits and some scrimping, Andreessen and Horowitz reinvested their money in the business, whose structure was modeled more on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2016/09/an-interview-with-james-andrew-miller-about-powerhouse-the-untold-story-of-hollywoods-creative-artists-agency.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Hollywood talent agency&lt;/a&gt; than a traditional venture capital firm. Neither drew a salary for years, and new general partners at the firm took lower salaries than is typical. Instead, much of its fees, the traditional 2% of funds managed that covers all of a firm’s expenses, went into a fast-growing services team, including experts in marketing, business development, finance and recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to raise another funding round? Andreessen Horowitz specialists would give you “superpowers,” helping write your presentation, then coaching you through dozens of dry runs before scheduling the meets. Need a vice president of engineering? The firm’s talent team would identify and tap the best search firm, monitor its effectiveness and help choose the best candidate for the job. Human re­sources problem? Accounting crisis? “If something is going off the rails, you have the ‘Batphone,’ ” says Lea Endres, the CEO of NationBuilder, which makes software for nonprofit and political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the firm’s executive briefing centers at headquarters and in a New York satellite office, Andreessen Horowitz staff played matchmaker, enticing big corporations and government agencies with the prospect of seeing cutting-edge tech, then lining up relevant portfolio startups to present to the visitors. GitHub, the open-source-code repository the firm backed in 2012 before it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/microsoft-closes-its-7-5b-purchase-of-code-sharing-platform-github/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft for $7.5 billion, found the briefings so lucrative—good for $20 million in new recurring revenue in 2015 and 2016—that it posted a junior staffer to hang around the Andreessen Horowitz office full-time, its sales chief says. Consumer startups like the grocery delivery unicorn Instacart (a 2014 investment that now has a $7.9 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instacart-funding/instacart-wins-271-million-in-new-funding-in-november-source-idUSKCN1NJ2TY?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;valuation&lt;/a&gt;) scored partnerships with national retailers and food brands. On a recent visit in March, a dozen startups filed through one by one to meet with the Defense Innovation Unit, the branch of the Department of Defense that helps U.S. armed forces find and pay for new technologies. The day before, it was Hachette Book Group. “We’ve had companies where it’s 40% to 60% of their pipeline, and I’m like, whoa, wait, we are not your sales force,” says Martin Casado, an enterprise-focused general partner at the firm who sold his Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup, Nicira, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/07/vmware-buys-nicira/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;for $1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula worked. The firm’s first and third flagship funds, $300 million and $900 million, respectively, are already expected to return five times their money to investors, sources say. Its $650 million second fund and $1.7 billion fourth fund are expected to return three times their investment capital, good for the top quartile of firms, and are expected to climb. A $1.6 billion fifth fund, from 2016, is too young for estimated returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may be unwilling to credit Andreessen Horowitz publicly, other firms have clearly followed suit. From bloggers and podcast experts to resident finance officers and security experts, the number of non-investor professionals in the venture industry has swelled in recent years. “The idea of providing services, that feels like a table-stakes item now,” says Semil Shah, general partner at venture firm Haystack. “A lot of firms copied that.” At Okta, cofounder Frederic Kerrest says he’s routinely approached by other firms curious about building their own briefing centers to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-embed-link color-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/midas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5c9bd95931358e79cabfd46f/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;amp;cropX2=1920&amp;amp;cropY1=-1&amp;amp;cropY2=457&quot; alt=&quot;uncaptioned image&quot; data-height=&quot;458&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll this crowing and nose-thumbing has made enemies. Other investors never forgot how Andreessen Horowitz claimed the business was broken and it alone had the recipe to fix it. Almost from the beginning, gossip about the firm overpaying for deals was rampant, enough so that when Andreessen and Horowitz set out to raise their third main fund in 2012, the partners had to check every position with their port­folio companies so they could disprove the notion with their investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, their failed investments—and there have been high-profile ones, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/15/clunk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Clinkle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Jawbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-billion-dollar-startup-fab-died-2015-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Fab&lt;/a&gt;—and big missteps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-amid-scandal/#238c475a8314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Zenefits&lt;/a&gt; get magnified. Andreessen Horowitz’s well-publicized view, one it still holds, was that what matters is not how many companies you back that fail but how many become massive, outlier successes. Andreessen argues that only 15 deals per year generate all the returns, and he’s intent on seeing all the hot deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swinging for home runs magnifies whiffs, and Andreessen Horowitz blew the highest-profile Midas-list mover of recent years: Uber. The firm doesn’t admit to it now, but several sources with knowledge of the fundraising reveal just how close the firm was to getting a big stake—before letting it slip through its grasp. The until-now mostly untold story: In the fall of 2011, Uber’s ­cofounder Travis Kalanick was raising a red-hot Series B funding round and was keen to have Andreessen Horowitz lead. The firm, Andreessen in particular, was just as hungry to make it happen. By early October, Kalanick was calling other firms to tell them he had a handshake in place with Andreessen and another partner at a value somewhere around $300 million. At the 11th hour, however, the firm blinked. It would still invest, but with a structure that would value Uber at significantly less—$220 million, not counting the investment or an employee option pool, according to an email from Kalanick obtained by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They tried to surprise us,” Kalanick wrote his investors. “So here we are. The next phase of Uber begins.” Kalanick instead turned to Menlo Ventures—which until then was being used as a stalking horse for leverage—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/uber-announces-32-million-in-funding/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt; its $290 million price pre-deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Andreessen Horowitz backed Uber rival Lyft in 2013 and has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-sells-some-lyft-shares-to-prince-al-waleed-1455145074&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;already cashed out&lt;/a&gt; some of those shares at a profit, the firm wasn’t done with Uber. It participated in merger discussions between the two ride-hailing companies in 2014 and again in 2016, according to sources involved in the talks. If the deal had gone through, it would have given the firm a backdoor route to a piece of Uber. Either way, it’s hard to ignore Uber as the one that got away. The ride-hailing company, now valued at $76 billion, is getting ready for an IPO that could be four or fives times larger than Lyft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/03/29/investor-interest-drives-lyft-to-24-billion-valuation-but-it-still-wont-make-founders-billionaires/#368e9d4a4ba6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;was in March&lt;/a&gt;. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment on Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen Horowitz’s leadership has taken other raps. It was slow to diversify its management ranks—as recently as last year’s Midas List, all ten general partners, the people who actually control investments and write checks, were men—in part because it had a rule that GPs were required to be ex-startup founders and couldn’t rise up from the inside. In the past year they’ve added three women GPs but not before bleeding top talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote-embed embed-32 bg-accent color-base font-accent bleed&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By renouncing venture capital status, Andreessen Horowitz says it’ll go deeper on riskier bets: If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or buy unlimited amounts of shares in public companies or from other investors, it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen himself was caught on the wrong side of a fast-changing cultural climate in Silicon Valley in the months leading up to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, responding chummily &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/6708/marc-andreessen-twitter-faves-alt-right?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=cm6trcdl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;by tweet&lt;/a&gt; to the now-banned far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/mark-zuckerberg-marc-andreessens-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;seeming to joke&lt;/a&gt;, after India refused a new Facebook service, that the country might have fared better under colonial rule—earning a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102645335962321&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;rare scolding&lt;/a&gt; from Mark Zuckerberg. In response, Andreessen became a digital recluse, deleting most of his past tweets. Andreessen says the purge wasn’t due to the backlash against his Facebook positions, though “that didn’t help”; rather, he blames “the general climate,” specifically in politics and culture. He may come back, he says, when things “go back to normal,” perhaps in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Andreessen and Horowitz have quieted down their bluster in recent years. Andreessen admits that, contrary to what they maintained when they were Young Turks, “venture capital wasn’t an industry in crisis,” but says it doesn’t matter how the firm got to its top-tier position. Horowitz goes further. “I kind of regret it, because I feel like I hurt people’s feelings who were perfectly good businesses,” he says. “I went too far.” As for the firm’s hiring rules, which contributed to its failure to add a woman GP, he admits it was hard for him to change something that had been such a core part of the firm’s outward-facing identity. “It’s a kind of a big thing for especially me to eat crow on,” he says. “It took probably longer than it should’ve to change it, but we changed it.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arlier this spring, a small group of Andreessen Horowitz executives gathers in a bright little conference room at its headquarters for a pitch meeting with a pair of founders from a low-profile but in-demand biotech company. The twist: The VCs are pitching the entrepreneurs, with operating team leaders advertising their own services to the startup, a health diagnostics company still in stealth mode. The entrepreneurs appear skeptical. When they met Andreessen Horo­witz two years ago, after it wrote a small check in their seed round, the firm didn’t have much to offer bio startups. So for the next hour, they’re treated to example after example of how Andreessen Horowitz has added dedicated experts and connections to companies like UnitedHealth and Kaiser Permanente over the past 18 months. “We’ve found that a biotech company in Silicon Valley is really different from building just a tech company,” Shannon Schiltz, the firm’s technical talent chief, says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reverse pitch is emblematic of the new-version Andreessen Horowitz. Besides turning the typical venture capital process on its head, the firm is investing in biotech, which it once said it would never touch. But scale and the pursuit of challengers to the status quo means pushing into new areas, and the firm has raised $650 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/11/18/andreessen-horowitz-launches-biotech-software-fund/#195276477968&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;across two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-450-million-bio-fund/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;funds&lt;/a&gt; for the sector. “The brand doesn’t carry the weight in bio that it does in the tech community yet,” says Jorge Conde, a general partner since 2017. “But we’ve made a concerted effort and planted the flag.” Specialists like Conde, who led strategy for Syros, a public genetics company, and cofounded a genome startup, are now the norm. Partners meet in committees by topic three times a week to evaluate deals, then convene as one firm on Mondays and Fridays to review likely investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to crypto. Last year the firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/06/25/a16z-hires-first-female-gp-for-crypto-fund/#3151e3e03b04&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;raised a $350 million fund&lt;/a&gt; in the up-and-down area. But until recently partners Chris Dixon and Katie Haun would meet in private with Horo­witz, their fund technically a separate legal entity from the rest of the firm. That meant they had different emails addresses and their own website, because of legal constraints on funds that register as traditional VCs. While Andreessen Horowitz was an early investor in crypto marketplace Coinbase and was one of many firms to catch cryptocurrency fever in 2017, it’s one of the few that doubled down even after the price of bitcoin and ether flatlined. SEC regulations consider such investments “high risk” and limit these stakes, as well as secondary purchases and fund or token investments, to no more than 20% of a traditional VC fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Andreessen Horowitz spent the spring embarking on one of its more disagreeable moves so far: The firm renounced its VC exemptions and registered as a financial advisor, with paperwork completed in March. It’s a costly, painful move that requires hiring compliance officers, audits for each employee and a ban on its investors talking up the portfolio or fund performance in public—even on its own podcast. The benefit: The firm’s partners can share deals freely again, with a real estate expert tag-teaming a deal with a crypto expert on, say, a blockchain startup for home buying, Haun says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’ll come in handy when the firm announces a new growth fund—expected to close in the coming weeks, a source says—that will add a fresh $2 billion to $2.5 billion for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/andreessen-horowitz-hires-its-15th-general-partner/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;newest partner&lt;/a&gt;, David George, to invest across the portfolio and in other larger, high-growth companies. Under the new rules, that fund will be able to buy up shares from founders and early investors—or trade public stocks. Along with a fund &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/08/13/a16z-venture-fund-black-celebrities-kevin-durant.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that connects African-American leaders to startups, the new growth fund will give Andreessen Horowitz four specialized funds, with more potentially to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how the firm plans to keep up in a crowded VC landscape that experts say is bifurcating between specialist seed funds and a handful of giant, all-purpose firms. Traditional firms face more pressure than ever from the top and bottom of the funnel because of more sophisticated angel investor groups and non-VC giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund, says Ilya Strebulaev, a Stanford professor who studies the industry. “Venture capital is in flux,” he says. “We should expect a lot of fundamental changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are inevitable, like the industry’s wising up to the Andreessen Horowitz playbook of using services as a deal sweetener. Or the inherent limits to the Andreessen Horowitz model, which will always require large and growing funds to cover expenses. Others are fixable, like mixed report cards from former operating employees. High pay isn’t enough for ambitious, younger staff to stick around long when there’s little chance of upward mobility, they say. And with veterans of Andreessen and Horowitz’s old company, Opsware, still spread throughout the firm, the sense that some employees get special treatment—and are immune to sanction—can sap morale. Meanwhile, the firm’s insistence on calling everyone a partner, even its most junior talent or accounting managers, might seem harmless, or an annoyance for others in the industry at worst. But if those titles are limiting the prospects of promotion and career growth, as one former partner notes, they may need to be retired like the firm’s old GP rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most risky: Being the best-known VC firm on the block, or the one competitors mock until they copy, won’t matter if sweeping changes come for the entire industry. The world continues to wake up to the degree of power and influence big tech companies like Facebook and Google have over society—from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/21/facebook-reexamine-how-recently-live-videos-are-flagged-after-christchurch-shooting/?utm_term=.3a430461c47d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;livestreaming video&lt;/a&gt; of the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooter to YouTube videos that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-youtube-pulled-these-men-down-a-vortex-of-far-right-hate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;united far-flung white nationalists&lt;/a&gt;—and to the likelihood they haven’t fully owned up to their responsibilities. Against such changing tides, the historical VC narrative of hyper-growth and Zuckerberg-like ambitions may fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a choice that could be equal parts intransigence or naiveté, Andreessen invokes Facebook’s CEO as precisely the example of the kind of disagreeable founder who has the resolve to take the necessary, wrenching steps to make things right. “He just put out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/facebook-privacy-blog.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; talking about basically reinventing Facebook around privacy and messaging,” Andreessen says in March. “Just close your eyes and imagine a classic guy in a suit doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though Andreessen says he’s too busy running the firm to have any hobbies—he’s reminded he has a young son now, too—he gives his own, grander twist to a quote from one of his favorite new TV shows, HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, to describe the mindset necessary to pull it off: “If you can’t ride two elephants at the same time, what are you doing at the circus?”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>25 Years Later: Interview with Linus Torvalds</title>
<link>https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;'s very first issue featured an interview between &lt;em&gt;LJ&lt;/em&gt;'s first Publisher, Robert Young (who went on to co-found Red Hat among other things), and Linus Torvalds (author of the Linux kernel). After 25 years, we thought it'd be interesting to get the two of them together again. You can read that first interview from 1994 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2736&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interview: Linus Torvalds and Robert Young&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Young:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a great pleasure to have an excuse to reach out to you. How are you and your family? Your kids must be through college by now. Nancy and I and our three daughters are all doing well. Our eldest, Zoe, who was 11 when Marc and I started Red Hat, is expecting her second child—meaning I'm a grandparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus Torvalds:&lt;/strong&gt; None of my kids are actually &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with college yet, although Patricia (oldest) will graduate this May. And Celeste (youngest) is in her senior year of high school, so we'll be empty-nesters in about six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three are doing fine, and I suspect/hope it will be a few years until the grandparent thing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; When I first interviewed you back in 1994, did you think that you'd be still maintaining this thing in 2019?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that by 1994 I had already become surprised that my latest project hadn't just been another &quot;do something interesting until it does everything I needed, and then find something else to do&quot; project. Sure, it was fairly early in the development, but it had already been something that I had spent a few years on by then, and had already become something with its own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I'm trying to say is not that I necessarily expected to do it for another few decades, but that it had already passed the bump of becoming something fairly big in my life. I've never really had a long-term plan for Linux, and I have taken things one day at a time rather than worry about something five or ten years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a famous old quote about the danger of achieving your dreams—your running joke back in the day when asked about your future goals for Linux was &quot;world domination&quot;. Now that you and the broader Open Source/Free Software community have achieved that, what's next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I stopped doing the &quot;world domination&quot; joke long ago, because it seemed to become less of a joke as time went on. But it always &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a joke, and it wasn't why I (or any of the other developers) really did what we did anyway. It was always about just making better technology and having interesting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And none of that has really changed on a core level. All the details have changed—the hardware is very different, the problems we have are very different, and my role is very different. But the whole &quot;make it better and have interesting challenges&quot; is all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, back in 1994, I was mostly a developer. Sure, I was the lead maintainer, but while I spent a lot of time merging patches, I was also mostly writing my own code. These days I seldom write much code, and the code I write is often pseudo-code or example patches that I send out in emails to the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; developers. I'd hesitate to call myself a &quot;manager&quot;, because I don't really do things like yearly reviews or budgets, etc. (thank God!), but I definitely am more of a technical lead person than an actual programmer, and that's been true for the last many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the truly big-picture thing hasn't changed, but my role and all the details obviously look very very different from 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Where will you and this code base be in another quarter century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I'll be 75 by then, and I doubt I'll be involved day to day. But considering that I've been doing this for almost 30 years, maybe I'd still be following the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the good news is that we really do have a pretty solid developer base, and I'm not worried about &quot;where will Linus be&quot; kind of issues. Sure, people have been talking about how kernel developers are getting older for a long time now, but that's not really because we wouldn't be getting any new people, it's literally because we still have a lot of people around that have been around for a long time, and still enjoy doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that some radical new and exciting OS would come around and supplant Linux some day (hey, back in 1994 I probably still thought that maybe Hurd would do it!), but it's not just that we've been doing this for a long time and are still doing very well, I've also come to realize that making a new operating system is just way harder than I ever thought. It really takes a lot of effort by a lot of people, and the strength of Linux—and open source in general, of course—is very much that you can build on top of the effort of all those other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unless there is some absolutely enormous shift in the computing landscape, I think Linux will be doing quite well another quarter century from now. Not because of any particular detail of the code itself, but simply fundamentally, because of the development model and the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not be active at that point, and a lot of the code will have been updated and replaced, but I think the project will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you and the kernel team been updating the kernel code to your satisfaction through the years? Is there any need or pressure to re-write any of the 25-year-old ever-expanding Linux code base? Perhaps in a more &quot;modern&quot; language than C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; We've gone through many many big rewrites of most of the subsystems over the years—not all at once, of course—and many pieces of code end up being things that nobody really wants to modify any more (most often because they are drivers for ancient hardware that very few people really use, but that we still support). But one of the advantages of a big unified source base for the whole kernel has been that when we need to make some big change, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do so. There may be a few out-of-tree drivers, etc., around (both source and binary), but we've always had a policy that if they are out of tree, they don't matter for development. So we can make radical changes when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to C, nothing better has come around. We've updated the kernel sources for new and improved features (the C language itself has changed during the years we've been doing this), and we've added various extensions on top of C for extra type-checking and runtime verification and hardening, etc., but on the whole, the language is recognizably the same except for small details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, it doesn't look likely to change. The kind of languages people see under active development aren't for low-level system programming. They are to make it easier to create user applications with fancy UIs, etc. They explicitly don't want to do things a kernel needs, like low-level manual memory management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could imagine that we'd have some &quot;framework&quot; language for generating drivers or similar, and we internally actually have our own simplified &quot;language&quot; just for doing configuration, and we do use a few other languages for the build process, so it's not like C is the only language we use. But it's the bulk of it by far, and it's what the &quot;kernel proper&quot; is written in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; What's your hardware instrument of choice? Is there a Stradivarius of Linux (or any) laptops out there? Or tablet or phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; My main development machine is a very generic PC workstation. It's a franken-machine with different parts cobbled together over the years. It's nothing particularly special, and it's actually been two years since I made any big changes to it, so it's not even anything bleeding-edge. My main requirement at home is actually that it be basically entirely silent. Outside a couple fans, there are no moving parts (so no spinning disks anywhere), and the fans are not even running most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the road (which is happily not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; often), my main requirement is a good screen and being lightweight. My target weight is 1kg (with charger), and honestly, I've not been able to hit that ideal target, but right now, the best compromise for me is the XPS13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems Linux on the desktop's success was not on the PC desktop but on the device desktop via Android. What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the traditional PC is obviously no longer quite the dominant thing it used to be. Even when you have one (and even when it's still running Windows or OS X), lots of people mainly interact with it through a web browser and a couple random apps. Of course, then there are the &quot;workstation&quot; users, which is kind of the desktop I was personally always envisioning. And while still important, it doesn't seem to drive the market the way the PC did back when. Powerful desktop machines seem to be mostly about development or gaming, or media editing. The &quot;casual&quot; desktop seems to have become more of a browser thing, and quite often it's just a tablet or a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome seems to be doing fine in some of that area too, of course. But yes, in just numbers of people interacting daily with Linux, Android is obviously the huge bulk of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note from Bob: In the strict sense of &quot;dominant&quot;, this is probably fair. But despite the recent fall in total numbers of PCs shipped in the last couple years, the cumulative growth in the PC market between 1994 and, say, 2014 is such that even in a slow PC market today, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-chart-shows-how-mobile-has-crushed-pcs-2016-04-20&quot;&gt;world is still installing four or five times as many PCs every year compared to 1994&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; If you had to fix one thing about the networked world, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/u%5Buid%5D/linus-small.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; alt=&quot;Linus Torvalds&quot; class=&quot;image-max_650x650&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linus Torvalds (Image Courtesy of Peter Adams, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facesofopensource.com/&quot;&gt;The Faces of Open Source Project&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing technical. But, I absolutely detest modern &quot;social media&quot;—Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It's a disease. It seems to encourage bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think part of it is something that email shares too, and that I've said before: &quot;On the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle&quot;. When you're not talking to somebody face to face, and you miss all the normal social cues, it's easy to miss humor and sarcasm, but it's also very easy to overlook the reaction of the recipient, so you get things like flame wars, etc., that might not happen as easily with face-to-face interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But email still &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. You still have to put in the effort to write it, and there's generally some actual content (technical or otherwise). The whole &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; model is just garbage. There is no effort and no quality control. In fact, it's all geared to the &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; of quality control, with lowest common denominator targets, and click-bait, and things designed to generate an emotional response, often one of moral outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add in anonymity, and it's just disgusting. When you don't even put your real name on your garbage (or the garbage you share or like), it really doesn't help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually one of those people who thinks that anonymity is overrated. Some people confuse privacy and anonymity and think they go hand in hand, and that protecting privacy means that you need to protect anonymity. I think that's wrong. Anonymity is important if you're a whistle-blower, but if you cannot prove your identity, your crazy rant on some social-media platform shouldn't be visible, and you shouldn't be able to share it or like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Rant over. I'm not on any social media (I tried G+ for a while, because the people on it weren't the mindless usual stuff, but it obviously never went anywhere), but it still annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; This issue of &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Kids and Linux. Is there any advice you'd like to give to young programmers/computer science students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm actually the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; person to ask. I knew I was interested in math and computers since an early age, and I was largely self-taught until university. And everything I did was fairly self-driven. So I don't understand the problems people face when they say &quot;what should I do?&quot; It's not where I came from at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; The very first time you and I met was at a Digital Equipment Company (DEC) tradeshow. It was on your very first trip to the US that Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall and DEC financed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I think actually that was my second trip to the US. The first was, I believe, a trip for me to Provo, Utah, to talk with Novell about Linux (for a project inside Novell that was then to become Caldera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, the DECUS tradeshow (in New Orleans? Maybe I misremember) was certainly among my earliest trips to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; I asked how you were going to catch up with all the emails you missed by the time you returned to Helsinki. Your answer surprised me, and I've been quoting you ever since. You simply said you would send the backlog of emails to /dev/null. I expressed shock and asked you, &quot;but what if there were important emails in your inbox?&quot; You shrugged and replied, &quot;If it was important, the writer would just send it again.&quot; Possibly the most liberating piece of advice anyone had ever given me. Do you still follow that philosophy of email handling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; It's still somewhat true, but at the same time, I've also changed my workflow a lot so that travel wouldn't be as disruptive to my work as it used to be. So these days I often strive to have people not even notice when I'm on the road all that much. I will give people a heads-up if I expect to be without much internet connectivity for more than a day or two (which still happens in some places of the world—particularly if you're a scuba diver), but most of the time, I can do my work from anywhere in the world. And I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes fail) to time my trips so that they're not in the merge window for me, which is when I get the most pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these days I keep all my email in the cloud, which makes it much easier to switch between machines, and it means that when I travel and use my laptop, it's not nearly as much of a pain as it used to be back in the days when I downloaded all my email to my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's not just about my email—the fact that almost all the kernel development ends up being distributed through git also means that it's much less of an issue what machine I am at, and synchronization is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier than it used to be back when I was working with patches coming in individually through email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, my &quot;if it's really important, people will re-send&quot; belief stands. People know that I'm around pretty much 7/365, and if I don't react to a pull request in a couple days, it still means that it might have gotten lost in the chaos that is my email, and people send me a follow-up email to ping me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's actually much less common than it used to be. Back in 1994, I wasn't all that overworked, and being gone a week wasn't a big deal, but it got progressively worse during the next few years, to the point where our old email-and-patches-based workflow really meant that I would sometimes have to skip patches because I didn't have the time for them, knowing that people would re-send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those times are all happily long gone. BitKeeper made a big difference for me, even if not all maintainers liked it (or used it). And now git means that I don't get thousands of patches by email any more, and my inbox doesn't look as bad as it used to be. So it's easier to stay on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, perhaps even more important than the &quot;If it was important the writer would just send it again&quot; rule is another rule I've had for the longest time: if I don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to reply, I don't. If I get a piece of email and my reaction is that somebody else could have handled it, I will just ignore it. Some busy email people have an automatic reply saying &quot;sorry, I'll try to get to your email eventually&quot;. Me, I just ignore anything where I feel it doesn't absolutely concern me. I do that simply because I feel like I can't afford to encourage people to email me more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I get a lot of email, but I don't actually &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; most of it at all. In a very real sense, much of my job is to be on top of things and know what's going on. So I see a lot of emails, but I don't usually write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; At a talk at the Washington DC Linux user group meeting back in May 1995, that Don Becker organized, you stopped halfway through and asked the audience if anyone knew the score of the Finland-Sweden men's world championship hockey game. As the token Canadian in the room, I was able to assure you that Finland won that game. On that topic: Finland's recent win of the World Junior Championship must have been fun for you. Or were you cheering for the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh. Hockey may be the Finnish national sport (and playing against Sweden makes it more personal—I &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; Swedish as my mother language, but I'm &lt;em&gt;Finnish&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to nationality), but I'm not a huge sports fan. And moving to the US didn't mean that I picked up baseball and football, it just meant that ice hockey lost that &quot;people around me cared&quot; part too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of us admire your willingness to call a spade a spade in public debates on Linux technology decisions. Others, um, dislike your forthright style of arguing. Do you think you are becoming more or less diplomatic as time has goes on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; If anything, I think I have become quieter. I wouldn't say &quot;more diplomatic&quot;, but perhaps more self-aware, and I'm trying to be less forceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it is that people read me a different way from how they used to. It used to be a more free-wheeling environment, and we were a group of geeks having fun and playing around. It's not quite the same environment any more. It's not as personal, for one thing—we have &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people involved with development now, and that's just counting actual people sending patches, not all the people working around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And part of the whole &quot;read me in a different way&quot; is that people take me seriously in a way they didn't do back in 1994. And that's absolutely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; some kind of complaint about how I wasn't taken seriously back then—quite the reverse. It's more me grumbling that people take me much too seriously now, and I can't say silly stupid cr*p any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll still call out people (and particularly companies) for doing dumb things, but now I have to do it knowing that it's news, and me giving some company the finger will be remembered for a decade afterwards. Whether deserved or not, it might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob:&lt;/strong&gt; Anything else you want to comment on, either publicly or otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus:&lt;/strong&gt; I've never had some &quot;message&quot; that I wanted to spread, so ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About Robert Young and What He's Been Up to in the Past 25 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduating from the University of Toronto in 1976 after studying history, Young took a job selling typewriters. In 1978, he founded his first company and then spent 15 years in Canada at the helm of two computer-leasing companies. He sold the second of these to a larger firm who moved him to Connecticut in 1992 to grow their small US subsidiary. Shortly after, the new parent company ran into financial difficulties, otherwise known as bankruptcy, and Young found himself working out of his wife's sewing closet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/u%5Buid%5D/robert-young-small.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;487&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; alt=&quot;Robert Young&quot; class=&quot;image-max_650x650&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert Young, &lt;em&gt;LJ&lt;/em&gt;'s First Publisher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although that event led directly to, in 1993, co-founding Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) with Marc Ewing, a young North Carolina-based software engineer. Both of them had fallen in love with free software, now known as open source—Ewing because he could innovate with software that came with source code and a license that allowed him to innovate, and Young because he could see how technology customers could be better served with open technology than the closed proprietary alternatives the industry offered at the time. Serving as CEO from founding through Red Hat's IPO in 1999, he then moved to the role of Chairman, and the brilliant Matthew Szulik took over as CEO, building the early Red Hat into a great business. Red Hat is now a member of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index of the largest US public companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Young and Ewing co-founded the Center for Public Domain, a non-profit foundation created to bolster healthy conversation of intellectual property, patent and copyright law, and the management of the public domain for the common good. Grant recipients included the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Young purchased the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League, and he currently serves as the league's Vice-Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with a talented team led by Gart Davis, he helped launch Lulu.com in 2004 as the first online self-publishing services to use print-on-demand technology to enable a new generation of authors to bring their works directly to market, avoiding the delays, expense and limited profitability of publishing through traditional channels. Under the direction of Kathy Hensgen, Lulu continues to be a leading innovator helping authors bring their works to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Young invested in PrecisionHawk, a small drone company led by Ernie Earon and Christopher Dean. PrecisionHawk, based in Raleigh, has become one of the leading drone technology companies in the US. He continues to serve as Chairman, with CEO Michael Chasen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, Young has been involved with Scott Mitchell and a team based in Toronto, helping organize the Canadian Premier League, a professional soccer league in Canada. He owns the Hamilton Forge franchise. The league will begin play this month (April 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favorite current project is helping his wife Nancy run Raleigh-based Elizabeth Bradley Design Ltd and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://needlepoint.com&quot;&gt;Needlepoint.com&lt;/a&gt; store, a leading needlepoint supplier. Their mission is nothing less than to make the world a more beautiful place, by growing the community of enthusiastic needlepointers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most beloved pastime is spending time with his growing family. He and his wife Nancy welcomed their first grandchild a year ago. Young also enjoys pursuing a bunch of hobbies, always badly. These include fly fishing, kite boarding, golf, and he collects the occasional antique typewriter—a nod to his beginnings as a typewriter salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sidenote: the Faces of Open Source Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peteradamsphoto.com/people/linus-torvalds&quot;&gt;photo of Linus&lt;/a&gt; in this article is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peteradamsphoto.com&quot;&gt;Peter Adams&lt;/a&gt;, a photographer I met a few months ago when he introduced me to a series he started in 2014 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://facesofopensource.com&quot;&gt;Faces of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;. On that site, Peter writes, &quot;Despite its wide ranging impact, the open source revolution remains all but unknown to most people who now, more than ever before, depend on its survival. This project is an attempt to change that.&quot; His purpose applies not only to the muggles who rely on open source, but to the wizards who write their own code and put it to use. Knowing who created the Open Source world we have now will surely help as we code up a future that embodies the same good values.—Doc Searls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Asking for Some New Users&amp;#039; Email Passwords</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks after admitting it stored hundreds of millions of its users’ own passwords insecurely, Facebook is demanding some users fork over the password for their outside email account as the price of admission to the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook users are being interrupted by an interstitial demanding they provide the password for the email account they gave to Facebook when signing up. “To continue using Facebook, you’ll need to confirm your email,” the message demands. “Since you signed up with [email address], you can do that automatically …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form below the message asked for the users’ “email password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s beyond sketchy,” security consultant Jake Williams told the Daily Beast. “They should not be taking your password or handling your password in the background. If that’s what’s required to sign up with Facebook, you’re better off not being on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement emailed to The Daily Beast after this story published, Facebook reiterated its claim it doesn’t store the email passwords. But the company also announced it will end the practice altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand the password verification option isn’t the best way to go about this, so we are going to stop offering it,” Facebook wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how widely the new measure was deployed, but in its statement Facebook said users retain the option of bypassing the password demand and activating their account through more conventional means, such as “a code sent to their phone or a link sent to their email.” Those options are presented to users who click on the words “Need help?” in one corner of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional login step &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/originalesushi/status/1112496649891430401&quot;&gt;was noticed&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend by a cybersecurity watcher on Twitter called “e-sushi.” The Daily Beast tested the claim by establishing a new Facebook account under circumstances the company’s system might flag as suspicious, using a disposable webmail address and connecting through a VPN in Romania. A reporter was taken to the same screen demanding the email password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By going down that road, you're practically fishing for passwords you are not supposed to know!,” e-sushi wrote in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small print below the password field promises, “Facebook won’t store your password.” But the company has recently been criticized for repurposing information it originally acquired for “security” reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-lets-anyone-view-your-profile-with-2fa-phone-number&quot;&gt;was caught&lt;/a&gt; allowing advertisers to target its users using phone numbers users provided for two-factor authentication; users handed over their numbers so Facebook could send a text message with a secret code when they log in. More recently the company drew the ire of privacy advocates when it began making those phone numbers searchable, so anyone can locate the matching user “in defiance of user expectations and security best practices,” &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/facebook-doubles-down-misusing-your-phone-number&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also has a checkered history when it comes to securely handling passwords. Last month the company acknowledged that &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/&quot;&gt;unencrypted passwords&lt;/a&gt; for hundreds of millions of its users &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-passwords-in-plain-text-report&quot;&gt;had been stored for years&lt;/a&gt; in company logs accessible to 2,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, amid a steady drum beat of fresh privacy scandals, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unleashed a thousand-word manifesto describing  a new “privacy-focused vision” &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-youve-napped-through-the-last-decade&quot;&gt;for the company&lt;/a&gt; built on strong encryption and cutting-edge security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook’s putative pivot-to-privacy would meet with some skepticism. “[F]rankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>‘Beyond Sketchy’: Facebook Demands Users’ Email Passwords</og:title>
<og:description>Mark Zuckerberg admitted recently that Facebook doesn’t have a ‘strong reputation’ for privacy. An odd new request for private data probably won’t help with that rep.</og:description>

<title>Rare Persian manuscripts dating back to 13th century now online</title>
<link>https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-036/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-036/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/static/managed-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/04/efaerer.jpg#h=822&amp;amp;w=447&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Excerpt from classical Persian poetry. The Rare Persian-Language Manuscript Collection includes beloved poems of the Persian poets Saadi Shirazi, Hafez and Jami, along with works of the poet Nizami Ganjavi.
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of the Persian New Year, also known as Nowruz, the Library of Congress has digitized and made available online for the first time the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/collections/persian-language-rare-materials/about-this-collection/&quot;&gt;Rare Persian-Language Manuscript Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which sheds light on scientific, religious, philosophical and literary topics that are highly valued in the Persian speaking lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection, including 150 manuscripts with some dating back to the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, also reflects the diversity of religious and confessional traditions within the Persian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to the present, Persian became the cultural language for a large region stretching from West Asia to Central and South Asia. Today, Persian is the native language spoken in Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and some regions of Central and South Asia and the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique manuscripts feature beautifully illuminated anthologies of poetry by classic and lesser known poets, written in fine calligraphic styles and illustrated. It includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/plmp.m012/?sp=28&quot;&gt;Shahnamah&lt;/a&gt;, an epic poem that recounts the history of pre-Islamic Persia. Also, it contains the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/plmp.m110/?sp=104&quot;&gt;beloved poems&lt;/a&gt; of the Persian poets Saadi, Hafez, Rumi and Jami, along with works of the poet Nizami Ganjavi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the historic materials addresses the life of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbc0001.2015rosen1791/?sp=468&quot;&gt;Shah Jahan&lt;/a&gt; (1592–1666), a ruler of India from the Mughal dynasty, during whose reign the Taj Mahal and other architectural wonders were built. Other items highlight a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/plmp.m067/?sp=115&quot;&gt;gold leaf map&lt;/a&gt; that clearly demonstrates how the world was viewed in the medieval Islamic period and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/plmp.m132/?sp=8&quot;&gt;Quran manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; with Persian explanations and elaborate calligraphy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection was digitally preserved by the Library of Congress at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/collections/persian-language-rare-materials/about-this-collection/&quot;&gt;loc.gov/collections/persian-language-rare-materials/about-this-collection/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “These rare Persian-language manuscripts clearly reflect the diversity and cosmopolitan nature of the collection,” said Hirad Dinavari, reference specialist for the collection at the Library’s African and Middle Eastern Division. “Since many of the items originate in India, Central Asia, the Caucasus and regions under Ottoman rule, in addition to the native Persian speaking lands of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the manuscripts, the Library will expand the Rare Persian-language Collection with lithographs, early imprint book and Islamic book bindings in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these Persian manuscripts and lithographic books were procured for the Library in the 1930s by Kirkor Minassian (1874-1944), a renowned dealer in fine Islamic and Near Eastern arts. The Minassian acquisitions included treasures from the entire Middle East with rare books and manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Armenian languages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library's African and Middle Eastern Division showcased over 40 of these rare Persian manuscripts and lithographic books for the first time, for the public to see, in the exhibition &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/thousand-years-of-the-persian-book/&quot;&gt;&quot;A Thousand Years of the Persian Book&quot;&lt;/a&gt; between March 27, 2014 and September 20, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rare Persian-Language Manuscript Collection reflects advancement toward a goal in the Library’s new user-centered strategic plan to expand access, making unique collections, experts and services available when, where and how users need them. Learn more about the Library’s five-year plan at&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.gov/strategic-plan/&quot;&gt;loc.gov/strategic-plan/.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/&quot;&gt;African and Middle Eastern Division&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(AMED) was created in 1978 as part of a general Library of Congress reorganization. AMED consists of three sections – African, Hebraic and Near East – that cover 78 countries and regions from southern Africa to the Maghreb and from the Middle East to Central Asia and the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library of Congress is the world’s largest library, offering access to the creative record of the United States – and extensive materials from around the world – both on-site and online. It is the main research arm of the U.S. Congress and the home of the U.S. Copyright Office. Explore collections, reference services and other programs and plan a visit at &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.gov/&quot;&gt;loc.gov&lt;/a&gt;, access the official site for U.S. federal legislative information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://congress.gov/&quot;&gt;congress.gov&lt;/a&gt; and register creative works of authorship at &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.gov/&quot;&gt;copyright.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b4e&quot; id=&quot;5b4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’ve worked for Silicon Valley companies for more than a decade and international travel is a necessary part of my job. I’ve had my fair share of delays and missed connections, but one thing I’ve never experienced while traveling in airports is fear. That changed last December when I returned from a business trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*vDdOq-Or2dTr2Z5kM4DwwA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;3720&quot; data-height=&quot;2483&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*vDdOq-Or2dTr2Z5kM4DwwA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vDdOq-Or2dTr2Z5kM4DwwA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a75c&quot; id=&quot;a75c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Going through customs is usually routine for me. I signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Entry&lt;/a&gt; program years ago. It allows me to bypass lines using an electronic kiosk. With my travel schedule, Global Entry is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e2e&quot; id=&quot;8e2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On this trip, the kiosk directed me to a Customs and Border Patrol agent who kept my passport and sent me to secondary inspection. There I quickly found myself surrounded by three armed agents wearing bullet proof vests. They started to question me aggressively regarding my trip, my current employment, and my past work for Mozilla, a non-profit organization dedicated to open technology and online privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;658d&quot; id=&quot;658d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The agents proceeded to search my belongings and demanded that I unlock my smartphone and laptop. This was rather concerning for me. My phone and laptop are property of my employer and contain unreleased software and proprietary information. I’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement promising not to give anyone access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d2db&quot; id=&quot;d2db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because I was uncertain about my legal responsibilities to my employer, I asked the agents if I could speak to my employer or an attorney before unlocking my devices. This request seemed to aggravate the customs officers. They informed me that I had no right to speak to an attorney at the border despite being a U.S. citizen, and threatened me that failure to immediately comply with their demand is a violation of federal criminal code 18 USC 111.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4605&quot; id=&quot;4605&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m not an attorney, and I have no prior experience with federal law enforcement, but I did study the U.S. Constitution as part of my citizenship test three years ago. I wasn’t sure what the legal definition of an unreasonable search and seizure was, but three armed men detaining me, threatening me, and refusing to allow me to consult with an attorney definitely felt like one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3668&quot; id=&quot;3668&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I declined to answer any further questions, and continued to ask to speak to an attorney instead. The interrogation and threats continued for some time, which I endured silently. Despite initial threats that they would keep my devices if I didn’t unlock them, I was eventually permitted to leave the customs area with my devices. The customs agents did however keep my Global Entry card as a punishment for not complying with their demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1ac2&quot; id=&quot;1ac2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I have learned since, my experience was not unique. While CBP has a long history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/border-patrol-dont-call-cages-cages&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/border-patrol-dont-call-cages-cages&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mistreating foreigners, immigrants, and asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; entering the US, more recently CBP has also started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicintegrity.org/immigration/shocked-and-humiliated-lawsuits-accuse-customs-border-officers-of-invasive-searches-of-minors-women/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://publicintegrity.org/immigration/shocked-and-humiliated-lawsuits-accuse-customs-border-officers-of-invasive-searches-of-minors-women/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aggressively question&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses/us-border-patrol-detained-us-citizens-speaking&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses/us-border-patrol-detained-us-citizens-speaking&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unlawfully detain&lt;/a&gt;, and in some cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/13/u-s-family-suing-federal-government-after-11-hour-detention-on-canadian-border/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.1727001cb3eb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/13/u-s-family-suing-federal-government-after-11-hour-detention-on-canadian-border/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.1727001cb3eb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;physically assault&lt;/a&gt; U.S. citizens crossing the border. These so-called border searches are not random. NBC recently reported that CBP maintains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/u-s-officials-made-list-reporters-lawyers-activists-question-border-n980301&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/u-s-officials-made-list-reporters-lawyers-activists-question-border-n980301&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dossiers of U.S. citizens&lt;/a&gt; and targets lawyers, journalists, and activists, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2019/01/10/cbp-finalizes-rules-for-social-media-surveillance/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2019/01/10/cbp-finalizes-rules-for-social-media-surveillance/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monitors social media activity&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. citizens. My past work on encryption and online privacy is well documented, and so is my disapproval of the Trump administration and my history of significant campaign contributions to Democratic candidates. I wonder whether these CBP programs led to me being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2a4e&quot; id=&quot;2a4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If the government intended to scare me, they certainly succeeded. Ever since, I travel in fear. I’ve reduced my international travel and my heart pounds every time I go through U.S. customs. I will, however, not be silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0072&quot; id=&quot;0072&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;When I became a U.S. citizen I swore to defend the Constitution. I’m a proud U.S. citizen and I take my oath seriously. It is in that spirit that I have filed a civil rights complaint with the help of the ACLU against CBP for unlawfully detaining me and violating my constitutional rights. The time is overdue for Congress to step in and provide meaningful oversight and legislation to reign in CBP’s egregious misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sci-Hub and Alexandra Basic Information</title>
<link>https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2019/03/31/sci-hub-and-alexandra-basic-information/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2019/03/31/sci-hub-and-alexandra-basic-information/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a quick summary of facts about Sci-Hub and myself, because in our times you cannot fully trust articles published in media, Wikipedia pages. Well, they do present facts about Sci-Hub that are correct in general, but at the same time there are mistakes in minor details. These details however create incorrect impression about the project. So, I want to make a quick look-up page with basic information about Sci-Hub and me that is reliable and first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will add more information to this page later&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Alexandra Elbakyan and how the project started?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a computer programmer behind Sci-Hub. I created the website in September, 2011 in Almaty, Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, my homeland, access to LiveJournal website was blocked by government. LiveJournal is a blog system, where anyone can write their articles. Hence to access LiveJournal, I had to use ‘anonymizer’ websites. You go to such a website, paste a link to any webpage — for example LiveJournal article — and you can open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got the idea: we need the same for research articles. It took me two or three days to write the code and upload it to free PHP webhosting. And so Sci-Hub got live, and started processing requests from users (it almost immediately became very popular)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I had a dream to write software for easy access to research since 2009. I was an undergaduate student in Kazakh National Tech University and got into problems while trying to access research papers needed for my research project. So I thought it would be cool to write some software to automatically download such papers. However in 2009 it was only a blurry non-specific idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned HTML at age 12 using free tutorial avaiable on the Internet. I started programming in high school and first learned PHP, Delphi and Assembly programming languages on myself, before I got to the university. I was interested in information security and entered Kazakh National Tech University in 2005 to study Information Technologies with a security speicalization. Here I improved programing skills a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation I wanted to continue in science and do research in bioengineering. Apart from computer and information technologies, I was interested in neuroscience, consciousness and artificial intelligence and while studying at university, collected a lot of ebooks on that topic. They were all downloaded from ‘pirate’ websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2010 I tried to work in a few neuroscience research labs in Russia, Germany and United States. I read online that you can write to the professor and s/he will accept you to their lab. So I did the same and that’s how I got into laboratories. Here I also did programming, but for bioengineering applications. However I found it boring. I wanted to work on greater things: such as the Global Brain. I even was lucky to give a talk on that topic in H+ transhumanist conference in Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 I returned to Kazakhstan and worked for a few months as a freelance web-programmer. I created websites and applications on PHP language. And finally I was able to code Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there any funding for Sci-Hub?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no. Sci-Hub started by accident, there was no Big Plan behind it. After a couple of months, users asked to add some option to donate and help the project. Sci-Hub is living on the donations for years. There were some big donations, but there was never any specific funding behind the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was any government involved in creating Sci-Hub?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was interested in politics and always supported communism, but Sci-Hub has always been a personal project. Even if some government helped, for example by sending anonymous donations, it was completely invisible to me. Using the Occam’s razor, no government was involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any team behind Sci-Hub?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and never was. I do all the programming and server configuration myself. I also do all the Twitter posts and communication with users and media. I use Google to search for pictures to use on the website and social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a people though, who create mirrors of Sci-Hub articles database. I run a few mirrors and other mirrors are run independently, and Sci-Hub also uses accounts to access library resources provided by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the relationship between Sci-Hub and Library Genesis projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub started in 2011 as a web application to download research article requested by user, using library accounts. There was no storage for downloaded articles. In 2012 Library Genesis, that collected e-books, wanted to collect research articles too and started saving papers downloaded by Sci-Hub to their database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the number of requests to Sci-Hub grew, and I re-programmed Sci-Hub to check if article was already stored in Libgen; if it was, the user was redirected to Libgen database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I copied articles collected by Libgen to create Sci-Hub’s own database. I did not &lt;strong&gt;fork&lt;/strong&gt; Libgen: only the papers PDF files were copied. Then I configured new servers to serve these files to Sci-Hub users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Sci-Hub uses it’s own servers to store research papers. However all new articles downloaded by Sci-Hub are mirrored to Library Genesis databases too. Libgen also publishes torrents to download these papers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;… and question that is always asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Sci-Hub different from Aaron Swartz?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How different between each other are PLoS One, arXiv.org and Budapest Open Access Initiative? All these projects work on providing free access to research papers, however it is easy to see: there are very different between each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub is a web application that can open research paper requested by user, from database or by downloading it. All downloaded papers are collected in database. The database grew for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Swartz, as far as I know his story, made an attempt to download a few million research papers from JSTOR website in 2010. The download was noticed and he got arrested. Perhaps he wanted to upload all downloaded research articles on torrent. In 2009 I did similar things: I downloaded Nature and Scientific American journal volumes and uploaded them on ‘pirate’ websites where people share e-books, and I also shared there volumes on torrents. A lot of people were doing it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004 I even programmed a PHP script that could automatically download paywalled e-books from MIT Cognet website, using a bug. Even though it sounds very similar to Sci-Hub, it is completely different in design and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Sci-Hub, there were a lot of illegal websites where any person could download e-books for free. Sci-Hub became the first website where you can download articles on a massive scale, not e-books only. Before Sci-Hub there were other websites to get research papers for free but they were also different from Sci-Hub in design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are similarities with A. Swartz but to say they are the same is some kind of an illusion that arises from lack of understanding of complexity. The similar illusion is to think that all black people, or all Chinese people are the same, because white person cannot easily recognize their faces.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Who has the fastest website in F1?</title>
<link>https://jakearchibald.com/2019/f1-perf/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jakearchibald.com/2019/f1-perf/</guid>
<description>&lt;time class=&quot;article-date&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-03-19&quot;&gt;Posted 19 March 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was trying to make my predictions for the new Formula One season by studying the aerodynamics of the cars, their cornering speeds, their ability to run with different amounts of fuel. Then it hit me: I have no idea what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm going to make my predictions the only way I know how: By comparing the performance of their websites. That'll work right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, it'll be interesting to compare 10 sites that have been recently updated, perhaps even rebuilt, and see what the common issues are. I'll also cover the tools and techniques I use to test web performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to put each site through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org&quot;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt; to gather the data on Chrome Canary on a Moto G4 with a 3g connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of us have 4g-enabled data plans, we frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2018/02/state-of-lte&quot;&gt;drop to a slower connection&lt;/a&gt;. A consistent 3g connection will also suggest what the experience would be like in poor connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to use a site while on poor connectivity is massively frustrating, so anything sites can do to make it less of a problem is a huge win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the device, if you look outside the tech bubble, a lot of users can't or don't want to pay for a high-end phone. To get a feel for how a site performs for real users, you have to look at mid-to-lower-end Android devices, which is why I picked the Moto G4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using Chrome Canary because WPT seems to be glitchy with regular Chrome right now. Yeah, not a great reason, but the test wasn't useful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and whenever I talk about resource sizes, I'm talking about downloaded bytes, which means gzip/brotli/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;calculating-race-time&quot;&gt;Calculating race time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of bandwidth your site uses matters, especially for users paying for data by the megabyte. However I'm not going to directly score sites based on this. Instead, I'm going to rate them on how long it takes for them to become interactive. By &quot;interactive&quot;, I mean meaningful content is displayed in a stable way, and the main thread is free enough to react to a tap/click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caching is important, so I'm going to add the first load score to the second load score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some subjectivity there, so I'll try and justify things as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues-with-the-test&quot;&gt;Issues with the test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not comparing how 'good' the website is in terms of design, features etc etc. In fact, &lt;code&gt;about:blank&lt;/code&gt; would win this contest. I love &lt;code&gt;about:blank&lt;/code&gt;. It taught me everything I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm only testing Chrome. Sorry. There's only one of me and I get tired. In fact, with 10 sites to get through, it's possible I'll miss something obvious, but I'll post the raw data so feel free to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only used &quot;methodology&quot; as a heading to try and sound smart. But really, this is fun, not science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, and perhaps most importantly, the results aren't a reflection of the abilities of the developers. We don't know how many were on each project, we don't know what their deadline was or any other constraints. My goal here is to show how I audit sites, and show the kind of gains that are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-round-images&quot;&gt;Bonus round: images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each site I'll take a look at their images, and see if any savings can be made there. My aim is to make the image good-enough on mobile, so I'll resize to a maximum of 1000px wide, for display at no larger than 500px on the device's viewport (so it looks good on high density mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, this is an excuse to aggressively push &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. It's lights out, and away we go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mercedes&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercedes make cars. You might have seen one on a road. They're a big company, so their F1 team is a sub brand. They're also one of the few teams with the same drivers as 2018, so this might not be a 'new' site. Let's take a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/mercedes-amg-f1/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190317_YK_7c6b49c0d79bdfd1f75359c33dcfdb08/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is going to be a longer section than usual as I go through the tools and techniques in more detail. Stick with me. The following sections will be shorter because, well, the technique is mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like WebPageTest as it runs on a real devices, and provides screenshots and a waterfall. From the results above, the median first run is 'Run 3', so let's take a look at the 'Filmstrip view':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-film.ab5379c42db2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience, we've got 6.8s of nothing, then a spinner until 13.7s. Showing a spinner is definitely better than showing nothing, but only just. A full-page spinner is basically an admission of being too slow and apologising to the user. But can it be avoided in this case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebPageTest's waterfall diagram allows us to match this up with network and main thread activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to use WebPageTest to get this kind of overview. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools' &quot;Performance&quot; panel&lt;/a&gt; can give you the same data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how the waterfall has 'steps'. As in, entry 23 is on another step from the things before, and step 50 is on yet another step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that something before those things prevented them from downloading earlier. Usually this means the browser didn't know in advance that it needed that resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green vertical line shows 'first render', but we know from the filmstrip that it's just a spinner. Let's dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green line appears after the first 'step' of items in the waterfall. That suggests one or more of those resources was blocking the render. Viewing the source of the page shows many &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  …
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'text/javascript'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'text/javascript'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.4.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'text/javascript'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/wp-content/plugins/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager/js/gtm4wp-social-tracker.js?ver=1.8.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'text/javascript'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/wp-content/plugins/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager/js/analytics-talk-content-tracking.js?ver=1.8.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'text/javascript'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/wp-content/plugins/events-calendar-pro/src/resources/js/widget-this-week.min.js?ver=4.0.6'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  …
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;block rendering by default&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding the &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; attribute prevents them blocking rendering, but still lets them download early. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitsofco.de/async-vs-defer/&quot;&gt;Ire Aderinokun wrote an excellent article on this&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; to those scripts will allow the page to render before those scripts have executed, but there might be some additional work to ensure it doesn't result in a broken render. Sites that have been render-blocked by JS often come to rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally pages should render top-to-bottom. Components can be enhanced later, but it shouldn't change the dimensions of the component. I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPnEZd6wCtk&quot;&gt;this enactment of reading the Hull Daily Mail website&lt;/a&gt;, especially how they capture the frustration of layout changes as well as popups. Don't be like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, interactive elements like the carousel could display the first item without JS, and JS could add the rest in, plus the interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/before-after-js.679b45a5eb28.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I'd like to see. The before-JS render is missing the elements that require JS for interactivity. Once the JavaScript loads, it adds them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the page source, the HTML contains a lot of content, so they're already doing some kind of server render, but the scripts prevent them from taking advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=190317_YK_7c6b49c0d79bdfd1f75359c33dcfdb08-r:3-c:0&quot;&gt;Over on WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt; you can click on items in the waterfall for more info. Although at this point I find &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/&quot;&gt;Chrome Devtools' &quot;Network&quot; panel&lt;/a&gt; easier to use, especially for looking at the content of the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts weigh in around 150k&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes two versions of jQuery. There's &lt;strong&gt;over 100k of CSS&lt;/strong&gt; too. CSS also blocks rendering by default, but you want it to block for initial styles, else the user will see a flicker of the unstyled page before the CSS loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/code-coverage.61488579e842.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/&quot;&gt;Chrome Devtools' code coverage tool&lt;/a&gt; says over &lt;strong&gt;80% of the CSS is unused for first render&lt;/strong&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;75% of the JS.&lt;/strong&gt; These should be split up so the page is only loading what it needs. For JavaScript, modern build tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rollupjs.org/guide/en&quot;&gt;rollup.js&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://parceljs.org/&quot;&gt;Parcel&lt;/a&gt; support code-splitting for JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting CSS isn't as easy. Keeping CSS tightly coupled with their components makes it easier to identify CSS that isn't needed for a particular page. I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules&quot;&gt;CSS modules&lt;/a&gt; as a way to enforce this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tools that automate extracting 'above the fold' CSS. I've had mixed results with these, but they might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second 'step' of the waterfall contains some render-altering fonts. The browser doesn't know it needs fonts until it finds some text that needs them. That means the CSS downloads, the page is laid out, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the browser realises it needs some fonts. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be a quick-win here. This means the browser will download the fonts within the first step of the waterfall. For more info on preloading, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/preload-what-is-it-good-for/&quot;&gt;Yoav Weiss' article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;strong&gt;fonts weigh in around 350k&lt;/strong&gt;, which is pretty heavy. 280k of this is in TTF. TTF is uncompressed, so it should at least be gzipped, or even better use woff2, which would knock around 180k off the size. &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/really-dislike-fout-font-display-optional-might-jam/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;font-display: optional&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could be considered here, but given it's part of corporate identity, &lt;em&gt;sighhhhhhhh&lt;/em&gt; it might not get past the brand folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's another render-blocking script in this part of the waterfall. The download starts late because it's at the bottom of the HTML, so it should be moved to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and given the &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the Moto 4 gets &lt;strong&gt;locked up for 3 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see this from the red bar at the bottom of the waterfall. WebPageTest shows little pink lines next to script when they're using main-thread time. If you scroll up to row 19, you can see it's responsible for a lot of this jank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall.599d2ae810d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the second load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-film-2.99c7e358c7bc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mercedes-waterfall-2.3d50abf249e7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the HTML, none of the resources have &lt;code&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/code&gt; headers. But browser heuristics step in, and as a result the cache is used for most assets anyway. This is kinda cheating, and unlikely to reflect reality, but hey, I can't change the rules now. For a refresher on caching, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/&quot;&gt;check out my article on best practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of caching headers seems like an oversight, because a lot of the assets seem to have version numbers. Most of the work has been done, it just lacks a little server configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite the heuristic caching, it still takes &lt;strong&gt;5.8s to get into a useable state&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is all down to JavaScript execution. The fixes I mentioned above would cover this too. Apply code splitting, and allow rendering before JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've done a pretty good job of image compression here. They appear to be using some JavaScript to load smaller versions of images for mobile devices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2015/anatomy-of-responsive-images/&quot;&gt;You don't need JavaScript for this&lt;/a&gt;. Using JS for this delays image loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; I could get the first image down &lt;strong&gt;from 50k to 29k&lt;/strong&gt; without significant loss. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/mercedes.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt; and judge for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Mercedes storm into 1st place and last place at the same time, as often happens with the first result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Gzip, except TTF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; No cache control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Badly compressed fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gut feeling is the quick-wins (preloading, compressing fonts) would half this time. I imagine the refactoring of the JS and CSS would be a much bigger task, but would bring big results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ferrari&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari also make cars. You might have seen one on a road, driven by a wanker (except my friend Matt who bucks this trend. Hi Matt!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a new driver this year, and a slightly different livery, so this site may have been changed fairly recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://formula1.ferrari.com/en/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190318_5P_f9b7d391cfda6d0228cda70d469e46ba/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_1&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-film.ccb598a9df15.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience there's &lt;strong&gt;33s of nothing&lt;/strong&gt;, some content at 34.3s, but things move around until 36s. This is around twice as long as Mercedes, so things aren't looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-waterfall.c0cf7272a5fc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow that's a lot of requests! But, Ferrari use HTTP/2, so it isn't such a big deal. I should mention, this article is a real workout for your scrolling finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stand-out issue is that huge row 16. It's a &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking script&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-waterfall.c0cf7272a5fc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also on another server, so it &lt;strong&gt;needs to set up a new HTTP connection&lt;/strong&gt;, which takes time. You can see this in the waterfall by the thinner green/orange/purple line which signifies the various stages of setting up a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest issue with that script, is &lt;strong&gt;it's 1.8mb&lt;/strong&gt;. There's also an additional 150k script that isn't minified, and other scripts which sit on different servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;CSS is 66k and 90% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so this could benefit from splitting. There are a few fonts that would benefit from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but they're pretty small. Let's face it, everything is small compared to the JS. Oddly, Chrome's coverage tool claims 90% of the JS is used on page load, which beggars belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/code-coverage-ferrari.0e45be6f1055.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dug into their JavaScript and saw a lot of locale data in there, which should be split out, but then I saw a large chunk of base64. You'll never guess what it is. It's this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-banner.8084cc09e5c3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, not the whole thing. The logo. No, not the whole logo, that's SVG. But the horse, the horse is a base64 PNG within the SVG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/horse-composite.87fb650d6d91.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at it. It's beautiful. &lt;strong&gt;It's 2300x2300. It's 1.7mb.&lt;/strong&gt; 90% of their performance problem is a &lt;em&gt;massive bloody horse&lt;/em&gt;. That logo appears across the main Ferrari site too, so it's probably something the creator of the F1 site had little control over. I wonder if they knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there seems to be server rendering going on, but it's rendered useless by the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be multiple versions of the same image downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_1&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-film-2.d6af2ec4062a.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/ferrari-waterfall-2.0ff94a081b4b.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site has ok caching headers, so I'm surprised to see the browser revalidating some of those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem here is still the JS, which takes up two seconds of main thread time. The main-thread then gets &lt;strong&gt;locked up until 10.1s&lt;/strong&gt;. This isn't by JavaScript. I'm not 100% sure what it is, but I suspect it's image-decoding that horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_1&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's tackle that logo. SVG might be the best format for this, but with the bitmap-horse replaced with a much simpler vector-horse (Vector Horse's debut album is OUT NOW). However, I don't have a vector version of the horse, so I'll stick with a bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo is only ever displayed really-tiny in the top-left, at a height of 20px. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt;, I'm going to make a 60px version so it stays sharp on high-density devices. &lt;strong&gt;That takes the image from 1.7mb, to a 2.6k PNG, or a 1.7k WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/ferrari.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the initial images on the site is of the 2019 Ferrari. However, it's 1620px wide, and not really optimised for mobile. I took the image down &lt;strong&gt;from 134k to 23k as JPEG, or 16k as WebP&lt;/strong&gt; without significant loss. But, &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/ferrari.html#car&quot;&gt;you can be the judge&lt;/a&gt;. WebP shines here because JPEG struggles with smooth gradients – at lower sizes it creates banding which is really noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page also contains little track maps that aren't initially displayed. These should be lazy-loaded, but they could also do with a bit of compression. I was able to get one of them down &lt;strong&gt;from 145k to 27k&lt;/strong&gt; as a PNG without noticeable loss. Again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/ferrari.html#track&quot;&gt;you be the judge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_1&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last place for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of their problem is down to one horse. I don't think anyone did that deliberately, but RUM &amp;amp; build time metrics would have made it obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unminified scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unstable render&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Poor image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Horse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;red-bull&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Bull aren't a car company. They sell drinks of a flavour I can only describe as &quot;stinky medicine&quot;. But, they're also a much more modern, tech-savvy company, so it'll be interesting to see if it shows here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redbullracing.redbull.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190315_C3_a4713be271d850097990ca69423bfc4c/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_2&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/redbull-film.321931393942.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user experience is 4.9s of nothing, but the result is a broken UI. Things sort themselves out at around 6.5s. There's a font switch at 9.5s, and a horrendous cookie warning at 16s. But, I'd call this visually ready at 6.5s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/redbull-waterfall.7ca2a31b21b3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we can't call this page ready at 6.5s, as the main thread is &lt;strong&gt;locked up until 11s&lt;/strong&gt;. Still, this takes it into 1st place by a couple of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story here is very similar to the previous sites. The page contains what looks like a server render, including minified HTML, but &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt; prevent it being shown. The scripts should use &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CSS is 90% unused, and the JS is ~75% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so code-splitting and including only what's needed for this page would have a huge benefit. This might help with the main thread lock-ups too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/redbull-waterfall.7ca2a31b21b3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the &lt;strong&gt;fonts start loading way too late&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be a quick win here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icon font times-out, which causes a broken render. There isn't really a good reason to use icon fonts these days. Icon fonts should be replaced with SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site does use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but it's mostly used for JS and CSS, which don't really need preloading as they're already in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Worse, they preload a different version of the scripts to the ones they use on the page, so they're &lt;strong&gt;doubling the download&lt;/strong&gt;. Chrome's console shows a warning about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/console-warning.a538392d8c70.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_2&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/redbull-film-2.d64575ce2c73.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/redbull-waterfall-2.c519f57abb4a.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to decent caching, we get a render really quickly. However, &lt;strong&gt;JS bogs down the main thread&lt;/strong&gt; for many seconds afterwards, so the page isn't really interactive until the 4.8s mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the JavaScript would be chunked up so it only hits the main thead during idle time, or just as the user needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_2&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Mercedes, Red Bull uses responsive images, but use JavaScript to make it work. Still, this is better than serving full size images to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images could be smaller though. Taking the first image on their page, Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; I can take it down &lt;strong&gt;from 91k to 36k as a JPEG, or 22k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/redbull.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also use a spritesheet, which might not be necessary thanks to HTTP/2. By bringing the palette down to 256 colours, I can take it down &lt;strong&gt;from 54k to 23k as PNG, or 18k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/redbull.html#sprites&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_2&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite issues, Red Bull are straight into 1st place by almost 4 seconds. Nice work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Minification, including HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary icon fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;renault&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to folks that make cars. Car adverts tend to be awful, but I reckon Renault make the worst ones. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7wSxA1P4XM&quot;&gt;they may have spent too much money on one of their drivers&lt;/a&gt; and not have enough left over for their website. Let's see…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renaultsport.com/-Formule-1-330-.html&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190315_5N_e5c1d85d3f7dd0701b96359352761388/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_3&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-film.5c74b59ee29e.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user gets 5.8s of nothing, then a broken render until 7.8s, but the &lt;strong&gt;intended content of the page doesn't arrive until 26.5s.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, asking for notification permission on load should be a black flag situation, but I'll be kind and ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-waterfall.fab34e53cb75.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with previous sites, &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt; account for the first 5.8s of nothing. These should use &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;. However, this script doesn't get the page into an interactive state, it delivers a broken render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, something interesting happens. The scripts that are needed to set up the page are at the bottom of the HTML, so the browser gives these &lt;strong&gt;important scripts a low priority&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-waterfall.fab34e53cb75.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see from the waterfall that the browser starts the download kinda late, but not that late. The darker area of the bars indicates the resource is actively downloading, but in this case the scripts are left waiting until other things such as images download. To fix this, these important scripts should be in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The page should be fixed so the before-JS render is usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CSS is 85% unused, and the JS is ~55% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so it would benefit from splitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-waterfall.fab34e53cb75.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the other pages the &lt;strong&gt;fonts load late&lt;/strong&gt;. It's especially bad here as images steal all the bandwidth (more on that in a second). Preloading fonts is a huge &amp;amp; quick win, and icon fonts should be replaced with SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_3&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-film-2.513909d209d6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/renault-waterfall-2.9c4c19ccc571.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caching is pretty good here, but a few &lt;strong&gt;uncached scripts&lt;/strong&gt; push the complete render back to 5.9s. The first lap fixes would help here, along with some &lt;code&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/code&gt; headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_3&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images play quite a big part in the performance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took their first carousel image and put it through &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt;. This took the size from &lt;strong&gt;314k down to 59k as a JPEG, or 31k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't think the compression is too noticeable, especially as text will be rendered over the top. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/renault.html&quot;&gt;Judge for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their driver pictures are PNGs, which is a bad choice for photo data. I can get one of them &lt;strong&gt;from 1mb down to 21k&lt;/strong&gt; as a JPEG. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/renault.html#driver&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_3&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The download priority of those important scripts hits hard here, and the images still all the bandwidth. These things can be easily fixed, but are slowing the site down by 15+ seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unstable render&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary icon fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;haas&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haas are the newest team in F1 (unless you count rebrands), so their website should be pretty new. They've kept their drivers from last year, despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoLrLqqAGbI&quot;&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; managing to crash at slow speeds for no reason, and blame another driver who wasn't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their car looks pretty different this year with the arrival of a new sponsor, Rich Energy. Y'know, Rich Energy. The drink. You must have heard of it. Rich Energy. It's definitely not some sort of scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haasf1team.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190315_P4_156ead72882bf25ec72bfb152d174fc0/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_4&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/haas-film.349bfbbbadc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user gets &lt;strong&gt;4.5s of nothing&lt;/strong&gt;, and then it's interactive! Pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a long time for that first image to show, but hey, it doesn't block interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/haas-waterfall.59eecb908aa2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It terms of improvements, it's a similar story. There's a server render, but it's blocked by &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These come from a couple of different servers, so they pay the price of &lt;strong&gt;additional HTTP connections&lt;/strong&gt;. But, the amount of script blocking render is much smaller than other sites we've looked at so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;a fraction of the JS and CSS is used&lt;/strong&gt;, so splitting those up would really improve things. The main &lt;strong&gt;CSS isn't minified&lt;/strong&gt; which hurts load time slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;strong&gt;font preloading would help&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_4&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/haas-film-2.2b2ac8af69c3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/haas-waterfall-2.de08e13e9380.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good caching setup reduces the amount of network traffic. However a combination of image decoding, JavaScript, and layout hits hard, &lt;strong&gt;locking up the main thread&lt;/strong&gt; until the 8 second mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their second load is slower than their first. Because their overall load time for the first load is network-limited, things like image decoding and script execution happen gradually. In this case, it all lands at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_4&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren't great here. The first couple of carousel images are &lt;strong&gt;3mb each&lt;/strong&gt;, and look like they came straight off a digital camera. I guess they were uploaded via a CMS which doesn't recompress the images for the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; (have I mentioned Squoosh yet?), I can take those thumbnails &lt;strong&gt;from 3mb to around 56k as a JPEG, and 44k as WebP&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/haas.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_4&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite problems, they jump into 1st place! However, it feels like it could be a lot faster by solving some of the main-thread issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;mclaren&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLaren do sell the occasional car, but they're a racing team through and through. Although, in recent years, they've been a pretty slow racing team, and as a result they've lost their star driver. But will the website reflect the problems they're having on track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mclaren.com/formula1/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190316_1P_abeb79b44af2270a27d774f3a5da939d/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_5&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-film.b2750561aca2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience, the user gets nothing for the first 10.6 seconds, but the &lt;strong&gt;content jumps around until 24.3 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-waterfall.80c912d66bfd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first problem we see in the waterfall is the amount of &lt;strong&gt;additional connections needed&lt;/strong&gt;. Their content is spread across many servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-waterfall.80c912d66bfd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;main CSS is 81k, but 90% unused&lt;/strong&gt; for the initial render. Ideally the stuff needed for first render would be inlined, and the rest lazy-loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-waterfall.80c912d66bfd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's a request for some fonts CSS (row 6). It's on yet another server, so we get another connection, and it &lt;strong&gt;serves a redirect&lt;/strong&gt; to yet another server (row 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSS it eventually serves is &lt;strong&gt;137k and uncompressed&lt;/strong&gt;, and is mostly base64 encoded font data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest thing blocking first render. It's bad enough when text rendering is blocked on font loading, but in this case the whole page is blocked. Ideally, required fonts should be served as their own cachable resources, and preloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get their JS bundle, which is &lt;strong&gt;67% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so could benefit from some code splitting. It's also located at the bottom of the HTML, so it'd benefit from being in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;. This would make it start downloading much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get a request for 'jsrender', which seems to be the framework this site uses. This sits on yet another server, so they pay the price of yet another connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content that appears at 24s is included as JSON within the HTML, and it isn't clear why it takes so long to render. Their main script uses a lot of main thread time, so maybe it's just taking ages to process all the template data, and isn't giving priority to the stuff that needs to appear at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first site so far that serves its content in JavaScript rather than HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_5&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-film-2.8620c683562f.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/mclaren-waterfall-2.1eaaf194e316.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caching headers are mostly absent, but browser heuristics make it look better than it is. The number of connections needed still hits hard, as does the JS processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content &lt;strong&gt;doesn't appear until 16.4s&lt;/strong&gt;, and it's worth noting that the main thread is still really busy at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_5&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a 286k spritesheet which needs breaking up, and perhaps replaced with SVG. Usually I would try to reduce the palette on something like this, but it loses too much detail. Anyway, I can get it down &lt;strong&gt;from 286k to 238k as a PNG, and 145k as WebP&lt;/strong&gt; without any loss at all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/mclaren.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They avoid downloading large images until the user scrolls, which is nice. Taking one of the images that arrives, I can get it &lt;strong&gt;down from 373k to 59k as a JPEG and 48k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/mclaren.html#photo&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_5&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;40.7s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not back-of-the-grid, but close. To be competitive, this site needs proper caching, fewer connections, and a decent before-JavaScript render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Lazy-loading images&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unstable render&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Too many HTTP connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;racing-point&quot;&gt;Racing Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lance Stroll wanted to be a racing driver, so daddy bought him an entire F1 team. That team is called Racing Point because I dunno maybe they were trying to pick the dullest name possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racingpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190316_XS_121a1e8cd67fe1f62fe0e1e45883fe03/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_6&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-film.cb39746ead38.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user gets nothing for 45s, but the intended top-of-page content &lt;strong&gt;isn't ready until the 70s mark&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-waterfall.a700cf93a631.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the main thread is &lt;strong&gt;too busy for interaction until 76s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page starts by downloading &lt;strong&gt;300k of CSS that's served without minification, and without gzip&lt;/strong&gt;. Minifying and gzipping would be a quick win here, but with &lt;strong&gt;over 90% of the CSS unused&lt;/strong&gt;, it'd be better to split it up and serve just what this page needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-waterfall.a700cf93a631.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, this CSS imports more CSS, from Google Fonts, so it pays the cost of &lt;strong&gt;another connection&lt;/strong&gt;. But the main problem is the browser doesn't know it needs the fonts CSS until the main CSS downloads, and by that time there's a lot of stuff &lt;strong&gt;fighting for bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-waterfall.a700cf93a631.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be a huge and quick win here, to get that CSS downloading much earlier. It's the CSS that's currently blocking first render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also suffers from &lt;strong&gt;late-loading scripts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-waterfall.a700cf93a631.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scripts are at the bottom of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so they don't block rendering. However, if this JS is going to pop-in content at the top of the page, that space should be reserved so it doesn't move content around. Ideally a server-render of the carousel's first frame should be provided, which the JS can enhance. Also, these scripts should be in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; so they start downloading earlier. Like the CSS, they &lt;strong&gt;lack minification and gzipping&lt;/strong&gt;, which are quick wins. The &lt;strong&gt;JS is also 64% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so could be split up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carousel JS waits until the images (or at least the first image) has downloaded before displaying the carousel. Unfortunately the &lt;strong&gt;first image is 3mb&lt;/strong&gt;. There's also a &lt;strong&gt;6mb image&lt;/strong&gt; on the page, but that isn't blocking that initial content render. These images need compressed (more on that in a second). The carousel should also avoid waiting on the images, and maybe provide a low resolution version while the full image downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thread is then locked up for a bit. I haven't dug into why, but I suspect it's image decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_6&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-film-2.f7b4bf294850.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/racingpoint-waterfall-2.9f168fd96de4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site has &lt;strong&gt;pretty good caching headers&lt;/strong&gt;, so very little is redownloaded second time around. However, we don't get the main content until 8.2s due to &lt;strong&gt;main thread contention&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a mixture of JavaScript, but mostly (I suspect) image decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_6&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this one, image performance really matters in terms of first render. I got that &lt;strong&gt;3mb image down to 57k as a JPEG, and 39k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; The WebP is noticeably missing detail, but WebP's artefacts are less ugly than JPEG's so we can afford to go lower, especially since this image sits behind content. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/racing-point.html&quot;&gt;You be the judge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, their logo is &lt;strong&gt;117k.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm sure the brand folks would like it to load a bit quicker. By resizing it and reducing colours to 100, I got it &lt;strong&gt;to 13k as a PNG, and 12k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/racing-point.html#logo&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;. An SVG might be even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_6&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;40.7s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Racing Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;84.2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have to scroll a bit to see this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is compression and timing. With image, CSS, JS compression, and some CSS preloading, this score would be &amp;lt; 20s. With a good server render of the carousel, it could be &amp;lt; 10s. Unfortunately it's back-of-the-grid for Racing Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; No render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; No gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; No minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unstable layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Late-loading JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;alfa-romeo&quot;&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa Romeo make cars, but they don't really make the one they race. The engine is a Ferrari, and the aero is the work of Sauber, which was the name of this team before 2019. But, a new brand often come with a new website. Let's see how it performs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sauber-group.com/motorsport/formula-1/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190316_J4_faa55eb9e863ce8c80b1f4f4709501c3/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_7&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-film.24ddddf66ae0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user gets nothing for 7.9s, but they only get &lt;strong&gt;a spinner until 15.6s&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to scroll to get content, but I'll count this as interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-waterfall.a37910bb4ccb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The render is &lt;strong&gt;blocked until the Google Fonts CSS downloads&lt;/strong&gt;, which points to a similar problem as Racing Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-waterfall.a37910bb4ccb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yep, their main CSS (row 2) imports the Google Fonts CSS (row 9). This should be preloaded to allow the two to download in parallel. It's especially bad here, as the font they're downloading is Roboto, which already exists on Android, so no fonts are actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main CSS is pretty small, but still &lt;strong&gt;85% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so splitting and perhaps inlining would help a lot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After parsing the HTML, the browser discovers a load of images it needs to download, then a couple of scripts at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-waterfall.a37910bb4ccb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these scripts are essential to the rendering of the page, so they're &lt;strong&gt;loading far too late&lt;/strong&gt;. A quick win would be to move them to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (they already have &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;). This would save around 8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;JS is also 85% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so splitting would definitely help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page shouldn't need a spinner. Instead, it could have a before-JS render. The page is mostly static, so there aren't too many challenges here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_7&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-film-2.21b9037716d2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/alfa-waterfall-2.cd2dbbca6e0e.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site makes &lt;strong&gt;excellent use of caching&lt;/strong&gt;, but the JS-driven rendering slows things down. The &lt;strong&gt;main thread is jammed&lt;/strong&gt; for a few seconds thanks to a combination of JavaScript and image decoding, getting to render in 4.5s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things which would make the first lap faster would also help here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_7&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image right at the top of the page is &lt;strong&gt;236k&lt;/strong&gt;. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt;, I managed to get this &lt;strong&gt;down to 16k as a JPEG, and 9k as a PNG.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/alfa-romeo.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page also loads a lot of logos. None of them are particularly big themselves, but they add up. I took one example &lt;strong&gt;from 18k down to 7k as a PNG.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/alfa-romeo.html#logo&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of saving across all the logos would be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_7&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;toro-rosso&quot;&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the &quot;stinky medicine&quot; folks again. They fund two 'independent' teams in F1, with this one being a kinda &quot;B team&quot;. But, can they beat their sister team on the web?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/toro-film.6f3b34b95243.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience, the user gets 4.7s of nothing. But, text doesn't start to appear until 5.4s. Then, more text appears gradually, and &lt;strong&gt;seems complete at 5.8s&lt;/strong&gt;. Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/toro-waterfall.d08948e21901.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the main thread is &lt;strong&gt;blocked until 8s&lt;/strong&gt;. This looks like image decoding, but I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very much like the other sites we've seen, they serve HTML but it's blocked by &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. They should use &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;CSS is 90% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;JS is over 50% unused&lt;/strong&gt;. Splitting would help here. There are also late-loading scripts that would benefit from being in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;. There's also some &lt;strong&gt;unminified scripts&lt;/strong&gt; thrown in there too. But, despite this, their JS &amp;amp; CSS isn't too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest performance problem this site has is fonts. That's why the text comes in late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/toro-waterfall.d08948e21901.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fonts are late-loading&lt;/strong&gt;, so preloading them would have a huge benefit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fonts are also a little big. Using &lt;strong&gt;woff2 would be a quick win&lt;/strong&gt; here, but it might be worth considering getting rid of some of the fonts all together. But yeahhhhh that can be a tough argument to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_8&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caching headers are mostly great, except for the &lt;strong&gt;fonts which only cache for 30 seconds.&lt;/strong&gt; That's why we see so many revalidations in the waterfall above. Allowing the fonts to cache for longer would have saved a good few seconds here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_8&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll never guess what. I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; here. Their top image isn't really optimised for mobile. I managed to get it &lt;strong&gt;down from 152k to 26k&lt;/strong&gt; as a JPEG. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/toro-rosso.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;40.7s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Racing Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;84.2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;20.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So close! Only a couple of tenths off Haas. With font preloading and some image compression, they'd easily be in 1st place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;williams&quot;&gt;Williams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams are probably my favouite team. They're relatively small, independent, and have an incredible history. However, their last few seasons have been awful. Hopefully that won't reflect on their website…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.williamsf1.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190316_DQ_f6d91d400454e78f6e00249e4dd5594e/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_9&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-film.e198ce4fd006.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience, the user sees &lt;strong&gt;nothing until 7.9s&lt;/strong&gt;, but then they have visible content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-waterfall.3465725f1e06.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that stands out here is all the additional connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-waterfall.3465725f1e06.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this meant they were using a lot of different servers, but a closer look shows they're &lt;strong&gt;using old HTTP/1&lt;/strong&gt;. This means the browser has to set up separate connections for concurrent downloads. A switch to HTTP/2 would be a big win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look, those fonts are arriving nice and early. A quick look at their source shows they're using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get their CSS, which is fairly small but still &lt;strong&gt;90% unused&lt;/strong&gt;. Splitting and inlining these would show a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-waterfall.3465725f1e06.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we get a few &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt; in the head. These should be &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;d to allow the server render to show before JS loads. The page is pretty much static so this shouldn't be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their main JS loads at the end of the document, and it's a &lt;strong&gt;whopping 430k&lt;/strong&gt;. This page barely needs any JS at all, so I'm pretty sure that can be significantly reduced, if not discarded. Thankfully it doesn't block render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_9&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-film-2.1159ac6362e0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/williams-waterfall-2.e5a210c7b5cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;caching headers are good&lt;/strong&gt;, so very few requests are made on the second run. However, HTTP/1 slows down the initial request, then that massive script arrives from the cache and takes up &lt;strong&gt;1.5s of main thread time&lt;/strong&gt;. In total, it takes 6.2s to render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixes from the first run will also fix these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_9&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look at the main image. It's a wide image, but the sides aren't shown on mobile. Also, it has a dark overlay over the top, which reduces the fidelity of the image. I cropped the image a bit, and applied the overlaid colour to the image, so the compressor could optimise for it. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; (drink!), I got the size &lt;strong&gt;from 267k to 48k as a JPEG, and 34k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; Since text is rendered over the top, it might be reasonable to compress it more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/williams.html&quot;&gt;See the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_9&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;40.7s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Racing Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;84.2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;20.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Williams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;14.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite issues, this is one of the fastest times. With HTTP/2, it might have jumped into 1st place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; Preloading fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Render-blocking scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Image compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Main thread lock-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; Unnecessary JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;fantasy-f1&quot;&gt;Fantasy F1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to throw the official fantasy F1 site into the mix too. It's my blog I can do whatever I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.formula1.com/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190317_HB_adaeac4882b9e2e1201f28ff627a849f/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lap_10&quot;&gt;First lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-film.169058b52d2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of user experience, the user gets nothing until 12s. But the text for the main call-to-action doesn't display until &lt;strong&gt;14.5s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-waterfall.2625f0123166.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;main thread looks blocked&lt;/strong&gt; until at least the 15s mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first site we've seen with a near-empty &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and also the first to use one of the modern frameworks (Ember).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial render is blocked on CSS and &lt;strong&gt;render-blocking scripts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the render is JavaScript driven, the browser doesn't know much about the resources it needs to download until Ember renders the page. That's why we see a load of requests begin around the 9.5s mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-waterfall.2625f0123166.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page would benefit massively from a server render. But, given there isn't really any interactivity on this page, they could consider removing the JS all together, or preloading it for when it is needed. It certainly doesn't need 700k of JS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2017/netflix-and-react/&quot;&gt;Netflix removed React from their landing page&lt;/a&gt; and saw a huge speed boost. The same could be done here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;CSS is 95% unused&lt;/strong&gt;, so it could be split up so this page can use the necessary parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The button text appears late because of &lt;strong&gt;late-loading fonts&lt;/strong&gt;. Which is also excasserbated by the JavaScript-render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-waterfall.2625f0123166.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other pages, this page would benefit hugely from font preloading. Also some of the fonts are TTFs. They're gzipped, but &lt;strong&gt;woff2 would be much smaller&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-lap_10&quot;&gt;Second lap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-film-2.6862f7a6fd82.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/static/posts/f1-perf-audit/fantasy-waterfall-2.84303ef94e81.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JS URLs look versioned, but their &lt;code&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/code&gt; header requires the browser to check for an update every time. You can see that in the 304 responses in the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the scripts have landed, they &lt;strong&gt;lock up the main thread&lt;/strong&gt; until at least the 7s mark. Again, removing JavaScript and making this a mostly static page would improve things massively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images_10&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of images, I took a look at the main background image at the top of the page. The team have clearly tried to make this small, because the JPEG compression is pretty visible. However, it has the same problem as the Williams image – most of it isn't visible on mobile, and it has an overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I baked the overlay into the image, cropped it a bit, and took it down &lt;strong&gt;from 170k down to 54k as a JPEG, and 43k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; It might be possible to go lower, but I was already dealing with an image with a lot of compression artefacts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/fantasy.html&quot;&gt;See the result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a 219k PNG. I think it's a PNG because it has transparency, but it's only ever displayed over a white background. I gave it a solid background, and took it &lt;strong&gt;down to 38k as a JPEG, and 20k as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/fantasy.html#diagram&quot;&gt;See the result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another image caught my eye. There's an image of the Spanish flag as an SVG (29k), which can be optimised via &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/&quot;&gt;SVGOMG&lt;/a&gt; to 15k. However, the Spanish flag is pretty intricate, and displayed really tiny on the site (30x22). I got it &lt;strong&gt;down to 1.2k as a PNG, and 800b as WebP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1-images.glitch.me/fantasy.html#flag&quot;&gt;See the result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although SVG is usually the best choice for logos, sometimes a PNG/WebP is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;result_10&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/2&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's the last site. How do the all compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-results&quot;&gt;Final results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;19.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;46.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;15.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Renault&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;32.4s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Haas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;McLaren&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;40.7s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Racing Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;84.2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;20.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;12.8s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Williams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;14.1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Fantasy F1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;time&quot;&gt;22.0s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the Haas team who cross the finishing line first, and have the fastest website in Formula One. Toro Rosso are really close, and Williams complete the podium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been kinda eye-opening for me. In my job, I feel I spend a lot of time trying to convince users of frameworks to get a meaningful static/server render as part of their build process early on. It has a huge impact on performance, it gives you the option of dropping the client-side part of the framework for particular pages, and it's incredibly hard to add later. However, none of the teams used any of the big modern frameworks. They're mostly Wordpress &amp;amp; Drupal, with a lot of jQuery. It makes me feel like I've been in a bubble in terms of the technologies that make up the bulk of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's great to see HTTPS, HTTP/2, gzip, minification, and decent caching widely used. These are things folks in the performance community have been pushing for a long time, and it seems like it's paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the bits of performance advice we've been pushing the longest is &quot;don't use render-blocking scripts&quot;, yet every site has them. Most of the sites have some sort of server/static render, but the browser can't display it due to these blocking scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every site would massively benefit from font preloading. Although I'm not suprised it's missing from most sites, as preloading hasn't been in browsers as long as other performance primitives. I guess code splitting is newish too, which is why there isn't a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like the quick-wins would cut the times down by 25%, if not more. An unblocked render would bring many down to the 5 second mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues feel like they may have happened after the site was launched. Eg, a too-big image was uploaded, or a massive horse was added to the header. RUM metrics and build reporting would have helped here – developers would have seen performance crashing as the result of a particular change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aren't totally comparable, but this page (which is kinda huge and has a lot of images) would score 4.6s on the same test (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190319_3D_9a8b75faf6747b38417ca081d171baa6/&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://squoosh.app&quot;&gt;Squoosh&lt;/a&gt; would score 4.2s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190316_PA_cec874a40f1428ab7a8ae020a41b6e54/&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;), but we spent a lot of time on performance there. Most of this is down to an unblocked initial render and code splitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, does this mean Haas are going to win the 2019 Formula One season? Probably. I mean, it makes sense right?&lt;/p&gt;
