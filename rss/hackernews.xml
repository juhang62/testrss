<title>SACK Panic – Multiple TCP-based remote denial-of-service issues</title>
<link>https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/tcpsack</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/tcpsack</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three related flaws were found in the Linux kernel’s handling of TCP networking.  The most severe vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to trigger a kernel panic in systems running the affected software and, as a result, impact the system’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues have been assigned multiple CVEs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-11477&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-11477&lt;/a&gt; is considered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/&quot;&gt;Important&lt;/a&gt; severity, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-11478&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-11478&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-11479&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-11479&lt;/a&gt; are considered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/&quot;&gt;Moderate&lt;/a&gt; severity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two are related to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) packets combined with Maximum Segment Size (MSS), the third solely with the Maximum Segment Size (MSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues are corrected either through applying mitigations or kernel patches.  Mitigation details and links to RHSA advsories can be found on the RESOLVE tab of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Issue Details and Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three related flaws were found in the Linux kernel’s handling of TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) packets handling with low MSS size. The extent of impact is understood to be limited to denial of service at this time. No privilege escalation or information leak is currently suspected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mitigations shown in this article are available, they might affect traffic from legitimate sources that require the lower MSS values to transmit correctly and system performance. Please evaluate the mitigation that is appropriate for the system’s environment before applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a selective acknowledgement ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) is a mechanism where the data receiver can inform the sender about all the segments that have successfully been accepted. This allows the sender to retransmit segments of the stream that are missing from its ‘known good’ set. When TCP SACK is disabled a much larger set of retransmits are required to retransmit a complete stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is MSS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum segment size (MSS) is a parameter set in the TCP header of a packet that specifies the total amount of data contained in a reconstructed TCP segment.&lt;br/&gt;As packets might become fragmented when transmitting across different routes, a host must specify the MSS as equal to the largest IP datagram payload size that a host can handle. Very large MSS sizes might mean that a stream of packets ends up fragmented on their way to the destination, whereas smaller packets can ensure less fragmentation but end up with unused overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operating systems and transport types can default to specified MSS sizes. Attackers with privileged access can create raw packets with crafted MSS options in the packet to create this attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TCP SACKs:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP is a connection oriented protocol. When two parties wish to communicate over a TCP connection, they establish a connection by exchanging certain information such as requesting to initiate (SYN) a connection, initial sequence number, acknowledgement number, maximum segment size (MSS) to use over this connection, permission to send and process Selective Acknowledgements(SACKs), etc. This connection establishment process is known as 3-way handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP sends and receives user data by a unit called Segment. A TCP segment consists of TCP Header, Options and user data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TCP Segmentation&quot; data-cke-saved-src=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/sack1.png&quot; src=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/sack1.png&quot;/&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each TCP segment has a Sequence Number (SEQ) and Acknowledgement Number (ACK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These SEQ &amp;amp; ACK numbers are used to track which segments are successfully received by the receiver. ACK number indicates the next expected segment by the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: user ‘A’ above sends 1 kilobytes of data through 13 segments of 100 bytes each, 13 because each segment has TCP header of 20 bytes. On the receiving end, user ‘B’ receives segments 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 - 13, segments 3, 5 and 7 are lost, not received by user ‘B’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using ACK numbers, user ‘B’ will indicate that it is expecting segment number 3, which the user ‘A’ reads as none of the segments after 2 were received by the user ‘B’,and user ‘A’ will retransmit all the segments from 3 onwards, even though segments 4, 6 and 8-13 were successfully received by user ‘B’. User ‘B’ has no way to indicate that to user ‘A’. This leads to an inefficient usage of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Selective Acknowledgement: SACK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome above problem, Selective Acknowledgement(SACK) mechanism was devised and defined by RFC-2018. With Selective Acknowledgement(SACK), user ‘B’ above uses its TCP options field to inform user ‘A’ about all the segments(1,2,4,6,8-13) it has received successfully, so user ‘A’ needs to retransmit only segments 3, 5, and 7, thus considerably saving the network bandwidth and avoiding further congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-11477&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-11477&lt;/a&gt; SACK Panic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Socket Buffers(&lt;a href=&quot;http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html&quot;&gt;SKB&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;Socket Buffer (SKB) is the most central data structure used in the Linux TCP/IP implementation. It is a linked list of buffers, which holds network packets. Such list can act as a Transmission queue, Receive queue, SACK’d queue, Retransmission queue, etc. SKB can hold packet data into fragments. Linux SKB can hold up to 17 fragments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;linux/include/linux/skbuff.h&lt;br/&gt;define MAX_SKB_FRAGS (65536/PAGE_SIZE + 1)  =&amp;gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each fragment holding up to 32KB on x86 (64KB on PowerPC) of data. When packet is due to be sent, it’s placed on the Send queue and it’s details are kept in a control buffer structure like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    linux/include/linux/skbuff.h&lt;br/&gt;struct tcp_skb_cb {&lt;br/&gt;    __u32       seq;                    /* Starting sequence number */&lt;br/&gt;    __u32       end_seq;    /* SEQ + FIN + SYN + datalen */&lt;br/&gt;    __u32       tcp_tw_isn;&lt;br/&gt;        struct {&lt;br/&gt;                u16 tcp_gso_segs;&lt;br/&gt;                u16 tcp_gso_size; &lt;br/&gt;        };&lt;br/&gt;    __u8        tcp_flags;  /2* TCP header flags. (tcp[13])  */&lt;br/&gt;    …&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, ‘&lt;strong&gt;tcp_gso_segs&lt;/strong&gt;’ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;tcp_gso_size&lt;/strong&gt;’ fields are used to tell device driver about segmentation offload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Segmentation offload is on and SACK mechanism is also enabled, due to packet loss and selective retransmission of some packets, SKB could end up holding multiple packets, counted by ‘&lt;strong&gt;tcp_gso_segs&lt;/strong&gt;’. Multiple such SKB in the list are merged together into one to efficiently process different SACK blocks. It involves moving data from one SKB to another in the list. During this movement of data, the SKB structure can reach its maximum limit of 17 fragments and ‘&lt;strong&gt;tcp_gso_segs&lt;/strong&gt;’ parameter can overflow and hit the BUG_ON() call below resulting in the said kernel panic issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;static bool tcp_shifted_skb (struct sock *sk, …, unsigned int pcount, ...)&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;tcp_skb_pcount_add(prev, pcount);&lt;br/&gt;BUG_ON(tcp_skb_pcount(skb) &amp;lt; pcount);   &amp;lt;= SACK panic&lt;br/&gt;tcp_skb_pcount_add(skb, -pcount);&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remote user can trigger this issue by setting the Maximum Segment Size(&lt;strong&gt;MSS&lt;/strong&gt;) of a TCP connection to its lowest limit of 48 bytes and sending a sequence of specially crafted SACK packets. Lowest MSS leaves merely 8 bytes of data per segment, thus increasing the number of TCP segments required to send all data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mathematician Disproves Hedetniemi’s Graph Theory Conjecture</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-disproves-hedetniemis-graph-theory-conjecture-20190617/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-disproves-hedetniemis-graph-theory-conjecture-20190617/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02167&quot;&gt;paper posted online&lt;/a&gt; last month has disproved a 53-year-old conjecture about the best way to assign colors to the nodes of a network. The paper shows, in a mere three pages, that there are better ways to color certain networks than many mathematicians had supposed possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network coloring problems, which were inspired by the question of how to color maps so that adjoining countries are different colors, have been a focus of study among mathematicians for nearly 200 years. The goal is to figure out how to color the nodes of some network (or graph, as mathematicians call them) so that no two connected nodes share the same color. Depending on the context, such a coloring can provide an effective way to seat guests at a wedding, schedule factory tasks for different time slots, or even solve a sudoku puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph coloring problems tend to be simple to state, but they are often enormously hard to solve. Even the question that launched the field — Do four colors suffice to color any map? — took more than a century to answer (the answer is yes, in case you were wondering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem tackled in the new paper seemed, until now, to be no exception to this rule. Unsolved for more than 50 years, it concerns tensor products — graphs made by combining two different graphs (call them &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;) in a specific way. The tensor product of &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; is a new, larger graph in which each node represents a pair of nodes from the original graphs — one from &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and one from &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; — and two nodes in the tensor product are connected if both their corresponding nodes in &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and their corresponding nodes in &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re a music teacher who wants to find good duet pairings for the fifth grade concert. You could make a graph whose nodes are the students, with a link between each pair who get along well. And you could make a second graph in which each node is a different musical instrument, with a link between two instruments if you have sheet music for a duet that features them. The tensor product of these two graphs would have one node for each possible pairing of a student and an instrument (say, Alicia on the trombone), and two nodes will be linked whenever the two students in question work well together and the two instruments are compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~hedet/Stephen_Hedetniemi/Stephen_T._Hedetniemi,_Professor.html&quot;&gt;Stephen Hedetniemi&lt;/a&gt;, now a professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35444301_Homomorphisms_of_graphs_and_automata&quot;&gt;conjectured&lt;/a&gt; in his doctoral dissertation that the minimum number of colors required by a tensor product is the same as the number of colors required by one of its two constituent graphs — whichever of the two numbers is smaller. “It’s a major conjecture in graph theory,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/&quot;&gt;Gil Kalai&lt;/a&gt; of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “Many people tried to think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, mathematicians amassed an array of evidence, some of which pointed to the conjecture being true and some to it being false. Mathematicians had different guesses about which possibility would eventually prevail. But everyone seemed to agree, at least, that the problem was a hard one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I personally thought the conjecture should be true, because a lot of smart people had looked at it and should have found a counterexample” if one existed, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.ryerson.ca/~abonato/&quot;&gt;Anthony Bonato&lt;/a&gt; of Ryerson University in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the Russian mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/61713553&quot;&gt;Yaroslav Shitov&lt;/a&gt; has come up with a simple way to construct such counterexamples: tensor products that require fewer colors than either of their two constituent graphs. The proof is “elementary, but ingenious,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pavol/&quot;&gt;Pavol Hell&lt;/a&gt; of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensor graphs are closely related to questions of how different graphs can be mapped into each other, and in that realm of mathematics, Hedetniemi’s conjecture was perhaps the biggest open problem, Hell said. “It’s an important breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colorful Gatherings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a feel for the kind of information you can glean from coloring a tensor graph, imagine that you plan to invite friends to your country estate over a series of weekends. Like a good host, you want to assemble people who will enjoy each other’s company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that some of your friends have jobs that they can instantly bond over, while others do not. Likewise, you know that each friend has a hobby — another way in which guests might find shared interests. You figure the dance teacher who plays the cello might enjoy talking shop with the yoga instructor who plays tennis, or discussing music with the maple syrup farmer who plays the piano, but might be hard-pressed to slip into conversation with the political scientist who collects stamps. You want each pair of guests at any gathering to be able to find some mutual area of interest, whether through jobs or hobbies, and you’re wondering how many gatherings you need to host before you’ve invited everyone on your guest list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could represent the relationships between different jobs with a graph whose nodes are the jobs, with links connecting any two jobs that are not conducive to shared shop talk. (This might feel backward, but connecting these nodes makes sense in the context of graph coloring, since we’ll ultimately use the colors to separate these problematic pairings.) Likewise, you could make a graph whose nodes are the different hobbies and connect two hobbies whenever they are incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tensor product of these two graphs will have a node for each job-hobby pairing, and two nodes are connected if the two jobs and the two hobbies are both incompatible — exactly the situation you want to avoid at your weekend retreats. Now, if you can color the nodes of the tensor product so that connected nodes are different colors, that will give you a way to form guest lists for different weekends: You can invite the people corresponding to the green nodes on the “green” weekend, the red nodes on the “red” weekend, and so forth, with the assurance that incompatible guests will visit on different weekends. The number of colors you used tells you how many weekends to block off in your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to notice from this example is that any valid coloring of the job graph carries over to the tensor product — you can simply color each job-hobby combo the same color you used for its job. Such a coloring results in gatherings in which each pair of guests is compatible based purely on their shared professional interests, regardless of their hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, any valid coloring for the hobby graph will carry over to the tensor product. Hedetniemi conjectured that whichever of the two carry-over colorings uses fewer colors is, in fact, the best possible way to color the tensor graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, Hedetniemi’s conjecture seems improbable. After all, if you base your tensor coloring on a coloring of the job graph, you’re ignoring everything you know about your friends’ compatible hobbies, and potentially separating guests who would have gotten along just fine. If, instead, you combined all your information about jobs and hobbies, maybe you could get away with using fewer colors and enjoy some well-earned guest-free weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet for more than 50 years, mathematicians could not find a single tensor product that needed fewer colors than one of its two constituent graphs. The conjecture is true, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02579374&quot;&gt;they were able to show&lt;/a&gt;, whenever one of the two constituent graphs requires four or fewer colors. And it is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669811000552&quot;&gt;true in the broader setting of “fractional” colorings&lt;/a&gt;, in which each node can be assigned a combination of colors — maybe 2/3 yellow and 1/3 green. (In terms of weekend house parties, this might correspond to having three different journalist friends who play tennis and inviting two of them on the “yellow” weekend and the third on the “green” weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings hinted that the conjecture might be true, but other findings suggested the opposite. Mathematicians have shown, for example, that Hedetniemi’s conjecture falls apart for &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02579376&quot;&gt;graphs that require an infinite number of colors&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009589568180024X?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;directed graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which each link has a preferred direction. But even as mathematicians proved Hedetniemi’s conjecture in some broader contexts and disproved it in others, they couldn’t seem to resolve it in the setting Hedetniemi originally considered: finite, undirected graphs with non-fractional colorings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The general belief was that it’s likely to be true, but that it’s very hard, one way or another,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nalon/&quot;&gt;Noga Alon&lt;/a&gt; of Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coloring Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shitov has now sliced through these uncertainties with a crisp, simple demonstration that Hedetniemi’s conjecture is false. In a paper whose main argument boils down to just over one page of dense mathematics, he shows how to construct a type of tensor product that requires fewer colors than either of its constituent graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shitov starts by considering what happens when you combine a graph &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; with one of its “exponential” graphs to form a tensor product. An exponential graph has one node for each possible coloring of &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; with some fixed number of colors (here, we’re allowing every possible coloring, not just colorings in which connected nodes are different colors). If the graph &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; has, say, seven nodes and our palette has five colors, then the exponential graph has 5&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; nodes — hence the name “exponential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning our attention to colorings in which connected nodes are supposed to be different colors, we have no guarantee that the five colors in our palette will be sufficient to color the graph &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;; likewise, they might not be enough to color the 5&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-node exponential graph. But mathematicians have long known that there is one graph that these five colors are sufficient to color: the tensor product made from &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and its exponential graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All exponential graphs, in fact, have this property: The tensor product that combines the exponential graph with the graph it was built from can be colored with exactly the same number of colors as in the original palette used to make the exponential graph. Shitov disproved Hedetniemi’s conjecture by showing how to build a graph &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; such that both &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; and its exponential graph require more colors than are in that palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedetniemi has declared himself “absolutely delighted” to have his conjecture resolved after so many decades. Shitov’s proof “has a certain elegance, simplicity and definitive quality to it,” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new counterexample is clever and inventive, mathematicians say, and it doesn’t require any complex, cutting-edge mathematical tools. “To a graph theorist, you can explain the construction in two sentences,” Kalai said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why such an argument was overlooked for more than 50 years is a mystery to mathematicians. “Sometimes, a little gem is covered by leaves,” Hell said. “[Shitov] just managed to understand it more deeply than anybody else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shitov’s graphs are gargantuan: While he has not calculated precisely how large they are, he estimates that the graph &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; probably has at least 4&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; nodes, and the exponential graph at least 4&lt;sup&gt;10000&lt;/sup&gt; nodes — a number vastly larger than the estimated number of particles in the observable universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, “gargantuan” is in the eye of the beholder. To Shitov, his counterexample is “not extremely huge,” he said. “There are counterexamples in mathematics [compared to] which this is a really tiny thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you’re unlikely to invite 4&lt;sup&gt;10000&lt;/sup&gt; guests to your country home, Shitov’s work doesn’t rule out the existence of much smaller counterexamples. Now that mathematicians know Hedetniemi’s conjecture is false, the natural next question is just how false it is: how many fewer colors a tensor product might require than its constituent graphs do, and how few nodes and links such counterexamples can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new paper contains an important lesson for mathematicians, Alon said. “Sometimes, the reason that a conjecture is very hard to prove is simply that it is false.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In Malaysia, which last year became the world’s top destination for discarded plastic, officials have closed down 150 unlicensed waste importers. The government announced in May that it would send back more than 3,000 tons of contaminated plastic waste to countries including the U.S., Canada, Britain and Australia, although details of the shipments — including who will foot the bill — have not been worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SIM swap horror story: I&amp;#039;ve lost decades of data and Google won&amp;#039;t help</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/sim-swap-horror-story-ive-lost-decades-of-data-and-google-wont-lift-a-finger/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/sim-swap-horror-story-ive-lost-decades-of-data-and-google-wont-lift-a-finger/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At 11:30 pm on Monday, 10 June, my oldest daughter shook my shoulder to wake me up from a deep sleep. She said that it appeared my Twitter account had been hacked. It turns out that things were much worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After rolling out of bed, I picked up my Apple iPhone XS and saw a text message that read, &quot;T-Mobile alert: The SIM card for xxx-xxx-xxxx has been changed. If this change is not authorized, call 611.&quot; Well, seeing as how T-Mobile took away my cell service, I could not call 611 for help so that is a worthless message. Thankfully, at the time I still had a Google Fi SIM in a Pixel 3 XL so I called T-Mobile and told them my physical SIM is still in my iPhone and I did NOT authorize any change to my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wave of SIM swapping attacks hit US cryptocurrency users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to get T-Mobile to assign my phone number and service back to my phone by giving them the SIM card ID number and then having them send a text to one of the other four phone numbers in my account where I then read back the verification code. I asked why they would allow someone to call up and take my SIM without my approval. The representative said they can't discriminate or tell who is who over the phone and as long as some key information was given then a swap could be authorized. All seemed fine with T-Mobile at that time, but I still had to go find out what was up with Twitter and later Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitter woes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using Twitter in 2006 to coordinate meetings with other mobile tech writers and as of last week I had nearly 10,000 followers with Twitter verification. My Twitter user ID is number 2,821 and I posted about 30,000 Tweets over the last 13 years. As of right now, that has all been stripped away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Twitter meant quite a bit to me, primarily for my mobile tech writing and the friendships I've developed through Twitter over the years, I made sure to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled with this service. It turns out that the 2FA with text messaging sent to a cell phone may be useless when hackers steal your SIM right out from under you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/two-factor-authentication-cheat-sheet/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-factor authentication: A cheat sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;TechRepublic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a form for you to fill out if your account has been stolen, but it requires your email address assigned to that Twitter account to work. Even when I regained my cell phone, sending a code to that number still won't let me get access to Twitter. I'm stuck in a circle of hell with Twitter and Google right now and Twitter support won't work with me via any other means to resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Twitter is a free service, I would still expect some level of assistance for someone who has had the same account for 13 years and can get thousands of people to verify my identity. If I cannot get my Twitter account back, stay tuned for a new account that I will have to rebuild from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google woes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Twitter wasn't going to work with me until I had my Google account back, I went in to try to reset my Google services password. It turns out that the hacker was a few hours ahead of me and had already changed most of the verification fields I had set up to reset my password. If you have a Google account then I recommend you go into your settings and establish the following in case you need to reset your password on a stolen account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone number for text code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8-digit backup code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other phone number associated with your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email for recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Month and year when you started using Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had some of this information, but the hacker changed everything in the list above except for one email address that was still controlled by me. I used this email to fill out the form for Google every day over the past week, adding in lots of other details about the situation, but have not yet been able to get Google to move forward with recovering my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, a message appeared on my Pixel 3 XL that my Google Fi SIM card had been deactivated. I've been using Google Fi for a few years and lately have been enjoying a $200 service credit after buying my wife's Google Pixel 3. There is actually a number for Google Fi representatives, but repeated calls to them reveal nothing can be done without access to my Gmail account. My longtime Google Fi number and service credit may now be gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-googles-project-fi-cellular-service-with-any-smartphone/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use Google's Project Fi cellular service with any smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;TechRepublic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I've been naive, but I had backed up a ton of personal information on Google Drive. This included tax returns, account passwords for my wife in case I died, personal documents and spreadsheets, and just about everything I had paper copies of at home. Since I change computers, share data with others, and wanted backups in case my house burned down, I trusted cloud services to store my data. I have to admit I am a bit freaked out at the moment and may be moving this data to external hard drives and paper once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pay for Google Drive, Google Fi, and Google Play Movies so I was hoping there would be some level of customer service for paying customers. There are no phone numbers available for customers who pay for services or those who only use free services. Google prides itself on collecting my information and using it to help with search results. Thus, it has all sorts of information on how I conduct my daily life, including tracking my every movement, tracking my business trips, seeing who I contact daily, and much more. You would think it would be smart enough to see when some stranger appears and completely changes my account information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Gmail, my Google account has now been deleted so I'm no longer trying to just reset the password, but instead I am trying to recover my account. I have countless PR folks, friends, family, and others who are in my long Gmail history and am currently unable to access any of that information. I also have thousands of photos that may be lost forever if Google won't work with me to get my account back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any information on how I can get Google to honestly verify my identification and recover my deleted account, I would greatly appreciate you leaving a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;$25,000 for Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I had 2FA enabled for my bank account and the bank account info on Google Drive, it was just a matter of time before the thief started stealing my money. While my wife was concerned about my lost Twitter and Google account, it wasn't until the criminal used my bank account to purchase $25,000 in Bitcoin that she went ballistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bank initially took the money out of my accounts so we called and told them it was fraud. We were told the bank would investigate, but our accounts could be locked for up to 45 days. Thus, we immediately had everyone in the family run down to the ATM to get the maximum amount of cash out so that bills could be paid. We also had to call all of the new graduates we gave checks to for gifts to not cash them yet. It was an extremely stressful week and the adventure isn't over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/bitcoin-blues-this-is-how-much-cyptocurrency-was-stolen-last-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin blues: This is how much cyptocurrency was stolen last year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of days, our bank reversed the $25,000 charge and told us that the fraud department caught the ACH withdrawal before it was fully processed so that neither my family nor the bank lost this money forever. My first instinct was to then change my bank account numbers, but then I realized that every person and company I wrote a check to over the past couple of decades has this same information so I am trusting the bank to protect my assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;T-Mobile woes and success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My T-Mobile SIM was first stolen on Monday, 10 June, and then I was able to get the company to give it back to me that evening. I headed out on a business trip, actually the Garmin Fitness Retreat, in Whitefish, Montana, on Tuesday, 11 June. While I enjoyed dinner with the group on Tuesday evening after I arrived in Montana, I was stressed out the next morning as so much was unknown about my Google account. Thankfully, the kind Garmin representative was sympathetic to my plight and took me to the town so I could obtain a T-Mobile connection and try to lock down everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived in the middle of Whitefish, but for some reason I still had no T-Mobile cellular service. I toggled airplane mode on and off, without success. This was also when I discovered that the hacker had shut off my Google Fi service so I had no ability to call T-Mobile to find out what was going on. I found a local Safeway store with free Wi-Fi and then contacted my wife via Facebook Messenger. Through all of these hacks, it was interesting to find that Facebook was the one reliable and secure service under my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Read More&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While connected to my wife via Facebook Messenger, she contacted T-Mobile on my daughter's cell phone while at home. T-Mobile then confirmed that it had once again taken away my SIM and gave it to someone else. I became enraged while hearing this and told them that my same SIM was still in my iPhone XS and that I wanted T-Mobile to stop giving it away and leave it associated with the physical SIM in my phone. I was told that this request was not possible, but that notes could be added to my account. While I had a PIN associated with my SIM, I still do not know how the thief was able to get past this the first time, I changed this PIN on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I have a good friend at T-Mobile who was very concerned with my plight and was able to get someone to contact me to indeed enable a requirement that my SIM could not be changed unless someone went into the store with at least one means of physical identification. Since that requirement was attached to my account, my T-Mobile service has remained under my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lost services?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my Google account was tied to a number of services, including Google Chrome and I had saved hundreds of account passwords in Chrome that the criminal now had possession of. The first evening I immediately changed the email and password for all accounts related to financial data. Over the next several days I went through and changed every other account I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-asks-fcc-for-permission-to-lock-down-phones/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon wants to lock down phones to protect consumers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CNET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handy tip that has served me well, related to my role as a mobile tech reviewer, was to start one of my review phones and leave it in airplane mode. I then went into Chrome on the phone to view all of the sites where I had accounts and passwords saved. The thief could potentially hijack all of these so I have been meticulously going through them over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some services and websites will not allow me to change my password or email associated with the service without having access to my Gmail account that I used to sign up for these services. Thus, I currently have no access to services like Redbox and Movies Anywhere, in addition to Twitter and Google, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations for your security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to contacting T-Mobile, Google (useless), and Twitter (useless), I took and recommend you take the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;File a police report with your local authorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on a credit freeze and fraud alert with the three credit reporting bureaus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out a report with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your financial institutions know of the possible identity theft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the email and passwords for all accounts that may be connected with the stolen account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using an email and password for logging into accounts rather than simply relying on Facebook, Google, or Twitter as your global login for services. If one service gets stolen, you could bring everything down like I did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using password manager software or letting your device, like an iPhone, help you create extremely long and complicated passwords. I'm exploring some of these tools now to increase the level of security on all of my accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close out old accounts that you never use. Going through my saved Chrome data I found many accounts and services I no longer use, but they are still all subject to damage by the hacker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While two-factor authentication is a minimal standard, look for options beyond having a text message sent for verification. If you get your SIM stolen like I did, 2FA is worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also see:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself against a SIM swap attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;via WIRED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been considering changing my bank account number, social security number, and other accounts that are critical to living and working in the US. I am also freaked out about using cloud services so my strategy at the moment is to only use OneDrive for photo backup while writing my passwords down on paper and leaving everything else off the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has tips on how I might get my Google and Twitter accounts back, I would greatly appreciate the feedback. Also, if you have other tips for what to do before and after a security breach, I would love to hear more in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Carnival Cruises emits ten times more sulphur oxide than all of Europe’s cars</title>
<link>https://ecohustler.com/article/one-corporation-to-pollute-them-all/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ecohustler.com/article/one-corporation-to-pollute-them-all/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruise giant - Carnival Corporation - emits 10 times more air pollution than all of Europe’s cars – study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;104.29032258065&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/06/16/carnival_4_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All photos by Greg English ©&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecohustler.com/article/protesters-disrupt-top-corporate-polluter-carnival-corporation's-agm-in-london/&quot;&gt;Ecohustler disrupted Carnival Cruise's AGM&lt;/a&gt; calling on the shareholders to reduce their company's pollution using straight forward and affordable methods - like burning cleaner fuel. Since then, a new report outlines the corporation's impact on the coastline of Europe. These vast floating cities are burning dirty bunker fuel and creating shocking levels of air pollution wherever they go. Shipping has been an unregulated industry for too long and action is urgently required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/06/16/AirPollution-Carnival.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnival Corporation, the world’s largest luxury cruise operator, emitted nearly 10 times more sulphur oxide (SOx) around European coasts than did all 260 million European cars in 2017, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0b72b745a8222140f6076e08b&amp;amp;id=d97c2a7644&amp;amp;e=09ea9d37b5&quot;&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; by sustainable transport group Transport &amp;amp; Environment reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world’s second largest, is second, yet four times worse than the European car fleet. SOx emissions form sulphate (SO4) aerosols that increase human health risks and contribute to acidification in terrestrial and aquatic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/06/16/Screenshot_2019-06-16_at_10.19.40.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In absolute terms, Spain, Italy and Greece, closely followed by France and Norway, are the European countries most exposed to SOx air pollution from cruise vessels while Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca and Venice are the most impacted European port cities, followed by Civitavecchia (Rome) and Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These countries are so exposed because they are major tourist destinations, but also because they have less stringent marine sulphur fuel standards which allows cruise ships to burn the dirtiest most sulphurous fuel all along their coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/06/16/carnival_agm_1_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faig Abbasov, shipping policy manager at T&amp;amp;E, said: “Luxury cruise ships are floating cities powered by some of the dirtiest fuel possible. Cities are rightly banning dirty diesel cars but they’re giving a free pass to cruise companies that spew out toxic fumes that do immeasurable harm both to those on board and on nearby shores. This is unacceptable.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOX emissions from cruise ships in Europe also heavily impact some cities, equivalent to about 15% of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by Europe’s passenger car fleet in a year, the report finds. In Marseille, for example, 57 cruise ships emitted in 2017 almost as much NOx as one-quarter of the city’s 340,000 passenger cars. Along the coasts of countries such as Norway, Denmark, Greece, Croatia and Malta a handful of cruise ships are also responsible for more NOx than the majority of their domestic car fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe should implement a zero-emission port standard as soon as possible, this could then be extended to other ship types. The report also recommends extending emission control areas (ECAs), currently in place only in the North and Baltic Seas and English Channel, to the rest of the European seas. Furthermore, the report recommends regulating NOx emissions from existing ships, which are currently exempt from NOx standards applying in emission control areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/06/16/carnival_3_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faig Abbasov concluded “There are enough mature technologies to clean up cruise ships. Shore-side electricity can help cut in-port emissions, batteries are a solution for shorter distances and hydrogen technology can power even the biggest cruise ships. The cruise sector are apparently not willing to make the shift voluntarily, so we need governments to step in and mandate zero emission standards.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New Hampshire installs historical marker to honor the creation of BASIC</title>
<link>https://www.concordmonitor.com/BASIC-Dartmouth-Kemeny-time-sharing-historical-26164409</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.concordmonitor.com/BASIC-Dartmouth-Kemeny-time-sharing-historical-26164409</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It took 10 months to get it done, but the Granite State is now officially a Geeky State: The latest New Hampshire Historical Highway Marker, celebrating the creation of the BASIC computer language at Dartmouth in 1964, has officially been installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody who has ever typed a GOTO command can feel proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, loyal reader, I can feel particularly proud. Last August, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2018/08/16/nh-historical-markers-arent-geeky-enough-and-were-going-to-fix-that-starting-with-basic/&quot;&gt;wrote in this column&lt;/a&gt; that the 255 official historical markers placed alongside state roads told us enough about covered bridges and birthplaces of famous people but not enough about geekiness. Since anybody can submit a suggestion for a new sign, I thought I’d give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of BASIC, the first programing language designed to let newbies dip their intellectual toes into the cutting-edge world of software, seemed the obvious candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code has probably has done more to introduce more people to computer programming than anything ever created. That includes me: The only functioning programs I’ve ever created were in vanilla BASIC, and I still recall the great satisfaction of typing “100.END.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BASIC wasn’t just a toy for classrooms. It proved robust enough to survive for decades, helping launch Microsoft along the way, and there are descendants still in use today. In short, it’s way more important than any covered bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted Thomas Kurtz, the retired Dartmouth math professor who created BASIC along with the late John Kemeny, and asked what he thought of the idea. He gave me the thumbs-up. I approached Dartmouth College, which created a big website when BASIC turned 50 in 2014 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html&quot;&gt;dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html&lt;/a&gt;), and they liked the idea, too. Recently retired math professor Scot Drysdale came to help me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original idea was to mention both BASIC and the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, an early system by which far-flung computers could share resources. They were created hand-in-hand as part of Kemeny’s idea of putting computing in the hands of the unwashed masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the N.H. Division of Historical Resources, which has decades of experience creating these markers, said it would be too hard to cram both concepts into the limited verbiage of a sign. DTSS’s time in the spotlight will have to wait, in the meantime you can play with an emulator at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dtss.dartmouth.edu/index.php&quot;&gt;dtss.dartmouth.edu/index.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take a selfie with the new marker, find it on the east side of Route 120 about halfway between the old Trumbull Nelson facility and Hanover Public Works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That location might seem a little odd but state highway markers have to be on state highways and all the roads around Dartmouth College are owned by Hanover or the college itself, so this was about as close as we could get to the school on a visible, well-traveled route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the marker is so new that the state hasn’t added it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/markers/documents/markers_bynumber.pdf&quot;&gt;their official list&lt;/a&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s next? Last year I put out a call for suggestions for the next geek-oriented historical marker, once this gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas included the first use of the term “artificial intelligence” at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the 2013 twin-prime conjecture breakthrough by “Tom” Zhang at UNH, and Dean Kamen’s invention of the infusion pump for diabetics, which launched his R&amp;amp;D empire and Manchester’s status as a tech hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first of those is too similar, geographically and conceptually, to the BASIC marker; the second is maybe &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; geeky; and the third – well, Kamen hardly needs more celebration. That also goes for Ralph Baer’s team developing the first home video game in Nashua; that already has a plaque in Nashua, not to mention a statue in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want something that’s interesting, important and just a bit surprising. Here’s my favorite idea, suggested by a reader in Milford: Celebrate Bernice Perry, one of the first and perhaps the best-known aerial photographer in New Hampshire and also the first woman pilot in New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry got her pilot’s license in 1929 when flying was as much an engineering feat as a job in transportation, and was later the first woman commercial pilot in all of New England. She was a charter member of the Ninety-Nines, the pioneering group of American female aviators headed by Amelia Earhart at a time when by some measures there were only 99 female pilots in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry’s aerial photography is all over the place in Milford, including a gigantic shot of the town that adorns a bank which just reopened as a high-end restaurant, so that’s where I’d like to see a plaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll have to do much lifting on this one. The Milford Historical Society has a ton of information on Perry and the Aviation Museum of New Hampshire at Manchester airport had a program about her work this spring, on the 90th anniversary of her pilot’s license. It should be a breeze!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, of course, keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Where Is It?</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mh370-malaysia-airlines/590653/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mh370-malaysia-airlines/590653/</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated at 10:25 a.m. ET on June 17, 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Disappearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;At 12:42 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the quiet, moonlit night of March 8, 2014, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines took off from Kuala Lumpur and turned toward Beijing, climbing to its assigned cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. The designator for Malaysia Airlines is MH. The flight number was 370. Fariq Hamid, the first officer, was flying the airplane. He was 27 years old. This was a training flight for him, the last one; he would soon be fully certified. His trainer was the pilot in command, a man named Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who at 53 was one of the most senior captains at Malaysia Airlines. In Malaysian style, he was known by his first name, Zaharie. He was married and had three adult children. He lived in a gated development. He owned two houses. In his first house he had installed an elaborate Microsoft flight simulator. He flew it frequently, and often posted to online forums about his hobby. In the cockpit, Fariq would have been deferential to him, but Zaharie was not known for being overbearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;audm--download-cta&quot;&gt;To hear more feature stories,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=atlantic&amp;amp;utm_content=good_night&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'590653'&quot;&gt;get the Audm iPhone app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cabin were 10 flight attendants, all of them Malaysian. They had 227 passengers to care for, including five children. Most of the passengers were Chinese; of the rest, 38 were Malaysian, and in descending order the others came from Indonesia, Australia, India, France, the United States, Iran, Ukraine, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Russia, and Taiwan. Up in the cockpit that night, while First Officer Fariq flew the airplane, Captain Zaharie handled the radios. The arrangement was standard. Zaharie’s transmissions were a bit unusual. At 1:01 a.m. he radioed that they had leveled off at 35,000 feet—a superfluous report in radar-surveilled airspace where the norm is to report leaving an altitude, not arriving at one. At 1:08 the flight crossed the Malaysian coastline and set out across the South China Sea in the direction of Vietnam. Zaharie again reported the plane’s level at 35,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven minutes later, as the airplane closed in on a waypoint near the start of Vietnamese air-traffic jurisdiction, the controller at Kuala Lumpur Center radioed, “Malaysian three-seven-zero, contact Ho Chi Minh one-two-zero-decimal-nine. Good night.” Zaharie answered, “Good night. Malaysian three-seven-zero.” He did not read back the frequency, as he should have, but otherwise the transmission sounded normal. It was the last the world heard from MH370. The pilots never checked in with Ho Chi Minh or answered any of the subsequent attempts to raise them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary radar relies on simple, raw pings off objects in the sky. Air-traffic-control systems use what is known as secondary radar. It depends on a transponder signal that is transmitted by each airplane and contains richer information—for instance, the airplane’s identity and altitude—than primary radar does. Five seconds after MH370 crossed into Vietnamese airspace, the symbol representing its transponder dropped from the screens of Malaysian air traffic control, and 37 seconds later the entire airplane disappeared from secondary radar. The time was 1:21 a.m., 39 minutes after takeoff. The controller in Kuala Lumpur was dealing with other traffic elsewhere on his screen and simply didn’t notice. When he finally did, he assumed that the airplane was in the hands of Ho Chi Minh, somewhere out beyond his range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese controllers, meanwhile, saw MH370 cross into their airspace and then disappear from radar. They apparently misunderstood a formal agreement by which Ho Chi Minh was supposed to inform Kuala Lumpur immediately if an airplane that had been handed off was more than five minutes late checking in. They tried repeatedly to contact the aircraft, to no avail. By the time they picked up the phone to inform Kuala Lumpur, 18 minutes had passed since MH370’s disappearance from their radar screens. What ensued was an exercise in confusion and incompetence. Kuala Lumpur’s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre should have been notified within an hour of the disappearance. By 2:30 a.m., it still had not been. Four more hours elapsed before an emergency response was finally begun, at 6:32 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the airplane should have been landing in Beijing. The search for it was initially concentrated in the South China Sea, between Malaysia and Vietnam. It was an international effort by 34 ships and 28 aircraft from seven different countries. But MH370 was nowhere near there. Within a matter of days, primary-radar records salvaged from air-traffic-control computers, and partially corroborated by secret Malaysian air-force data, revealed that as soon as MH370 disappeared from secondary radar, it turned sharply to the southwest, flew back across the Malay Peninsula, and banked around the island of Penang. From there it flew northwest up the Strait of Malacca and out across the Andaman Sea, where it faded beyond radar range into obscurity. That part of the flight took more than an hour to accomplish and suggested that this was not a standard case of a hijacking. Nor was it like an accident or pilot-suicide scenario that anyone had encountered before. From the start, MH370 was leading investigators in unexplored directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery surrounding MH370 has been a focus of continued investigation and a source of sometimes feverish public speculation. The loss devastated families on four continents. The idea that a sophisticated machine, with its modern instruments and redundant communications, could simply vanish seems beyond the realm of possibility. It is hard to permanently delete an email, and living off the grid is nearly unachievable even when the attempt is deliberate. A Boeing 777 is meant to be electronically accessible at all times. The disappearance of the airplane has provoked a host of theories. Many are preposterous. All are given life by the fact that, in this age, commercial airplanes don’t just vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one did, and more than five years later its precise whereabouts remain unknown. Even so, a great deal about the disappearance of MH370 has come into clearer view, and reconstructing much of what happened that night is possible. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight-data recorder may never be recovered, but what we still need to know is unlikely to come from the black boxes. Instead, it will have to come from Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Beachcomber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;On the evening&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the airplane’s disappearance, a middle-aged American man named Blaine Gibson was sitting in his late mother’s house in Carmel, California, sorting through her affairs in preparation for selling the property. He heard the news about MH370 on CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson, whom I met recently in Kuala Lumpur, is a lawyer by training. He has lived in Seattle for more than 35 years but spends little time there. His father, who died decades ago, was a World War I veteran who endured a mustard-gas attack in the trenches, received a Silver Star for gallantry, and went on to serve as the chief justice of California for more than 24 years. His mother was a graduate of Stanford Law School and an ardent environmentalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson was an only child. His mother liked to travel internationally, and she took him with her. At the age of 7 he decided that his life’s goal would be to visit every country in the world at least once. Ultimately this challenged the definitions of &lt;em&gt;visit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;country&lt;/em&gt;, but he stuck with the mission, forgoing any chance of a sustained career and subsisting on a modest inheritance. By his own account, along the way he dabbled in some famous mysteries—the end of the Mayan civilization in the jungles of Guatemala and Belize, the Tunguska meteor explosion in eastern Siberia, and the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the mountains of Ethiopia. He printed up cards identifying himself: &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;adventurer. explorer. truth seeker.&lt;/span&gt; He wore a fedora, like Indiana Jones. When news arrived of MH370’s disappearance, he was predisposed to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite reflexive denials by Malaysian officials, and outright obfuscation by the Malaysian air force, the truth about the airplane’s strange flight path quickly began to emerge. It turned out that MH370 had continued to link up intermittently with a geostationary Indian Ocean satellite operated by Inmarsat, a commercial vendor in London, for six hours after the airplane disappeared from secondary radar. This meant that the airplane had not suddenly suffered some catastrophic event. During those six hours it is presumed to have remained in high-speed, high-altitude cruising flight. The Inmarsat linkups, some of them known as “handshakes,” were electronic blips: routine connections that amounted to the merest whisper of communication, because the intended contents of the system—passenger entertainment, cockpit texts, automated maintenance reports—had been isolated or switched off. All told, there were seven linkups: two initiated automatically by the airplane, and five others initiated automatically by the Inmarsat ground station. There were also two satellite-phone calls; they went unanswered but provided additional data. Associated with most of these connections were two values that Inmarsat had only recently begun to log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and more accurate of the values is known as the burst-timing offset, or what I will call the “distance value.” It is a measure of the transmission time to and from the airplane, and therefore of the plane’s distance from the satellite. It does not pinpoint a single location but rather all equidistant locations—a roughly circular set of possibilities. Given the range limits of MH370, the near-circles can be reduced to arcs. The most important arc is the seventh and last one—defined by a final handshake tied in complex ways to fuel exhaustion and the failure of the main engines. The seventh arc stretches from Central Asia in the north to the vicinity of Antarctica in the south. It was crossed by MH370 at 8:19 a.m., Kuala Lumpur time. Calculations of likely flight paths place the airplane’s intersection with the seventh arc—and therefore its end point—in Kazakhstan if the airplane turned north, or in the southern Indian Ocean if it turned south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical analysis indicates with near certainty that the airplane turned south. We know this from Inmarsat’s second logged value—the burst-frequency offset. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to this value as the “Doppler value,” because it includes, most crucially, a measure of radio-frequency Doppler shifts associated with high-speed movement in relation to satellite position, and is a natural part of satellite communications for airplanes in flight. Doppler shifts have to be predicted and compensated for by airborne systems in order for satellite communications to function. But the compensation is not quite perfect, because satellites—particularly as they age—do not transmit signals in precisely the way airplanes have been programmed to expect. Their orbits may tilt slightly. They are also affected by temperature. These imperfections leave telltale traces. Although Doppler-shift logs had never been used before to determine the location of an airplane, Inmarsat technicians in London were able to discern a significant distortion suggesting a turn to the south at 2:40 a.m. The turn point was a bit north and west of Sumatra, the northernmost island of Indonesia. It has been assumed, at some analytical risk, that the airplane then flew straight and level for a very long while in the general direction of Antarctica, which lay beyond its range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six hours, the Doppler data indicated a steep descent—as much as five times greater than a normal descent rate. Within a minute or two of crossing the seventh arc, the plane dived into the ocean, possibly shedding components before impact. Judging from the electronic evidence, this was not a controlled attempt at a water landing. The airplane must have fractured instantly into a million pieces. But no one knew where the impact had occurred, much less why. And no one had the slightest bit of physical evidence to confirm that the satellite interpretations were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after the disappearance, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published the first report about the satellite transmissions, indicating that the airplane had most likely stayed aloft for hours after going silent. Malaysian officials eventually admitted that the account was true. The Malaysian regime was said to be one of the most corrupt in the region. It was also proving itself to be furtive, fearful, and unreliable in its investigation of the flight. Accident investigators dispatched from Europe, Australia, and the United States were shocked by the disarray they encountered. Because the Malaysians withheld what they knew, the initial sea searches were concentrated in the wrong place—the South China Sea—and found no floating debris. Had the Malaysians told the truth right away, such debris might have been found and used to identify the airplane’s approximate location; the black boxes might have been recovered. The underwater search for them ultimately centered on a narrow swath of ocean thousands of miles away. But even a narrow swath of the ocean is a big place. It took two years to find the black boxes from Air France 447, which crashed into the Atlantic on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009—and the searchers had known exactly where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/malaysian-officials-update-last-words-spoken-from-mh370/359948/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'590653'&quot;&gt;Read: Malaysian officials update last words spoken from MH370&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial search of surface waters ended in April 2014, after nearly two months of futile efforts, and the focus shifted to the ocean depths, where it remains today. Blaine Gibson followed the frustration at first from a distance. He sold his mother’s house and moved to the Golden Triangle of northern Laos, where he and a business partner set about building a restaurant on the Mekong River. He joined a Facebook discussion group dedicated to the loss of MH370. It was filled with speculation, but also with news that reflected useful thinking about what could have happened to the airplane and where the main wreckage might be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Malaysians were nominally in charge of the entire investigation, they lacked the means and expertise to mount a subsea search-and-recovery effort; the Australians, as good international citizens, took the lead. The areas of the Indian Ocean that the satellite data pointed to—about 1,200 miles southwest of Perth—were so deep and unexplored that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/mh370-search-ocean/518946/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'590653'&quot;&gt;first challenge was to map the undersea topography&lt;/a&gt; sufficiently to allow side-scanning sonar vehicles to be safely towed miles beneath the surface. The ocean floor was lined with ridges in a blackness where light had never penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson began to wonder whether, for all the strenuous underwater searching, debris from the airplane might someday simply wash up on a beach somewhere. While visiting friends on the coast of Cambodia, he asked whether they had stumbled on anything. They had not. Debris couldn’t possibly have drifted to Cambodia from the southern Indian Ocean, but until the airplane’s wreckage was found—proving that the southern Indian Ocean was indeed its grave—Gibson was determined to keep an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2015, a one-year commemoration of MH370’s disappearance was held in Kuala Lumpur by the passengers’ next of kin. Uninvited, and largely unknown to them, Gibson decided to attend. Because he had no special knowledge to offer, his arrival raised eyebrows. People don’t know what to make of a dilettante. The commemoration took place in an outdoor space at a shopping mall, a typical event venue for Kuala Lumpur. The purpose was to grieve collectively, but also to maintain pressure on the government of Malaysia to provide explanations. Hundreds of people attended, many from China. There was a bit of music on a stage. In the background a large poster showed the silhouette of a Boeing 777, along with the words &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;who&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;why&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;whom&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;, and also &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;impossible&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;unprecedented&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;vanished&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;clueless&lt;/span&gt;. The principal speaker was a young Malaysian woman named Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother had been on the flight. Nathan is a criminal-defense lawyer specializing in death-penalty cases, of which Malaysia has many because of draconian laws. She had emerged as the most effective representative of the next of kin. She took to the stage wearing an oversize T-shirt printed with a cartoon graphic of MH370 and the exhortation &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;search on&lt;/span&gt;, and then proceeded to describe her mother, the deep love she felt for her, and the difficulty of enduring her disappearance. On occasion she quietly wept, as did some in the audience, including Gibson. Afterward, he approached Nathan and asked whether she would accept a hug from a stranger. She did, and they became friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-10&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson left the commemoration determined to help by addressing a gap he had perceived—the lack of coastal searches for floating debris. This would be his niche. He would become MH370’s private beachcomber. The official investigators, primarily Australian and Malaysian, were heavily invested in their underwater search. They would have scoffed at Gibson’s ambition, just as they would have scoffed at the prospect that on beaches hundreds of miles apart, Gibson would find pieces of the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-11&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. The Mother Lode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;The Indian Ocean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; washes against tens of thousands of miles of coastline, depending on how many islands you include in your count. When Blaine Gibson started looking for debris, he did not have a plan. He flew to Myanmar because he had been intending to go there anyway, then went to the coast and asked some villagers where flotsam tended to drift ashore. They directed him to several beaches, and a fisherman took him there by boat. He found some debris, but nothing that came from an airplane. He advised the villagers to be on the lookout, left his contact number, and moved on. Similarly, he visited the Maldives and the islands of Rodrigues and Mauritius without finding debris of interest. Then came July 29, 2015. About 16 months after the airplane went missing, a municipal beach-cleanup crew on the French island of Réunion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/the-enduring-mystery-of-mh-370/400082/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'590653'&quot;&gt;came upon a torn piece of airfoil&lt;/a&gt; about six feet long that seemed to have just washed ashore. The foreman of the crew, a man named Johnny Bègue, realized that it might have come from an airplane, but he had no idea which one. He briefly considered making it into a memorial—setting it on an adjacent lawn and planting some flowers around it—but instead he called a local radio station with the news. A team of gendarmes showed up and took the piece away. It was quickly determined to be a part of a Boeing 777, a control surface called a flaperon that is attached to the trailing edge of the wings. Subsequent examination of serial numbers showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/the-first-evidence-from-flight-mh370/400571/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'590653'&quot;&gt;it had come from MH370&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-12&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was the necessary physical evidence of what had already been electronically surmised—that the flight had ended violently in the Indian Ocean, albeit somewhere still unknown and thousands of miles to the east of Réunion. The families of those aboard the airplane had to surrender any fantasies that their loved ones might still be alive. It came as a shock, no matter how rational and realistic they had been. Grace Nathan was devastated. She told me that she could barely function for weeks after the flaperon was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson flew to Réunion and found Johnny Bègue on his beach. Bègue was friendly. He showed Gibson where he had found the flaperon. Gibson poked around for other debris but without expectation, because the French government had already mounted a follow-up search to no avail. Flotsam takes a while to drift across the Indian Ocean, moving from east to west at the low southern latitudes, and a flaperon might arrive sooner than other debris because parts of it could rise above the water and act as a sail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newspaper reporter in Réunion interviewed Gibson for a story about the visit of this independent American investigator. Gibson wore a &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;search on&lt;/span&gt; T-shirt for the occasion. He then flew to Australia, where he spoke with two oceanographers—Charitha Pattiaratchi, of the University of Western Australia at Perth, and David Griffin, who worked for a government research center in Hobart and had been assigned to advise the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the lead agency in the search for MH370. Both men were experts on Indian Ocean currents and winds. Griffin in particular had spent years tracking drift buoys, and had launched an effort to model the complex drift characteristics of the flaperon during its voyage to Réunion—the hope being to backtrack and narrow the geographic scope of the undersea search. Gibson’s needs were easier to handle: He wanted to know the most likely locations for floating debris to come ashore. The answer was the northeast coast of Madagascar and, to a lesser degree, the coast of Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-13&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson opted for Mozambique because he had not been there before and could bag it as his 177th country. He chose a town called Vilanculos, because it seemed safe and had nice beaches. He got there in February 2016. As he recalls, he asked for advice from local fishermen, and was told of a sandbank called Paluma that lay beyond a reef, where fishermen would go to collect nets and buoys that washed in from the Indian Ocean. Gibson paid a boatman named Suleman to take him there. They found all sorts of junk, mostly plastic. Suleman called Gibson over. Holding up a gray triangular scrap about two feet across, he asked, “Is this 370?” The scrap had a honeycomb structure and the stenciled words &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;no step&lt;/span&gt; on one surface. Gibson’s first impression was that it could not have come from a large airplane. To me he said, “So my mind was telling me it’s not from the plane, but my heart was telling me it’s from the plane. Then we had to take the boat back. And here we get into the personal thing. Two dolphins appeared and helped lead us off that sandbank—my mother’s spirit animal. When I saw those dolphins, I thought, &lt;em&gt;This is from the plane&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make of that what you will, but Gibson turned out to be right. The scrap—from a horizontal-stabilizer panel—was determined to almost certainly be from MH370. Gibson flew to the capital, Maputo, and handed the debris to the Australian consul. Then he flew to Kuala Lumpur, just in time for the second-anniversary commemoration. This time he was welcomed as a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-14&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2016, Gibson turned his attention to the remote northeastern shores of Madagascar. This turned out to be the mother lode. Gibson says he found three pieces on the first day, and another two a few days later. The following week, on a beach eight miles away, three more pieces were delivered to him. And so it has gone ever since. Word has gotten around that he will pay for MH370 debris. He says he once paid so much for a piece—$40—that an entire village went on a day-long bender. Apparently the local rum is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of debris washed up that had nothing to do with the airplane. But of the several dozen pieces that have been identified to date as certain or likely or suspected to have come from MH370, Gibson has been responsible for the discovery of roughly a third. Some pieces are still being investigated. Gibson’s influence has been so large that David Griffin, though grateful to him, has worried that the perceived debris pattern may now be statistically skewed toward Madagascar, perhaps at the expense of points farther north. He has given this worry a name: “The Gibson Effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that, after five years, no one has yet been able to work backwards from where the debris has washed ashore and trace it to some point of origin in the southern Indian Ocean. In his insistence on maintaining an open mind, Gibson still holds out the hope of finding new debris that will explain the disappearance—charred wiring indicating a fire, for instance, or shrapnel-peppered evidence of a missile strike—although what is known about the flight’s final hours largely precludes such possibilities. What Gibson’s discovery of so many bits of debris has confirmed is that the signals analysis was correct. The airplane flew for six hours until the flight came suddenly to an end. There was no effort by someone at the controls to bring the airplane down gently. It shattered. There is still a chance, Gibson thinks, of finding the equivalent of a message in a bottle—a note of desperation scribbled by someone in his or her last moments on the doomed airplane. On the beaches, Gibson has found a few backpacks and a large number of purses, all of which have been empty. The closest he has come to finding such a note, he says, was a message written in Malay on the underside of a baseball cap. Translated, it read, “To whom it may concern. My dear friend, meet me at the guesthouse later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-16&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution-number&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;—1:21 a.m., March 8, 2014:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the South China Sea, near a navigational waypoint between Malaysia and Vietnam, MH370 drops from air-traffic-control radar and turns southwest, back across the Malay Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution-number&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;—Roughly an hour later:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After flying northwest above the Strait of Malacca, the airplane makes what investigators call the “final  major turn” and heads south. The turn and the new course are later reconstructed from satellite data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution-number&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;—April 2014:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surface search is abandoned and a deep-ocean search gets under way. Analysis of satellite data had located MH370’s final electronic “handshake” along an arc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution-number&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;—July 2015:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first piece of debris from MH370—a flaperon—is discovered on the island of Réunion. Other confirmed or likely pieces have been found on widely dispersed beaches in the western Indian Ocean (&lt;em&gt;locations in red&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. The Conspiracies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;Three official investigations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were launched in the wake of MH370’s disappearance. The first was the largest, most rigorous, and most expensive: the technically advanced Australian underwater-search effort, which was focused on locating the main debris in order to retrieve the airplane’s flight-data and cockpit voice recorders. It involved calculations of aircraft performance, the parsing of radar and satellite records, studies of oceanic drift, doses of statistical analysis, and the physical examination of the East African flotsam—much of which came from Blaine Gibson. It required heavy maritime operations in some of the world’s roughest seas. Assisting the effort was a collection of volunteer engineers and scientists who found one another on the internet, called themselves the Independent Group, and collaborated so effectively that the Australians took their work into account and ended up formally thanking them for their insights. In the annals of accident investigation, this had never happened before. Nonetheless, after more than three years and about $160 million, the Australian investigation closed without success. It was picked up in 2018 by an American company called Ocean Infinity, under contract with the Malaysian government on a “no-find, no-fee” basis. This search used advanced underwater-surveillance vehicles and covered a new section of the seventh arc, a section deemed most likely by the Independent Group to bring results. After a few months, it too ended in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-17&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second official investigation belonged to the Malaysian police, and amounted to background checks of everyone on the airplane as well as some of their friends. It is hard to know the true extent of the police discoveries, because the report that resulted from the investigation stopped short of full disclosure. The report was stamped secret and withheld even from other Malaysian investigators, but after it was leaked by someone on the inside, its inadequacies became clear. In particular, it held back on divulging all that was known about the captain, Zaharie. No one was surprised. The prime minister at the time was a nasty man named Najib Razak, who was alleged to be monumentally corrupt. The press in Malaysia was censored. Troublemakers were being picked up and made to disappear. Officials had reason for caution. They had careers to protect, and maybe their lives. It is obvious that decisions were made to not pursue certain avenues that might have reflected poorly on Malaysia Airlines or the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third official investigation was the accident inquiry, intended not to adjudicate liability but to find probable cause, and to be conducted according to the highest global standards by an international team. It was led by an ad hoc working group assembled by the Malaysian government, and was a mess from its inception. The police and military disdained it. Government ministers saw it as a risk. Foreign specialists who were sent to assist began retreating almost as soon as they arrived. An American expert, referring to the international aviation protocol that is supposed to govern accident inquiries, told me, “Annex 13 is tailored for accident investigations in confident democracies, but in countries like Malaysia, with insecure and autocratic bureaucracies, and with airlines that are either government-owned or seen as a matter of national prestige, it always makes for a pretty poor fit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-18&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close observer of the MH370 process said, “It became clear that the primary objective of the Malaysians was to make the subject just go away. From the start there was this instinctive bias against being open and transparent, not because they were hiding some deep, dark secret, but because they did not know where the truth really lay, and they were afraid that something might come out that would be embarrassing. Were they covering up? Yes. They were covering up for the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the investigation produced a 495-page report in weak imitation of Annex 13 requirements. It was stuffed with boilerplate descriptions of 777 systems that had clearly been lifted from Boeing manuals and were of no technical value. Indeed, nothing in the report was of technical value, since Australian publications had already fully covered the relevant satellite information and ocean-drift analysis. The Malaysian report was seen as hardly more than a whitewash whose only real contribution was a frank description of the air-traffic-control failures—presumably because half of them could be blamed on the Vietnamese, and because the Malaysian controllers constituted the weakest local target, politically. The report was released in July 2018, more than four years after the event. It stated that the investigative team was unable to determine the cause of the airplane’s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a conclusion invites continued speculation, even if it is unwarranted. The satellite data provide the best evidence of the airplane’s flight path, and are hard to argue with, but people have to have trust in numbers to accept the story they tell. All sorts of theorists have made claims, amplified by social media, that ignore the satellite data, and in some cases also the radar tracks, the aircraft systems, the air-traffic-control record, the physics of flight, and the basic contours of planetary geography. For example, a British woman who blogs under the name of Saucy Sailoress and does Tarot readings for hire was vagabonding around southern Asia with her husband and dogs in an oceangoing sailboat. She says that on the night MH370 disappeared they were in the Andaman Sea, and she spotted what looked like a cruise missile coming at her. The missile morphed into a low-flying airplane with a well-lit cockpit, bathed in a strange orange glow and trailing smoke. As it flew by she concluded that it was on a suicide mission against a Chinese naval fleet farther out to sea. She did not yet know about the disappearance of MH370, but when, a few days later, she learned of it she drew what was to her the obvious connection. Implausible, perhaps, but she gained an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-19&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Australian has been claiming for several years to have found MH370 by means of Google Earth, in shallow waters and intact; he has refused to disclose the location while he works on crowdfunding an expedition. On the internet you will find claims that the airplane has been found intact in the Cambodian jungle, that it was seen landing in an Indonesian river, that it flew into a time warp, that it was sucked into a black hole. One scenario has the airplane flying off to attack the American military base on Diego Garcia before getting shot down. A recent online report that Captain Zaharie had been discovered alive and was lying in a Taiwanese hospital with amnesia won sufficient acceptance that Malaysia angrily denied it. The news had come from a crudely satirical website that also reported a sexual assault on an American trekker and two Sherpas by a yeti-like creature in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York–based writer named Jeff Wise has hypothesized that one of the electronic systems on board the airplane may have been reprogrammed to provide false data—indicating a turn south into the Indian Ocean when in fact the airplane turned north toward Kazakhstan—in order to lead investigators astray. He calls this the “spoof” scenario, and has elaborated extensively on it, most recently in a 2019 ebook. He proposes that the Russians might have stolen the airplane to create a distraction from the annexation of Crimea, then under way. An obvious weak spot in the argument is the need to explain how, if the airplane was flown to Kazakhstan, all that wreckage ended up in the Indian Ocean. Wise’s answer is that it was planted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-20&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaine Gibson was new to social media when he started his search, and he was in for a surprise. As he recalls, the trolls emerged as soon as he found his first piece—the one labeled &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;no step&lt;/span&gt;—and they multiplied afterward, particularly as the beaches of Madagascar began to bear fruit. The internet provokes emotion even in response to unremarkable events. A catastrophe taps into something toxic. Gibson was accused of exploiting the families and of being a fraud, a publicity hound, a drug addict, a Russian agent, an American agent, and at the very least a dupe. He began receiving death threats—messages on social media and phone calls to friends predicting his demise. One message said that either he would stop looking for debris or he would leave Madagascar in a coffin. Another warned that he would die of polonium poisoning. There were more. He was not prepared for this, and was incapable of shrugging it off. During the days I spent with him in Kuala Lumpur, he kept abreast of the latest attacks with the assistance of a friend in London. He said, “I once made the mistake of going on Twitter. Basically, these people are cyberterrorists. And it works. It’s effective.” He has been traumatized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Gibson arranged a formal mechanism for the transfer of debris: He would turn over any new find to authorities in Madagascar, who would hand it to Malaysia’s honorary consul, who would pack it up and ship it to Kuala Lumpur for examination and storage. On August 24 of that year, the honorary consul was gunned down in his car by an assassin who escaped on a motorcycle and has never been found. A French-language news account alleged that the consul had a shady past; his killing may have had no connection to MH370 at all. Gibson, however, has assumed that there is a connection. A police investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/WEL_MH370_Nostep/4e76d29b2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;The first scrap of debris found by Blaine Gibson, from a horizontal-stabilizer panel, was recovered on a sandbank off the coast of Mozambique in February 2016. (Blaine Gibson)
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-21&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now he largely avoids disclosing his location or travel plans, and for similar reasons avoids using email and rarely speaks over the telephone. He likes Skype and WhatsApp for their encryption. He frequently swaps out his SIM cards. He believes he is sometimes followed and photographed. There is no arguing that Gibson is the only person who has gone out looking for pieces of MH370 on his own and found debris. But the idea that the debris is worth killing for is hard to take seriously. It would be easier to believe if the debris held clues to dark secrets and international intrigue. But the evidence—much of it now out in the open—points in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-22&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. The Possibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;In truth, a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can now be known with certainty about the fate of MH370. First, the disappearance was an intentional act. It is inconceivable that the known flight path, accompanied by radio and electronic silence, was caused by any combination of system failure and human error. Computer glitch, control-system collapse, squall lines, ice, lightning strike, bird strike, meteorite, volcanic ash, mechanical failure, sensor failure, instrument failure, radio failure, electrical failure, fire, smoke, explosive decompression, cargo explosion, pilot confusion, medical emergency, bomb, war, or act of God—none of these can explain the flight path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, despite theories to the contrary, control of the plane was not seized remotely from within the electrical-equipment bay, a space under the forward galley. Pages could be spent explaining why. Control was seized from within the cockpit. This happened in the 20-minute period from 1:01 a.m., when the airplane leveled at 35,000 feet, to 1:21 a.m., when it disappeared from secondary radar. During that same period, the airplane’s automatic condition-reporting system transmitted its regular 30-minute update via satellite to the airline’s maintenance department. It reported fuel level, altitude, speed, and geographic position, and indicated no anomalies. Its transmission meant that the airplane’s satellite-communication system was functioning at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-23&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the airplane dropped from the view of secondary—transponder-enhanced—radar, it is likely, given the implausibility of two pilots acting in concert, that one of them was incapacitated or dead, or had been locked out of the cockpit. Primary-radar records—both military and civilian—later indicated that whoever was flying MH370 must have switched off the autopilot, because the turn the airplane then made to the southwest was so tight that it had to have been flown by hand. Circumstances suggest that whoever was at the controls deliberately depressurized the airplane. At about the same time, much if not all of the electrical system was deliberately shut down. The reasons for that shutdown are not known. But one of its effects was to temporarily sever the satellite link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrical engineer in Boulder, Colorado, named Mike Exner, who is a prominent member of the Independent Group, has studied the radar data extensively. He believes that during the turn, the airplane climbed up to 40,000 feet, which was close to its limit. During the maneuver the passengers would have experienced some g‑forces—that feeling of being suddenly pressed back into the seat. Exner believes the reason for the climb was to accelerate the effects of depressurizing the airplane, causing the rapid incapacitation and death of everyone in the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intentional depressurization would have been an obvious way—and probably the only way—to subdue a potentially unruly cabin in an airplane that was going to remain in flight for hours to come. In the cabin, the effect would have gone unnoticed but for the sudden appearance of the drop-down oxygen masks and perhaps the cabin crew’s use of the few portable units of similar design. None of those cabin masks was intended for more than about 15 minutes of use during emergency descents to altitudes below 13,000 feet; they would have been of no value at all cruising at 40,000 feet. The cabin occupants would have become incapacitated within a couple of minutes, lost consciousness, and gently died without any choking or gasping for air. The scene would have been dimly lit by the emergency lights, with the dead belted into their seats, their faces nestled in the worthless oxygen masks dangling on tubes from the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-24&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cockpit, by contrast, was equipped with four pressurized-oxygen masks linked to hours of supply. Whoever depressurized the airplane would have simply had to slap one on. The airplane was moving fast. On primary radar it appeared as an unidentified blip approaching the island of Penang at nearly 600 miles an hour. The mainland nearby is home to Butterworth Air Base, where a squadron of Malaysian F-18 interceptors is stationed, along with an air-defense radar—not that anyone was paying attention. According to a former official, before the accident report was released last summer, Malaysian air-force officers demanded to review and edit it. In a section called “Malaysian Military Radar,” the report provides a timeline suggesting that the air-defense radar had been actively monitored, that the military was well aware of the identity of the aircraft, and that it purposefully “did not pursue to intercept the aircraft since it was ‘friendly’ and did not pose any threat to national airspace security, integrity and sovereignty.” The question of course is why, if the military knew the airplane had turned around and was flying west, it then allowed the search to continue for days in the wrong body of water, to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its expensive equipment, the air force had failed at its job and could not bring itself to admit the fact. In an Australian television interview, the former Malaysian defense minister said, “If you’re not going to shoot it down, what’s the point in sending [an interceptor] up?” Well, for one thing, you could positively identify the airplane, which at this point was just a blip on primary radar. You could also look through the windows into the cockpit and see who was at the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1:37 a.m., MH370’s regularly scheduled 30-minute automatic condition-reporting system failed to transmit. We now know that the system had been isolated from any satellite transmission—something easily done from within the cockpit—and therefore could not send out any of its scheduled reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1:52 a.m., half an hour into the diversion, MH370 passed just south of Penang Island, made a wide right turn, and headed northwest up the Strait of Malacca. As the airplane turned, the first officer’s cellphone registered with a tower below. It was a single brief connection, during which no content was transmitted. Eleven minutes later, on the assumption that MH370 was still over the South China Sea, a Malaysia Airlines dispatcher sent a text message instructing the pilots to contact Ho Chi Minh’s air-traffic-control center. The message went unanswered. All through the Strait of Malacca, the airplane continued to be hand-flown. It is presumed that everyone in the cabin was dead by this point. At 2:22 a.m., the Malaysian air-force radar picked up the last blip. The airplane was 230 miles northwest of Penang, heading northwest into the Andaman Sea and flying fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three minutes later, at 2:25, the airplane’s satellite box suddenly returned to life. It is likely that this occurred when the full electrical system was brought back up, and that the airplane was repressurized at the same time. When the satellite box came back on, it sent a log-on request to Inmarsat; the ground station responded, and the first linkup was accomplished. Unbeknownst to anyone in the cockpit, the relevant distance and Doppler values were recorded at the ground station, later allowing the first arc to be established. A few minutes later a dispatcher put in a phone call to the airplane. The satellite box accepted the link, but the call went unanswered. An associated Doppler value showed that the airplane had just made a wide turn to the south. To investigators, the place where this happened became known as the “final major turn.” Its location is crucial to all the efforts that have followed, but it has never quite been pinned down. Indonesian air-defense radar should have shown it, but the radar seems to have been turned off for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MH370 was now most likely flying on autopilot, cruising south into the night. Whoever was occupying the cockpit was active and alive. Was this a hijacking? A hijacking is the “third party” solution favored in the official report. It is the least painful explanation for anyone in authority that night. It has immense problems, however. The main one is that the cockpit door was fortified, electrically bolted, and surveilled by a video feed that the pilots could see. Also, less than two minutes passed between Zaharie’s casual “good night” to the Kuala Lumpur controller and the start of the diversion, with the attendant loss of the transponder signal. How would hijackers have known to make their move precisely during the handoff to Vietnamese air traffic control, and then gained access so quickly and smoothly that neither of the pilots had a chance to transmit a distress call? It is possible of course that the hijackers were known to the pilots—that they were invited into the cockpit—but even that does not explain the lack of a radio transmission, particularly during the hand-flown turn away from Beijing. Both of the control yokes had transmitter switches, within the merest finger reach, and some signal could have been sent in the moments before an attempted takeover. Furthermore, every one of the passengers and cabin-crew members has been investigated and cleared of suspicion by teams of Malaysian and Chinese investigators aided by the FBI. The quality of that police work is open to question, but it was thorough enough to have uncovered the identities of two Iranians who were traveling under false names with stolen passports—seeking, however, nothing more nefarious than political asylum in Germany. It is possible that stowaways—by definition unrecorded on the airplane’s manifest—had hidden in the equipment bay. If so, they would have had access to two circuit breakers that, if pulled, would have unbolted the cockpit door. But that scenario has problems, too. The bolts click loudly when they open—an unambiguous sound that would have been familiar to the pilots. The hijackers would then have had to open a galley-floor hatch from below, climb a short ladder, evade notice by the cabin crew, evade the surveillance video, and enter the cockpit before either of the pilots transmitted a distress call. It is unlikely that this could have happened, just as it is unlikely that a flight attendant held hostage could have used the door keypad to allow sudden entry without firing off a warning. Furthermore, what would the purpose be of a hijacking? Money? Politics? Publicity? An act of war? A terrorist attack? The intricate seven-hour profile of MH370’s deviation into oblivion fits none of these scenarios. And no one has claimed responsibility for the act. Anonymity is not consistent with any of these motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Captain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;This leaves us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a different sort of event, a hijacking from within where no forced entry is required—by a pilot who runs amok. Reasonable people may resist the idea that a pilot would murder hundreds of innocent passengers as the collateral price of killing himself. The definitive response is that this has happened before. In 1997, a captain working for a Singaporean airline called SilkAir is believed to have disabled the black boxes of a Boeing 737 and to have plunged the airplane at supersonic speeds into a river.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mh370-malaysia-airlines/590653/#Correction&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'590653'&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; In 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990 was deliberately crashed into the sea by its co-pilot off the coast of Long Island, resulting in the loss of everyone on board. In 2013, just months before MH370 disappeared, the captain of LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 flew his Embraer E190 twin jet from cruising altitude into the ground, killing all 27 passengers and all six crew members. The most recent case is the Germanwings Airbus that was deliberately crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015, also causing the loss of everyone on board. Its co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had waited for the pilot to use the bathroom and then locked him out. Lubitz had a record of depression and—as investigations later discovered—had made a study of MH370’s disappearance, one year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-crash-of-egyptair-990/302332/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'590653'&quot;&gt;From the November 2001 issue: William Langewiesche on EgyptAir 990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of MH370, it is difficult to see the co-pilot as the perpetrator. He was young and optimistic, and reportedly planning to get married. He had no history of any sort of trouble, dissent, or doubts. He was not a German signing on to a life in a declining industry of budget airlines, low salaries, and even lower prestige. He was flying a glorious Boeing 777 in a country where the national airline and its pilots are still considered a pretty big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the captain, Zaharie, who raises concerns. The first warning is his portrayal in the official reports as someone beyond reproach—a good pilot and placid family man who liked to play with a flight simulator. This is the image promoted by Zaharie’s family, but it is contradicted by multiple indications of trouble that too obviously have been brushed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police discovered aspects of Zaharie’s life that should have caused them to dig more deeply. The formal conclusions they drew were inadequate. The official account, referring to Zaharie as the PIC, or pilot in command, had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PIC’s ability to handle stress at work was reported to be good. There was no known history of apathy, anxiety, or irritability. There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict, or family stresses … There were no behavioral signs of social isolation, change of habits or interest … On studying the PIC’s behavioral pattern on the CCTV [at the airport] on the day of the flight and prior 3 flights, there were no significant behavioral changes observed. On all the CCTV recordings the appearance was similar, i.e. well-groomed and attired. The gait, posture, facial expressions and mannerisms were his normal characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was either irrelevant or at odds with what was knowable about Zaharie. The truth, as I discovered after speaking in Kuala Lumpur with people who knew him or knew about him, is that Zaharie was often lonely and sad. His wife had moved out, and was living in the family’s second house. By his own admission to friends, he spent a lot of time pacing empty rooms waiting for the days between flights to go by. He was also a romantic. He is known to have established a wistful relationship with a married woman and her three children, one of whom was disabled, and to have obsessed over two young internet models, whom he encountered on social media, and for whom he left Facebook comments that apparently did not elicit responses. Some were shyly sexual. He mentioned in one comment, for example, that one of the girls, who was wearing a robe in a posted photo, looked like she had just emerged from a shower. Zaharie seems to have become somewhat disconnected from his earlier, well-established life. He was in touch with his children, but they were grown and gone. The detachment and solitude that can accompany the use of social media—and Zaharie used social media a lot—probably did not help. There is a strong suspicion among investigators in the aviation and intelligence communities that he was clinically depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Malaysia were a country where, in official circles, the truth was welcome, then the police portrait of Zaharie as a healthy and happy man would carry some weight. But Malaysia is not such a country, and the official omission of evidence to the contrary only adds to all the other evidence that Zaharie was a troubled man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forensic examinations of Zaharie’s simulator by the FBI revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/07/mh370-pilot-flew-suicide-route-on-home-simulator.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'590653'&quot;&gt;he experimented with a flight profile roughly matching that of MH370&lt;/a&gt;—a flight north around Indonesia followed by a long run to the south, ending in fuel exhaustion over the Indian Ocean. Malaysian investigators dismissed this flight profile as merely one of several hundred that the simulator had recorded. That is true, as far as it goes, which is not far enough. Victor Iannello, an engineer and entrepreneur in Roanoke, Virginia, who has become another prominent member of the Independent Group and has done extensive analysis of the simulated flight, underscores what the Malaysian investigators ignored. Of all the profiles extracted from the simulator, the one that matched MH370’s path was the only one that Zaharie did not run as a continuous flight—in other words, taking off on the simulator and letting the flight play out, hour after hour, until it reached the destination airport. Instead he advanced the flight manually in multiple stages, repeatedly jumping the flight forward and subtracting the fuel as necessary until it was gone. Iannello believes that Zaharie was responsible for the diversion. Given that there was nothing technical that Zaharie could have learned by rehearsing the act on a gamelike Microsoft consumer product, Iannello suspects that the purpose of the simulator flight may have been to leave a bread-crumb trail to say goodbye. Referring to the flight profile that MH370 would follow, Iannello said of Zaharie, “It’s as if he was simulating a simulation.” Without a note of explanation, Zaharie’s reasoning is impossible to know. But the simulator flight cannot easily be dismissed as a random coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kuala Lumpur, I met with one of Zaharie’s lifelong friends, a fellow 777 captain whose name I have omitted because of possible repercussions for him. He too believed that Zaharie was guilty, a conclusion he had come to reluctantly. He described the mystery as a pyramid that is broad at the base and one man wide at the top, meaning that the inquiry might have begun with many possible explanations but ended up with a single one. He said, “It doesn’t make sense. It’s hard to reconcile with the man I knew. But it’s the necessary conclusion.” I asked about the need Zaharie would have had to somehow deal with his cockpit companion, First Officer Fariq Hamid. He replied, “That’s easy. Zaharie was an examiner. All he had to say was ‘Go check something in the cabin,’ and the guy would have been gone.” I asked about a motive. He had no idea. He said, “Zaharie’s marriage was bad. In the past he slept with some of the flight attendants. And so what? We all do. You’re flying all over the world with these beautiful girls in the back. But his wife knew.” He agreed that this was hardly a reason to go berserk, but thought Zaharie’s emotional state might have been a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the absence of all of this from the official report— Zaharie’s travails; the peculiar nature of the flight profile on the simulator—not to mention the technical inadequacies of the report itself, constitute a cover-up? At this point, we cannot say. We know some of what the investigators knew but chose not to reveal. There is likely more that they discovered and that we do not yet know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the demise of MH370. It is easy to imagine Zaharie toward the end, strapped into an ultra-comfortable seat in the cockpit, inhabiting his cocoon in the glow of familiar instruments, knowing that there could be no return from what he had done, and feeling no need to hurry. He would long since have repressurized the airplane and warmed it to the right degree. There was the hum of the living machine, the beautiful abstractions on the flatscreen displays, the carefully considered backlighting of all the switches and circuit breakers. There was the gentle &lt;em&gt;whoosh&lt;/em&gt; of the air rushing by. The cockpit is the deepest, most protective, most private sort of home. Around 7 a.m., the sun rose over the eastern horizon, to the airplane’s left. A few minutes later it lit the ocean far below. Had Zaharie already died in flight? He could at some point have depressurized the airplane again and brought his life to an end. This is disputed and far from certain. Indeed, there is some suspicion, from fuel-exhaustion simulations that investigators have run, that the airplane, if simply left alone, would not have dived quite as radically as the satellite data suggest that it did—a suspicion, in other words, that someone was at the controls at the end, actively helping to crash the airplane. Either way, somewhere along the seventh arc, after the engines failed from lack of fuel, the airplane entered a vicious spiral dive with descent rates that ultimately may have exceeded 15,000 feet a minute. We know from that descent rate, as well as from Blaine Gibson’s shattered debris, that the airplane disintegrated into confetti when it hit the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Truth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;For now the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; official investigations have petered out. The Australians have done what they could. The Chinese want to move on and are censoring any news that might inflame the passions of the families. The French are off in France, rehashing the satellite data. The Malaysians just wish the whole subject would go away. I attended an event in the administrative city of Putrajaya last fall, where Grace Nathan and Gibson stood in front of the cameras with the transport minister, Anthony Loke. The minister formally accepted five new pieces of debris collected over the summer. He was miserable to the point of being angry. He barely spoke, and took no questions from the press. Nathan was seething at the minister’s attitude. That night, over dinner, she insisted that the government should not be allowed to walk away so easily. She said, “They didn’t follow protocol. They didn’t follow procedure. I think it’s appalling. More could have been done. As a result of the inaction of the air force—of all of the parties involved in the first hour who didn’t follow protocol—we are stuck like this now. Every one of them breached protocol one time, multiple times. Every single person who had some form of responsibility at the time did not do what he was supposed to do. To varying degrees of severity. Maybe in isolation some might not seem so bad, but when you look at it as a whole, every one of them contributed 100 percent to the fact that the airplane has not been found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every one of them was a government employee. Nathan had hopes that Ocean Infinity, which had recently found a missing Argentine submarine, would return to the search, again on a no-find, no-fee basis. The company had suggested the possibility of doing so earlier that week. But the government of Malaysia would have to sign the contract. Because of the political culture, Nathan worried that it might not—as so far has proved true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/07/excerpts-from-american-ground-unbuilding-the-world-trade-center/302542/&quot; data-omni-index=&quot;0&quot; data-article-id=&quot;3137707&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;inherit&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2016/09/Reuters_Peter_Morgan_9_11/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1523977991&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the wreckage is ever found, it will lay to rest all the theories that depend on ignoring the satellite data or the fact that the airplane flew an intricate path after its initial turn away from Beijing and then remained aloft for six more hours. No, it did not catch on fire yet stay in the air for all that time. No, it did not become a “ghost flight” able to navigate and switch its systems off and then back on. No, it was not shot down after long consideration by nefarious national powers who lingered on its tail before pulling the trigger. And no, it is not somewhere in the South China Sea, nor is it sitting intact in some camouflaged hangar in Central Asia. The one thing all of these explanations have in common is that they contradict the authentic information investigators do possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, finding the wreckage and the two black boxes may accomplish little. The cockpit voice recorder is a self-erasing two-hour loop, and is likely to contain only the sounds of the final alarms going off, unless whoever was at the controls was still alive and in a mood to provide explanations for posterity. The other black box, the flight-data recorder, will provide information about the functioning of the airplane throughout the entire flight, but it will not reveal any relevant system failure, because no such failure can explain what occurred. At best it will answer some relatively unimportant questions, such as when exactly the airplane was depressurized and how long it remained so, or how exactly the satellite box was powered down and then powered back up. The denizens of the internet would be obsessed, but that is hardly an event to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important answers probably don’t lie in the ocean but on land, in Malaysia. That should be the focus moving forward. Unless they are as incompetent as the air force and air traffic control, the Malaysian police know more than they have dared to say. The riddle may not be deep. That is the frustration here. The answers may well lie close at hand, but they are more difficult to retrieve than any black box. If Blaine Gibson wants a real adventure, he might spend a year poking around Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mazda is purging touchscreens from its vehicles</title>
<link>https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1121372_why-mazda-is-purging-touchscreens-from-its-vehicles</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1121372_why-mazda-is-purging-touchscreens-from-its-vehicles</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tablet-like touchscreens have become the ubiquitous interfaces of choice, and they’re seemingly everywhere in daily life, on everything from thermostats to coffee makers and refrigerators. But Mazda really doesn’t think they belong in cars—or at least anywhere near the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a decision that was hastily made, according to company officials. However, as they started studying the effects of touchscreens on driving safety (and driving comfort), it soon became clear what the priorities should be with this completely new system that makes its debut in the 2019 Mazda 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out by looking at actual times—the times spent looking away from the road to make a screen selection, and the time needed to refocus the eyes on something close versus the road ahead—and decided that it needed to home in on factors that reduced that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding the swipe-’n’-swerve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing our research, when a driver would reach towards a touch-screen interface in any vehicle, they would unintentionally apply torque to the steering wheel, and the vehicle would drift out of its lane position,” said Matthew Valbuena, Mazda North America’s lead engineer for HMI and infotainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And of course with a touchscreen you have to be looking at the screen while you’re touching...so for that reason we were comfortable removing the touch-screen functionality,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head-up display that top trims of the Mazda 3 get is now projected onto the windshield. The amount of time it takes the eyes to focus on the head-up display is greatly reduced because it’s now focused on a point 7.5 feet ahead of the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1085515_mazda-ceo-no-plan-for-mazdaspeed-3-rotary-sports-car&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mazda CEO: No plan for Mazdaspeed 3, rotary sports car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img name=&quot;tccimg_100689516_l&quot; title=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; data-width=&quot;1024&quot; data-height=&quot;682&quot; data-url=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689516_l.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689516_l.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of the same reasons, a big screen of any kind that’s closer to the driver’s eyes—like in the Tesla Model 3—isn’t the answer either, Mazda insists. The center display is now 8.8 inches wide and it’s now moved farther away and angled slightly toward the driver. The result is that the combination of a lower glance angle away from the road ahead, and a screen that’s a few inches farther out—reducing the driver’s field of focus (and eye fatigue from going back and forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazda is looking to add more simple, tactile controls into the cars. A quick tilt of the volume knob to the right or left goes forward or back single tracks—or holding it left or right fast-forwards it. A tap of the button mutes the system, and holding it down quickly turns off the screen and everything if it’s currently a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img name=&quot;tccimg_100689525_l&quot; title=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; data-width=&quot;1024&quot; data-height=&quot;682&quot; data-url=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689525_l.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689525_l.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further to the point on physical controls, the company has assured that rotation force and detent strength is consistent across volume, climate control, and all these other knobs. The stroke force for any flat button is also tuned to be the same. And Mazda has adapted the hue of white used to be within a much tighter tolerance (and intensity) across all the displays and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different companies, different coping mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor Authority&lt;/em&gt; has asked a number of automaker HMI experts why they rely on a touch-screen interface. Generally the response from other automakers is caged and revolves around the idea that if phones and tablets are familiar, so too should in-vehicle touchscreens. Audi, for instance has said that part of the reason it’s discontinuing its rotary controller is that a touchscreen better supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety suggested that the cognitive and visual load of touch-screen systems was introducing a potentially dangerous level of distraction, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many automakers have some secondary tactile assistance to try to get your finger to land on the right spot—or the right spot on a trackpad—quicker. For instance, Acura’s newest infotainment system in the RDX has a True Touchpad technology that maintains the same touchpad location for virtual buttons each time, relating them to the screen position; and Lexus’ Remote Touch system uses tactile blips and confirmation sounds as you hover from virtual button to virtual button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img name=&quot;tccimg_100689497_l&quot; title=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; data-width=&quot;1024&quot; data-height=&quot;682&quot; data-url=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689497_l.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2019-mazda-mazda3_100689497_l.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019 Mazda 3 - first drive - Los Angeles, January 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mazda’s newest system in the Mazda 3, the Command Controller is repositioned within the center console so as to feel more natural for those of shorter stature, to allow menu navigation, using what the team called fine motor skills rather than the gross motor skills required by a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the gross motor skills required to simply be a good and safe driver can be quite enough some days.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why Mazda is purging touchscreens from its vehicles</og:title>
<og:description>Tablet-like touchscreens have become the ubiquitous interfaces of choice, and they&amp;rsquo;re seemingly everywhere in daily life, on everything from thermostats to coffee makers and refrigerators. But Mazda really doesn&amp;rsquo;t think they belong in cars&amp;mdash;or at least anywhere near the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a decision that was hastily made...</og:description>

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.723300970874&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt; markup to websites and apps increase their ranking in search engines results and enable awesome features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/structured-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Rich Snippets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gmail markup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hidden-small&quot;&gt;Mapping your app data model to Schema.org structures can be a tedious task. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://api-platform.com/docs/schema-generator&quot;&gt;the generator&lt;/a&gt;, your data model will be a derived from Schema.org. Serializing your data as JSON-LD will not require specific mapping nor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply include a JSON-LD file in your page instead of enriching the DOM: &lt;strong&gt;it’s a matter of minutes before being SEO Ready&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hidden-small&quot;&gt;Schema.org improves the interoperability of your applications. Used with hypermedia technologies such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hydra-cg.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; it's a big step towards the semantic and machine readable web. It opens the way to generic web API clients able to extract and process data from any website or app using such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
