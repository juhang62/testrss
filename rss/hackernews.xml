<title>Kansas City is first major city in U.S. to offer no-cost public transportation</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas City, Missouri, made national headlines last week when its city council voted to make bus rides free, becoming the first major metropolis in the U.S. to provide no-fare public transit starting next year. The cost to the city will be $9 million, which is roughly what the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority brings in annually from the current $1.50 bus fares and $50 monthly passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope among lawmakers and transportation officials is that the city will recoup that expense, and more. By increasing mobility overall, KC is looking to boost economic activity. And proponents of the plan say that helping marginalized communities move around more easily will translate into deeper benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that people have a right to move about this city,” Eric Bunch, a district councilman who co-sponsored the measure along with Mayor Quinton Lucas, told a local radio station last week. “I don’t want to do it for any sort of national recognition; I want to do it because it’s the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction to the news was a mix of fevered enthusiasm and wonkish reserve. Progressive politicians in Nashville, New York City, Portland, and other U.S. cities hailed the decision as an equity victory—especially in a town where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decades-dividing-line-troost-avenue-kansas-city-mo-sees-new-n918851&quot;&gt;single street&lt;/a&gt; historically served as an impenetrable dividing line between black and white, rich and poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others struck a more skeptical note: A number of news articles pointed out that free fares aren’t a panacea for ailing ridership or service gaps, citing &lt;a href=&quot;https://transitcenter.org/transit-be-free/&quot;&gt;a 2019 report from the think tank TransitCenter&lt;/a&gt; that warned as much. “This will reduce barriers to access to people, which is great, but very few routes run frequently,” TransitCenter spokesman Ben Fried told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/12/09/kansas-city-moves-ahead-with-free-buses/&quot;&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “If you reduce barriers to access to a system that doesn’t do a great job connecting people where they need to go, it’s only helping people so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, free transit fares has led to varied outcomes. Several smaller U.S. cities currently offer them, including ski centers such as Vail, Colorado, and university towns such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2013/03/how-free-transit-works-united-states/4887/&quot;&gt;Chapel Hill, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, they’ve experienced strong ridership growth. The largest U.S. city to have experimented with it was Austin, Texas. But when the Texas capital briefly went fare-free from 1989 to 1990, it saw “dramatic rates of vandalism, graffiti, and rowdiness” and escalating “vehicle maintenance and security costs” due to repairs from passenger abuse, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.504.198&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;2002 review of the program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the world’s fare-free transit systems are in Europe, including a number of towns in Poland and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/10/the-petite-french-town-that-turned-a-stadium-boondoggle-into-free-public-transportation/543798/&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. The Estonian city of Tallinn is the largest in the world to support such a program. Within nine months of introducing the concept in 2013, the capital city announced that vehicle traffic had fallen 15 percent and the number of transit passengers had grown 14 percent; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/05/estonia-will-roll-out-free-public-transit-nationwide/560648/&quot;&gt;Estonia recently moved to make transit free nationwide&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/11/tallinn-experiment-estonia-public-transport-free-cities&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; “mixed evidence” as to whether the Tallinn plan has “improved mobility and accessibility of low-income and unemployed residents … [and] no indication that employment opportunities improved as a result of this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the Kansas City council’s decision was still significant. At a time when public transportation systems face greater competition from ride-hailing services and other tech-enabled tools—and with climate change placing new urgency on shifting travelers out of cars—the City of Fountains has shown an unusual willingness to experiment with new ideas, transit experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Bridj, the startup that thought it could connect riders with on-demand transit service along a flexible route in a 14-seat minibus? Kansas City’s transit authority partnered with that fledgling company in one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2016/02/kansas-city-bridj-microtransit/462615/&quot;&gt;the country’s first “microtransit” pilots all the way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to see whether such a tech-enabled service could draw transit riders in a low-density, auto-oriented area. “The way I see Bridj is that it breaks down barriers for people to use public transit,” KCATA CEO Robbie Makinen told CityLab at the time. “There are more options for people to access the whole system. It’s a robust transit system that encapsulates all types of modes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t work: Bridj was a colossal failure. After six months, the vans had provided fewer than 600 rides, hugely short of the 200 daily riders that leaders had hoped for. But microtransit didn’t die (though &lt;a href=&quot;https://humantransit.org/2018/02/is-microtransit-a-sensible-transit-investment.html&quot;&gt;some transit experts think it should&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/mobility-innovation-hub/microtransit/&quot;&gt;Dozens of similar pilots have since appeared across the country&lt;/a&gt;, from Los Angeles to Columbus to Montgomery County, Maryland. Startups like Via are still trying to crack the code of whether microtransit can viably serve large numbers of riders. These players learned lessons from Kansas City’s willingness to see what happened when it linked up with a tech-forward transportation idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uber and Lyft’s ability to pull riders off surface rail is not a trend that will go away,” Seleta Reynolds, general manager of the L.A. Department of Transportation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/05/bridj-is-dead-but-microtransit-isnt/525156/&quot;&gt;told CityLab in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. “We have to continue to test out and try things to transform the way we deliver public transit, in a way that people like better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas City’s move to make fares permanently free on its sales-tax-funded streetcar line also reflects that entrepreneurial spirit, said Bob Bennett, the city’s former chief innovation officer. “Over the last four to five years, there’s been a mindset change at the city, and that mindset change is focusing less on what the ridership and operations of transit mean and more on what the impact of that transportation is,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the KC streetcar. Boosters figure that the 2.2-mile downtown line has brought in more than $2 billion in property value growth since opening in 2015. &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcstreetcar.org/ridership-soars-in-2018/&quot;&gt;Ridership has grown steadily&lt;/a&gt;—unusual for downtown streetcars, which are often a novelty of sorts. City residents recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2018/06/20/kc-streetcar-main-street-extension-approved.html&quot;&gt;voted to double the line in length&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public transit leaders have to be creative in Missouri, considering what they’re handed as funding: In 2017, the state legislature spent a miserable $.34 per capita on transit, a tiny fraction of neighbors like Illinois ($190.42 per capita) and even Kansas ($3.78 per capita). The environment of extreme austerity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-public-transit-among-nations-worst-connecting-workers-jobs&quot;&gt;worsens a host of entrenched racial gaps&lt;/a&gt;, advocates and researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;c-related-content u-full-width u-lazy lazyload&quot; data-include=&quot;css:https://cdn.citylab.com/static/b/frontend/dist/citylab/css/components/related-content.a8ad49998034.css&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;c-related-content__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, if transportation leaders are more concerned with the economic impact of a public transit line than on its actual utility, that could prove to be a problem for riders who rely on the service. As it is, Kansas City’s bus offerings leave a lot to be desired. While the city’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcata.org/transit-initiatives/max_and_bus_rapid_transit&quot;&gt;rapid bus transit line&lt;/a&gt; and streetcar both run every 10 minutes, the majority of the regular lines arrive &lt;a href=&quot;https://ridekc.org/assets/uploads/route-maps/SystemMap.pdf&quot;&gt;every 30 to 60 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. In a sprawling, car-oriented metropolis, that means connections can take hours. Free access to a bus that rarely comes isn’t necessarily helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, experimenting with new ideas means that the city can learn something about how to do public transit better—and so can other cities. Paris is eyeing the notion of making transit free, and Olympia, Washington, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article237257744.html&quot;&gt;plans to roll out such a scheme early next year&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s clearly high time to figure out if reduced fare passes, especially in time of extreme income inequality and stalled wage growth, can make a difference for riders,” said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings Institute. Now the world just has to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nebraska farmers vote overwhelmingly for Right to Repair</title>
<link>https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/nebraska-farmers-vote-overwhelmingly-right-repair</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/nebraska-farmers-vote-overwhelmingly-right-repair</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yesterday, the Nebraska Farm Bureau voted 176-1 to back Right to Repair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nProctor&quot;&gt;@nProctor &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Delegates of the Nebraska Farm Bureau, which represents 58,000 member families, &lt;a href=&quot;https://repair.org/news/2019/12/11/farmers-really-want-their-right-to-repair-by-99&quot;&gt;voted 176-1&lt;/a&gt; to formally endorse the right of its constituents to repair the products they own, and set strong standards for any legislation or agreement with equipment manufacturers. The vote held at the Farm Bureau’s annual meeting clearly shows support for continued work on Right to Repair, and repudiates recent attempts by the equipment industry to convince farmers to settle for a half measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Nebraska delegation  also unanimously voted to submit the final wording of the proposal to the American Farm Bureau. The national group, which has endorsed Right to Repair before,  then can determine whether to adopt the language in its official policy, when it holds its annual meeting in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://repair.org/&quot;&gt;Repair.org&lt;/a&gt; advocate and Nebraska Farm Bureau member Willie Cade, said, &quot;If you didn't know, now you know: Farmers want to be able to fix their stuff. It is gratifying that the Farm Bureau has overwhelming approved real Right to Repair policy for family farms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;U.S. PIRG has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://uspirg.org/feature/usp/right-repair&quot;&gt;running Right to Repair campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uspirg.org/feature/usp/right-repair&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; across the country, which reduce barriers to repair a wide variety of products -- from tablets, to toasters, to tractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Right to Repair matters for farmers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Working equipment is mission-critical for farms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you can’t harvest your crop because the equipment you need isn’t functioning, you can’t earn a living. But modern farm equipment is getting harder and harder to fix because manufacturers such as John Deere &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/right-to-repair-elizabeth-warren-john-deere/&quot;&gt;won’t give farmers or independent mechanics access to what they need&lt;/a&gt; to repair the equipment outside of their dealerships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is especially true of the software locks on the equipment that require access to dealership-only software to fully repair. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&quot;&gt;A documentary by Vice cataloged how farmers have taken to hiring hackers&lt;/a&gt; and buying black market software to bypass the software locks so they can keep equipment in the fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Because of these challenges, farmers have been working to support Right to Repair in states &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/right-to-repair-bill-appears-headed-for-first-time-to-floor-of-minnesota-house/507485152/&quot;&gt;across the country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There has been significant resistance to Right to Repair from both equipment manufacturers and dealerships. In my experience lobbying in several states, I often see the dealerships fighting against it. For example, at a hearing in New Hampshire earlier this year, there were dozens of dealership employees from various John Deere and Kabuto dealerships, even though farm equipment was exempt from the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Their opposition comes as no surprise. Auto dealerships similarly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128839205&quot;&gt;opposed Right to Repair legislation for cars&lt;/a&gt;, which passed on the ballot in Massachusetts in 2012. The Massachusetts law became the basis for a national agreement between the independent auto mechanics and manufacturers, which is in effect nation-wide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A Crain’s Chicago Business article reported that dealers make five times the profit margin off repair than they do off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/why-deere-and-cat-dont-want-customers-do-it-themselves&quot;&gt;the sale of new equipment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment industry has been pitching half-measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In a tactic that some farmers have described to me as simply a stall tactic, equipment manufacturers and dealers have proposed a voluntary agreement to release some of the parts and information needed for repairs, which can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://r2rsolutions.org/&quot;&gt;r2rsolutions.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“It’s a half measure meant to distract farmers, without dealing with the core of the problem,” said Repair.org Executive Director Gay Gordon-Byrne, a leading national voice on Right to Repair. “It’s important that farmers called it out, and put down exactly what a right to repair means.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The measure adopted by the Nebraska Farm Bureau laid out specific standards for any agreement or legislation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right to Repair: Nebraska Farm Bureau supports the implementation of comprehensive right to repair legislation OR a negotiated written agreement between ag producers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This legislation or agreement must: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Be enforceable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Guarantee farmer/repair technician access to the identical information, parts, and tools that are available to dealerships. These items must be fairly and reasonably priced (taking into account both small and large producers) and be delivered in a timely manner. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Include ALL OEM equipment, regardless of age, model, or years in use at the time of the effective date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Differentiate between repair (the restoration of hardware to its original intended function) and illegal “modding,” (modification of original hardware to bypass environmental controls). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Not require any agricultural equipment owner to agree to any contract which removes existing rights. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Furthermore, Nebraska Farm Bureau will support or endorse any legislation or agreement that grants agricultural equipment owners/repair shops with the same rights accorded to automobile &amp;amp; light truck owners/repair shops. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nebraska farmers’ affirmation of these principles is significant because the equipment industry has been pressuring farm groups to accept the terms of their “R2R Solutions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In California, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-farmers-right-to-repair/&quot;&gt;California Farm Bureau signed on to the industry's principles last year&lt;/a&gt;, which frustrated some California farmers. Here’s what California rancher Jeff Buckingham &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-farmers-right-to-repair/&quot;&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I will gladly welcome more ways to fix the equipment on my farm. Let’s be clear, though, this is not right-to-repair … At the end of the day, I bought this equipment, and I want everything I need to keep it running without relying on the manufacturer or dealer.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Nebraska deal is much better for farmers and can set a template for others moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“If we want Right to Repair we will need supporting legislation to keep the industry honest. That’s why the campaigns in states across the country are so critical,” said Cade. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Launch HN: Got-it (YC W19) – Bluetooth labels for tracking things at work</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21805248</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21805248</guid>
<description>Hi Everyone,
&lt;p&gt;It’s Brian and David here and we want to share what we’ve built — ultra thin Bluetooth labels called Got-it (&lt;a href=&quot;https://got-it.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://got-it.com&lt;/a&gt;). It’s like Tile, but for B2B or Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got-it is for tracking things at work as a team. Simply peel and stick, no different from a barcode sticker. But, these are active Bluetooth labels. They're flexible and roughly the size of a little Avery barcode label (28mm x 76mm) and less than 0.5mm thick. They communicate with the phones already in employee pockets, even in background mode. That means no scanning like RFID, and no readers or gateway infrastructure to install in the ceiling or the doorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few photos here: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/rApt25P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/rApt25P&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Got-it as a solution for all that really simple stuff that went missing at home. There were loads of little things, like iPhone charger cables or even Chapstick, that when forgotten or went missing, made life a little difficult. Sure, I could put a Bluetooth tracker on everything… but they’re expensive and a little clunky, especially for a $1.99 stick of Chapstick. The reality though, is that when stuff around the house goes missing, it’s just kinda annoying. At work, it’s a different ballgame. It costs money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works for businesses. Anyone at work sticks a label on shared things like tools, equipment, storage boxes, or packages to ship. By everyone just walking around as normal, in a warehouse, factory, or campus, the Got-it app picks up a beacon from the labels. The location of the item (within an approximate 10 meter zone) and who it’s been with, is then shared with the team if a coworker needs to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our integrated software stack makes it happen. We stumbled on a way to make our Bluetooth beacon firmware more reliably trigger background processing in phones, while still preserving ultra low power consumption. To do so, we ended up writing low-level embedded code, in less than 1.5KB and 135 Bytes RAM, to control the radio registers directly, without a BLE stack. Phones receive just enough information from our labels to enable a lean, low-power positioning algorithm we wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels we make ourselves, in house, here in the USA and UK. It’s a reel-to-reel manufacturing process (like making tape) that we developed. We’re printing circuits using coatings on thin films. We can create passive components, like inductors and capacitors using these inks and laminates by taking advantage of the thin geometry of the substrate itself. Our bill of materials is just a few lines long, so sourcing in China isn’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also came up with a way of electrochemically coating our circuit to form our own battery source that lasts over a year. That’s particularly why we decided to keep the manufacturing in-house. The process is fully automated, involving just the machine we built, and an operator. It just didn’t make sense to hand over the manufacturing IP to a contract manufacturer or outsource this to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing ourselves, locally, also helps in avoiding tariffs and contract manufacturing mark-ups. That’s key since the labels will be sold in volume at very small margins. The company makes money from a recurring SW model around asset and inventory tracking services. Note, the $99 pricing for ten labels on our website is just for the kit to get started today with your company team. Our target cost at scale will be less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just ran our first pre-production lot, and are pre-launching with some inventory to ship right away. It’d be great to learn your thoughts on how Got-its might work for you or applications we might be missing. We’re ramping our manufacturing line into higher volume production in the Spring of next year. Keep tabs on our twitter @realGot_it for launch announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance! Brian&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Evil Corp,’ a $100M Cybercrime Menace</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Justice Department&lt;/strong&gt; this month offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a Russian man indicted for allegedly orchestrating a vast, international cybercrime network that called itself “&lt;strong&gt;Evil Corp&lt;/strong&gt;” and stole roughly $100 million from businesses and consumers. As it happens, for several years KrebsOnSecurity closely monitored the day-to-day communications and activities of the accused and his accomplices. What follows is an insider’s look at the back-end operations of this gang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_49935&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-49935&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/yukabets.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;589&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Image: FBI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $5 million reward is being offered for 32 year-old &lt;strong&gt;Maksim V. Yakubets&lt;/strong&gt;, who the government says went by the nicknames “&lt;strong&gt;aqua&lt;/strong&gt;,” and “&lt;strong&gt;aquamo&lt;/strong&gt;,” among others. The feds allege Aqua led an elite cybercrime ring with at least 16 others who used advanced, custom-made strains of malware known as “&lt;strong&gt;JabberZeus&lt;/strong&gt;” and “&lt;strong&gt;Bugat&lt;/strong&gt;” (a.k.a. “&lt;strong&gt;Dridex&lt;/strong&gt;“) to steal banking credentials from employees at hundreds of small- to mid-sized companies in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2009 to the present, Aqua’s primary role in the conspiracy was recruiting and managing a continuous supply of unwitting or &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/experienced-money-mule-will-travel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;complicit&lt;/a&gt; accomplices to help Evil Corp. launder money stolen from their victims and transfer funds to members of the conspiracy based in Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe. These accomplices, known as “money mules,” are typically recruited via work-at-home job solicitations sent out by email and to people who have submitted their resumes to job search Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money mule recruiters tend to target people looking for part-time, remote employment, and the jobs usually involve little work other than receiving and forwarding bank transfers. People who bite on these offers sometimes receive small commissions for each successful transfer, but just as often end up getting stiffed out of a promised payday, and/or receiving a visit or threatening letter from law enforcement agencies that track such crime (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HITCHED TO A MULE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity first encountered Aqua’s work in 2008 as a reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. A source said they’d stumbled upon a way to intercept and read the daily online chats between Aqua and several other mule recruiters and malware purveyors who were stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars weekly from hacked businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source also discovered a pattern in the naming convention and appearance of several money mule recruitment Web sites being operated by Aqua. People who responded to recruitment messages were invited to create an account at one of these sites, enter personal and bank account data (mules were told they would be processing payments for their employer’s “programmers” based in Eastern Europe) and then log in each day to check for new messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each mule &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/busywork.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was given busy work or menial tasks&lt;/a&gt; for a few days or weeks prior to being asked to handle money transfers. I believe this was an effort to weed out unreliable money mules. After all, those who showed up late for work tended to cost the crooks a lot of money, as the victim’s bank would usually try to reverse any transfers that hadn’t already been withdrawn by the mules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_49940&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/westernco-r.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-49940&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/westernco-r.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;One of several sites set up by Aqua and others to recruit and manage money mules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time to transfer stolen funds, the recruiters would send a message through the mule site saying something like: “Good morning [mule name here]. Our client — XYZ Corp. — is sending you some money today. Please visit your bank now and withdraw this payment in cash, and then wire the funds in equal payments — minus your commission — to these three individuals in Eastern Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, in every case the company mentioned as the “client” was in fact a small business whose payroll accounts they’d already hacked into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it got interesting. Each of these mule recruitment sites had the same security weakness: Anyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/avcompanybackoffice.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;could register&lt;/a&gt;, and after logging in any user could view messages sent to and from all other users simply by changing a number in the browser’s address bar. As a result, it was trivial to automate the retrieval of messages sent to every money mule registered across dozens of these fake company sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, each day for several years my morning routine went as follows: Make a pot of coffee; shuffle over to the computer and view the messages Aqua and his co-conspirators had sent to their money mules over the previous 12-24 hours; look up the victim company names in Google; pick up the phone to warn each that they were in the process of being robbed by the Russian Cyber Mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My spiel on all of these calls was more or less the same: “You probably have no idea who I am, but here’s all my contact info and what I do. Your payroll accounts have been hacked, and you’re about to lose a great deal of money. You should contact your bank immediately and have them put a hold on any pending transfers before it’s too late. Feel free to call me back afterwards if you want more information about how I know all this, but for now please just call or visit your bank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_49939&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/amr-co.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-49939&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/amr-co.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Messages to and from a money mule working for Aqua’s crew, circa May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many instances, my call would come in just minutes or hours before an unauthorized payroll batch was processed by the victim company’s bank, and some of those notifications prevented what otherwise would have been enormous losses — often several times the amount of the organization’s normal weekly payroll. At some point I stopped counting how many tens of thousands of dollars those calls saved victims, but over several years it was probably in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as often, the victim company would suspect that I was somehow involved in the robbery, and soon after alerting them I would receive a call from an FBI agent or from a police officer in the victim’s hometown. Those were always interesting conversations. Needless to say, the victims that spun their wheels chasing after me usually suffered far more substantial financial losses (mainly because they delayed calling their financial institution until it was too late).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these notifications to Evil Corp.’s victims led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dozens of stories over several years&lt;/a&gt; about small businesses battling their financial institutions to recover their losses. I don’t believe I ever wrote about a single victim that wasn’t okay with my calling attention to their plight and to the sophistication of the threat facing other companies.&lt;span id=&quot;more-49835&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;LOW FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Justice Department, Yakubets/Aqua served as leader of Evil Corp. and was responsible for managing and supervising the group’s cybercrime activities in deploying and using the Jabberzeus and Dridex banking malware. The DOJ notes that prior to serving in this leadership role for Evil Corp, Yakubets was also directly associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Evgeniy “Slavik” Bogachev&lt;/a&gt;, a previously designated Russian cybercriminal responsible for the distribution of the Zeus, Jabber Zeus, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=gameover+zeus&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GameOver Zeus malware schemes&lt;/a&gt; who currently has a $3 million FBI bounty on his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_49974&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-49974&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bogachev.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Evgeniy M. Bogachev, in undated photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/why-were-the-russians-so-set-against-this-hacker-being-extradited/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in previous stories here&lt;/a&gt;, during times of conflict with Russia’s neighbors, Slavik was known to retool his crime machines to search for classified information on victim systems in regions of the world that were of strategic interest to the Russian government – particularly in Turkey and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cybercriminals are recruited to Russia’s national cause through a mix of coercion, payments and appeals to patriotic sentiment,” reads &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/06/russia_cyber_militia_analysis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a 2017 story&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; on security firm &lt;strong&gt;Cybereason&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cybereason.com/blog-russia-nation-state-hacking-the-countrys-dedicated-policy-of-strategic-ambiguity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Russian cybercrime scene. “Russia’s use of private contractors also has other benefits in helping to decrease overall operational costs, mitigating the risk of detection and gaining technical expertise that they cannot recruit directly into the government. Combining a cyber-militia with official state-sponsored hacking teams has created the most technically advanced and bold cybercriminal community in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Treasury Department&lt;/strong&gt; says Yukabets as of 2017 was working for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Russian FSB&lt;/a&gt;, one of Russia’s leading intelligence organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As of April 2018, Yakubets was in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the FSB,” notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department’s role in this action is key because it means the United States has now imposed economic sanctions on Yukabets and 16 accused associates, effectively freezing all property and interests of these persons (subject to U.S. jurisdiction) and making it a crime to transact with these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1223591/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criminal complaint against Yukabets&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) mentions several intercepted chat communications between Aqua and his alleged associates in which they puzzle over why KrebsOnSecurity seemed to know so much about their internal operations and victims. In the following chat conversations (translated from Russian), Aqua and others discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/an_odyssey_of_fraud_part_ii.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a story I wrote for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 about their theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars from the payroll accounts of Bullitt County, Ky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tank: [Are you] there?&lt;br /&gt;indep: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;indep: Greetings.&lt;br /&gt;tank: http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/an_odyssey_of_fraud_part_ii.html#more&lt;br /&gt;tank: This is still about me.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Originator: BULLITT COUNTY FISCAL Company: Bullitt County Fiscal Court&lt;br /&gt;tank: He is the account from which we cashed.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Today someone else send this news.&lt;br /&gt;tank: I’m reading and thinking: Let me take a look at history. For some reason this name is familiar.&lt;br /&gt;tank: I’m on line and I’ll look. Ah, here is this shit.&lt;br /&gt;indep: How are you?&lt;br /&gt;tank: Did you get my announcements?&lt;br /&gt;indep: Well, I congratulate [you].&lt;br /&gt;indep: This is just fuck when they write about you in the news.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Whose [What]?&lt;br /&gt;tank: 😀&lt;br /&gt;indep: Too much publicity is not needed.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Well, so nobody knows who they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tank: Well, nevertheless, they were writing about us.&lt;br /&gt;aqua: So because of whom did they lock Western Union for Ukraine?&lt;br /&gt;aqua: Tough shit.&lt;br /&gt;tank: *************Originator: BULLITT COUNTY FISCAL Company: Bullitt&lt;br /&gt;County Fiscal Court&lt;br /&gt;aqua: So?&lt;br /&gt;aqua: This is the court system.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Shit.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Yes&lt;br /&gt;aqua: This is why they fucked [nailed?] several drops.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Yes, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;aqua: Well, fuck. Hackers: It’s true they stole a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At roughly the same time, one of Aqua’s crew had a chat with Slavik, who used the nickname “lucky12345” at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tank: Are you there?&lt;br /&gt;tank: This is what they damn wrote about me.&lt;br /&gt;tank: http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/an_odyssey_of_fraud_part_ii.html#more&lt;br /&gt;tank: I’ll take a quick look at history&lt;br /&gt;tank: Originator: BULLITT COUNTY FISCAL Company: Bullitt County Fiscal Court&lt;br /&gt;tank: Well, you got [it] from that cash-in.&lt;br /&gt;lucky12345: From 200K?&lt;br /&gt;tank: Well, they are not the right amounts and the cash out from that account was shitty.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Levak was written there.&lt;br /&gt;tank: Because now the entire USA knows about Zeus.&lt;br /&gt;tank: 😀&lt;br /&gt;lucky12345: It’s fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 13, 2009, one of the Jabberzeus gang’s money mule recruiters –- a crook who used the pseudonym “Jim Rogers” — somehow learned about something I hadn’t shared beyond a few trusted friends at that point: That The Washington Post had eliminated my job in the process of merging the newspaper’s Web site (where I worked at the time) with the dead tree edition. The following is an exchange between Jim Rogers and the above-quoted “tank”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jim_rogers: There is a rumor that our favorite (Brian) didn’t get his contract extension at Washington Post. We are giddily awaiting confirmation 🙂 Good news expected exactly by the New Year! Besides us no one reads his column 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tank: Mr. Fucking Brian Fucking Kerbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Aqua would divulge in an encrypted chat that his crew was working directly with the Zeus author (Slavik/Lucky12345), but that they found him abrasive and difficult to tolerate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dimka: I read about the king of seas, was it your handy work?&lt;br /&gt;aqua: what are you talking about? show me&lt;br /&gt;dimka: zeus&lt;br /&gt;aqua: 🙂&lt;br /&gt;aqua: yes, we are using it right now&lt;br /&gt;aqua: its developer sits with us on the system&lt;br /&gt;dimka: it’s a popular thing&lt;br /&gt;aqua: but, he, fucker, annoyed the hell out of everyone, doesn’t want to write bypass of interactives (scans) and trojan penetration 35-40%, bitch&lt;br /&gt;aqua: yeah, shit&lt;br /&gt;aqua: we need better&lt;br /&gt;aqua: http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix read it 🙂 here you find almost everything about us 🙂&lt;br /&gt;dimka: I think everything will be slightly different, if you think so&lt;br /&gt;aqua: we, in this system, the big dog, the rest on the system are doing small crap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that month, Aqua bemoaned even more publicity about their work, pointing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/03/crooks-crank-up-volume-of-e-banking-attacks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a KrebsOnSecurity story&lt;/a&gt; about a sophisticated attack in which their malware not only intercepted a one-time password needed to log in to the victim’s bank account, but even modified the bank’s own Web site as displayed in the victim’s browser to point to a phony customer support number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the fake bank phone number was what tipped off the victim company employee. In this instance, the victim’s bank — Fifth Third Bank (referred to as “53” in the chat below) was able to claw back the money stolen by Aqua’s money mules, but not funds that were taken via fraudulent international wire transfers. The cybercriminals in this chat also complain they will need a newly-obfuscated version of their malware due to public exposure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aqua: tomorrow, everything should work.&lt;br /&gt;aqua: fuck, we need to find more socks for spam.&lt;br /&gt;aqua: okay, so tomorrow Petro [&lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;another conspirator who went by the nickname Petr0vich&lt;/a&gt;] will give us a [new] .exe&lt;br /&gt;jtk: ok&lt;br /&gt;jim_rogers: this one doesn’t work&lt;br /&gt;jim_rogers: http://www.krebsonsecurity.com/2010/03/crooks-crank-up-volume-of-e-banking-attacks/&lt;br /&gt;jim_rogers: here it’s written about my transfer from 53. How I made a number of wires like it said there. And a woman burnt the deal because of a fake phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ANTI-MULE INITIATIVE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with the indictments against Evil Corp, the Justice Department joined with officials from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Europol&lt;/a&gt; to execute a law enforcement action and public awareness campaign to combat money mule activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More than 90% of money mule transactions identified through the European Money Mule Actions are linked to cybercrime,” Europol wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/money-muling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; about the action. “The illegal money often comes from criminal activities like phishing, malware attacks, online auction fraud, e-commerce fraud, business e-mail compromise (BEC) and CEO fraud, romance scams, holiday fraud (booking fraud) and many others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOJ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-landmark-money-mule-initiative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; U.S. law enforcement disrupted mule networks that spanned from Hawaii to Florida and from Alaska to Maine. Actions were taken to halt the conduct of over 600 domestic money mules, including 30 individuals who were criminally charged for their roles in receiving victim payments and providing the fraud proceeds to accomplices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_49952&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/europol-mm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-49952&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/europol-mm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Some tips from Europol on how to spot money mule recruitment scams dressed up as legitimate job offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to see more public education about the damage that money mules inflict, because without them most of these criminal schemes simply fall apart. Aside from helping to launder funds from banking trojan victims, money mules often are instrumental in fleecing elderly people taken in by various online confidence scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also great to see the U.S. government finally wielding its most powerful weapon against cybercriminals based in Russia and other safe havens for such activity: Economic sanctions that severely restrict cybercriminals’ access to ill-gotten gains and the ability to launder the proceeds of their crimes by investing in overseas assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;Thank god for &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 FoItC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Internal link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;http://kotaku.com/angered-game-developer-sues-game-critic-jim-sterling-fo-1765484317&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/angered-game-developer-sues-game-critic-jim-sterling-fo-1765484317&quot;&gt;Jim Sterling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a game critic whose recent YouTube antics forced YouTube’s copyright system to eat itself alive. Here’s how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;As you may already know, YouTube has something called “Content ID,” which is a system that theoretically allows users to identify and manage their videos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;Basically, once a video is online, viewers can put a digital fingerprint on it. If another YouTube channel uploads a video, and the system believes that the new video has the same digital fingerprint, then the new video gains a Content ID claim. The owners of the original Content ID can then gain some ownership over the new video, and YouTube allows them to monetize the video for themselves, or sometimes outright block it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The problem is, Content ID is often abused by YouTubers who try to lay claim to footage that isn’t really theirs. It’s especially difficult to fight off Content ID claims from big companies, who may not be receptive to the woes of a smaller unknown channel. Fighting against a Content ID claim is also risky, because if the dispute isn’t resolved amicably, a channel may gain what is known as a “strike.” One strike is enough to strip a channel of certain YouTube privileges, annoyingly enough. Three strikes will cause YouTube to terminate your channel outright.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;In short, the system is pretty terrible because not only can it be gamed easily, Content ID often seems to serve the needs of big corporations rather than the common YouTube populace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, game critic Jim Sterling uploaded an episode of his Jimquisition series, where he skewers the recently released Wii U game &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Zero&lt;/em&gt;. According to Jim Sterling, Nintendo’s love for the idea of innovation can sometimes jeopardize games that don’t need to reinvent the wheel in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The entire episode is worth a watch based on Sterling’s well-reasoned arguments. But the thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sets it apart is a revelation near the end of the video, where Sterling explains why he makes such ample use of footage that is completely unrelated to what he actually discusses throughout the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;“You may have noticed this week’s video had footage from &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid V, Grand Theft Auto V,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Beyond: Two Souls&lt;/em&gt; in it,” Sterling said. “Now, there’s a reason for that. The reason is Nintendo. Because I’m talking about a Nintendo game this week, I’ve used Nintendo game footage, and that means Nintendo will attempt to monetize this video even though the point of the Jimquisition is to be ad-free, thanks to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 FoItC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;External link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://www.patreon.com/jimquisition?ty=h&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/jimquisition?ty=h&quot;&gt;your lovely help on Patreon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;So, Jim Sterling hatched a plan. He went back through his older videos, and took note of what footage got slammed with a Content ID claim in the past. He then went ahead and copied that same flagged footage, and stuck it into his new video. The self-sabotage was intentional: Sterling wanted to fuck with the Content ID system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;“I figured every time I talk about Nintendo, I’m going to throw in other stuff that gets flagged by Content ID, and just watch the corporations battle it out,” Sterling said. His hope was that by pulling this stunt, he could stop any company from monetizing the video at all, since it wouldn’t be clear who really owned the footage in the first place. And if anybody did manage to monetize the video, they’d probably only get peanuts for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The scheme panned out just the way he thought it would, Jim Sterling tells &lt;em&gt;Kotaku.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;I can confirm it works,” Jim Sterling said over email. “It’s worked several times before. WMG tried to monetize the video for the Erasure music, but couldn’t because Nintendo and Take-Two had set their ContentID in this particular case to Not Monetized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper sc-1eow4w5-2 gfolHV&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot; data-syndicationrights=&quot;false&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-hydration-wrapper sc-1eow4w5-3 iJyiXs&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;kes0hxwx6nrtvd5pmgfd&quot; data-format=&quot;Jpg&quot; data-height=&quot;347&quot; data-default-transform=&quot;UncroppedWideExtraLarge&quot; data-width=&quot;871&quot; data-relative=&quot;false&quot; data-show-background=&quot;true&quot; data-alt=&quot;Illustration for article titled Game Critic Uses Brilliant Workaround For YouTubes Copyright Bullshit&quot; data-poster-src=&quot;&quot; data-anim-src=&quot;&quot; data-cropped=&quot;false&quot; class=&quot;dv4r5q-1 hEuYft&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;“I discovered this by accident a few months back when competing claims from Sony and Konami meant no ads ended up running on my video. Pretty good workaround for someone trying to keep my series ad-free, even if it means you have to actively try and ‘infringe copyright’ to exercise your fair use rights.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;Ha. Way to be clever, Jim Sterling. But here’s hoping that one day, YouTube’s copyright system isn’t so bad that it necessitates ridiculous workarounds like this one. One can dream, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad bxm4mm-4 liWXlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile bxm4mm-5 eZvXLs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>WebAssembly becomes a W3C Recommendation</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) brings a new language to the Web as WebAssembly becomes a W3C Recommendation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;//www.w3.org/StyleSheets/press.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;134.43659400243&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;W3C&quot; src=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home&quot; height=&quot;48&quot; width=&quot;72&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;For immediate release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Following HTML, CSS and JavaScript, WebAssembly becomes the fourth language for the Web which allows code to run in the browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;nav&quot; id=&quot;below&quot;&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en#testimonials&quot;&gt;testimonials from W3C Members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;logo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/logos/web-assembly-logo-black-150px.png&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; alt=&quot;webassembly black and white logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.w3.org/&lt;/a&gt; — 5 December 2019 — The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Core Specification&lt;/a&gt; is now an official web standard, launching a powerful new language for the Web. WebAssembly is a safe, portable, low-level format designed for efficient execution and compact representation of code on modern processors including in a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The arrival of WebAssembly expands the range of applications that can be achieved by simply using Open Web Platform technologies. In a world where machine learning and Artificial Intelligence become more and more common, it is important to enable high performance applications on the Web, without compromising the safety of the users&lt;/em&gt;,” declared Philippe Le Hégaret, W3C Project Lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High-performance applications relying on a low-level infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, WebAssembly is a virtual instruction set architecture that enables high-performance applications on the Web, and can be employed in many other environments. There are multiple implementations of WebAssembly, including browsers and stand-alone systems. WebAssembly can be used for applications like video and audio codecs, graphics and 3D, multi-media and games, cryptographic computations or portable language implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WebAssembly enhances Web Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly improves Web performance and power consumption by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run as native compiled code. In other words, WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to JavaScript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and its byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming. A web page can start executing while the rest of the code downloads. Network and API access occurs through accompanying JavaScript libraries. The security model is identical to that of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future versions already in the works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wasm/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Working Group&lt;/a&gt; and the companion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/&quot;&gt;Community Group&lt;/a&gt;, where requirements gathering and language development take place, are already working on a range of features for future versions of the standard, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Threading&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Threads provide the benefits of shared-memory multi-threading and atomic memory accesses.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Fixed-width &lt;abbr title=&quot;Single Instruction Multiple Data&quot;&gt;SIMD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Vector operations that execute loops in parallel.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Reference types&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Allow WebAssembly code to directly reference host objects.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md&quot;&gt;longer-term projects&lt;/a&gt; including several aimed at improving the usability and availability of WebAssembly. For example garbage collection, debugging interfaces, and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), which is a set of modules for low-level system functionality such as file and network access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly joins the many W3C standards that define an Open Web Platform for application development with unprecedented potential to enable developers to build powerful, interactive experiences that are available on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all foundational Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and privacy. W3C also provides the standards that undergird the infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas such as entertainment, communications, digital publishing, and financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for free and under the groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy. For our work to make online videos more accessible with captions and subtitles, W3C received a 2016 Emmy Award. And for its work to standardize a Full TV Experience on the Web, W3C received a 2019 Emmy Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3C's vision for &quot;One Web&quot; brings together thousands of dedicated technologists representing more than 400 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List&quot;&gt;Member organizations&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of industry sectors. W3C is jointly hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csail.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (MIT CSAIL) in the United States, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ercim.eu/&quot;&gt;European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; (ERCIM) headquartered in France, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keio.ac.jp/&quot;&gt;Keio University&lt;/a&gt; in Japan and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/&quot;&gt;Beihang University&lt;/a&gt; in China.

<title>German BSI withholds Truecrypt security report</title>
<link>https://www.golem.de/news/encryption-software-german-bsi-withholds-truecrypt-security-report-1912-145552.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.golem.de/news/encryption-software-german-bsi-withholds-truecrypt-security-report-1912-145552.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;gpar1&quot;&gt;The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has kept a detailed examination of the encryption software Truecrypt secret for nine years. On more than 400 pages the documents contain a detailed description of the architecture of the encryption tool, list various security problems and make recommendations on how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;gpar2&quot;&gt;Golem.de &lt;a href=&quot;https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/true-crypt-unterlagen-und-backdoor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-external-url&quot;&gt;learned about the existence of these documents via an entry&lt;/a&gt; on the web plattform &lt;em&gt;&quot;Frag Den Staat&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (translated &lt;em&gt;&quot;ask the state&quot;&lt;/em&gt;). On this web page citizens can send requests to government agencies according to the German freedom of information law. A user sent a generic request to BSI asking about all investigations of Truecrypt they may possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar3&quot;&gt;The BSI sent several documents that according to their date were created in 2010 and that contain a detailed analysis of Truecrypt. However BSI told the person that the documents are copyright protected and he is not allowed to publish them. Golem.de therefore requested the documents themselves and got them after some time - also with the remark that they must not be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar4&quot;&gt;It is a common strategy by government agencies to prevent the publication of documents revealed by freedom of information law requests due to copyright. The platform &lt;em&gt;&quot;Frag Den Staat&quot;&lt;/em&gt; has for example been in a legal conflict with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golem.de/news/frag-den-staat-glyphosat-gutachten-darf-wieder-veroeffentlicht-werden-1907-142373.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-internal-url golem-url-news&quot;&gt;German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) about the publication of a report on the herbicide Glyphosate&lt;/a&gt;. The BSI also prevented the publication of an earlier report on cryptographic libraries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golem.de/news/kryptobibliotheken-die-geheime-kryptosoftware-studie-des-bsi-1803-133468.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-internal-url golem-url-news&quot;&gt;referring to its copyright&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;supplementary&quot; id=&quot;job-market&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stellenmarkt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;

Bertrandt Services GmbH, Berlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;

operational services GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG, Braunschweig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cpxl.golem.de/gif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2F&amp;amp;d=1576543142&amp;amp;f=ev&amp;amp;v=d&amp;amp;t=ad%2Fjobs2018kw10&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;gpar5&quot;&gt;The Truecrypt documents contain a remark that it is an item of classified information, but that remark has been striked through. The content is noteworthy, because it shows that BSI had plenty of information about the security of Truecrypt and specific security problems since a long time. Despite various discussions about the security of Truecrypt that erupted after the Snowden affair they apparently decided not to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BSI sends complete documents only after multiple requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar6&quot;&gt;The five documents are numbered from AP2 to AP6. AP1 was notably missing. After asking BSI they said: &lt;em&gt;&quot;AP1 is a research and overview of what functionality existing hard drive encryption products on the market implement (including the Windows and the Linux version of Truecrypt). Since this is not an 'investigation' of the 'Truecrypt' program, we saw this document as not covered by the Freedom of Information Act request.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar7&quot;&gt;We then requested to receive this document as well. It is surprising that BSI came to the conclusion that this document is not an &lt;em&gt;&quot;investigation&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (in German &lt;em&gt;&quot;Untersuchung&quot;&lt;/em&gt;) of Truecrypt, because the title of the Document starts with &lt;em&gt;&quot;Truecrypt Untersuchung&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar8&quot;&gt;Even then the documents were incomplete. The documents contain multiple references that mention that attacks are explained in more detail in AP7. After multiple requests Golem.de also got that document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Truecrypt was published by anonymous developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar9&quot;&gt;The software Truecrypt has an interesting history. The program was created by anonymous developers. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golem.de/news/paul-le-roux-der-truecrypt-erfinder-ein-drogenbaron-und-auftragskiller-1603-120058.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-internal-url golem-url-news&quot;&gt;investigations by journalist Evan Ratliff&lt;/a&gt; the drug dealer Paul Le Roux was involved in the development. Truecrypt gives users a relatively easy way to locally encrypt files in an encrypted data container. It also offers the option to encrypt whole disk drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar10&quot;&gt;The license of the Truecrypt code is controversial. While the code is publicly available, the license contains some restrictions that cause it to not fall under the definition of free Software or Open Source. Therefore many Linux distributions don't have official Truecrypt packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gfpop&quot;&gt;In 2013 the cryptographer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golem.de/news/truecrypt-ein-sicherheitscheck-fuer-das-verschluesselungstool-1310-102245.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-internal-url golem-url-news&quot;&gt;Matthew Green started collecting donations to fund a security test of Truecrypt&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the IT security professional Kenneth White he founded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencryptoaudit.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-external-url&quot;&gt;Open Crypto Audit Project&lt;/a&gt;. The money came in quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;27.943480016149&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I read about 25 books this year, here are the top 10 I look forward to reading in 2020, many of them informed by my favorites of 2019:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari - I read Sapiens this year and really enjoyed it. I just started this today one so I may finish that before the end of the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman - I like books that make me think and from what I've heard, this will definitely do the trick. I read Factfulness this year and this was a suggested follow-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker - I've gotten really into natural languages since I've lived outside my country of origin for the last 2 and a half years and I've heard good things about this book being an entry point into linguistics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Sword of Destiny by Andrzej Sapkowski - With the new Witcher show coming out on Netflix I finally went back and beat The Witcher 3 then read the first book, The Last Wish. It was enjoyable enough that I want to keep going with the series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Educated by Tara Westover - Was convinced by Bill Gate's blog this is worthwhile. I'm a teacher so it wasn't hard to convince me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Robot Builder's Bonanza by Gordon McComb - I've been asked to teach a robotics course next year and this one seems to be The Book everyone recommends to dive into robotics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Divided by Partition: United by Resilience by Mallika Ahluwalia - I recently visited the Partition Museum in Amritsar, Punjab, India and purchased this book there to learn about more stories about people impacted by this event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Shocken - I just read Code by Petzold and it was one of my favorite books. Even though I studied Computer Science in University and most of the concepts weren't new to me, it was such a fun experience mentally &quot;building&quot; a computer from relays/transistors to logic gates and up to assemblers, compilers, and interpreters. I want to keep going with this and jump into the Nand2Tetris online course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Annotated Turing by Charles Petzold - Again, I loved Petzold's Code so I looked up other books he wrote and this one looks great. I've never actually read Turing's work so I'm excited to have some background and explanation to help me not just read the words but grasp their significance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;ZACH-LIKE by Zachtronics - I played through several Zachtronics games this year (TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum) so I can't wait to dive into some of the thinking behind creating these and similar games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
