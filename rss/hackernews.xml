<title>On Being a Principal Engineer</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.dbsmasher.com/2019/01/28/on-being-a-principal-engineer.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-managers-path&quot;&gt;The manager’s path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491973897/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_Aq9tCbSNCEHAA&quot;&gt;The Manager’s Path&lt;/a&gt; by the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skamille&quot;&gt;Camille Fournier&lt;/a&gt; when it first came out. At the time, I was a senior Database Engineer aspiring to become a principal engineer in my organization. At SendGrid, principal engineer and principal engineer 2 are manager and director level roles respectively without having human direct reports. We had just overhauled the career ladder to provide a full technical ladder, and I now had the opportunity to grow that did not require going into people management. It is not that I disliked managers or that I think it is easy work. To the contrary, I very much appreciate the complexity of engineering management work but I felt that I wanted to strengthen my technical expertise and solidify my career as an individual contributor before considering going fully into people management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, 2 years later, I have been a principal engineer for a year. I am now closer to more technical strategy decisions than I used to be and I decided to read the book again. The title of the book and its stated goal might be laying out the path in engineering management up to senior leadership, but reading it made it clear to me that the book is also of great value to individual contributors to help explain what all these titles mean, what each layer of management is supposed to focus on, and how engineering concerns converge ultimately with business concerns and crystallize into a strategy for a technical organization. I also realized that while I am still an individual contributor, the principal engineer role carries enough cross-organization work, and enough people skills, that it is much closer to management than it may seem without engineers reporting directly to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;career-ladders-and-the-myth-of-a-flat-org&quot;&gt;Career ladders and the myth of a flat org&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It surprises me that many shops still claim to have a ‘flat org’ or claim that they do not believe in titles. I have heard it said about data stores that ‘all databases have schemas…even the ones that say they do not’ and I think the same applies to organizations that are larger than a small handful of individuals. They may claim or even believe that they are not encumbered by the politics of titles and organizational hierarchy but that simply means that the power structure is there and implied and not based on clear milestones or competencies either. When companies’ engineering teams grow past a handful, the engineering leadership has to document explicitly what they consider are the competencies of a senior engineer, not leave that up to interpretation. Implied competencies are easily colored by personal bias, both implicit and explicit. And these biases are a quick way to lose competent engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;principal-not-senior-senior&quot;&gt;Principal. Not senior senior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding ‘Senior’ to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like ‘principal’ or ‘staff’ engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels. It is an IC position that is on a different playing field as it involves competencies that no longer apply to only technical prowess. For an engineer to get to the Principal Engineer level, there needs to be cross organizational collaborative signals, there needs to be a clear understanding of architecture and design decisions that go far beyond the immediate technical area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-force-multiplier&quot;&gt;A force multiplier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I became a principal engineer, it quickly became clear to me that my job involved a lot more than closing tickets and writing code to achieve things. Yes I am still a maker not a manager and I do not have anyone reporting to me but my new position now requires leadership duties that are best not left implicit or not handled with the same outcomes oriented focus as my past coding assignments. One of the most important competencies of a principal engineer is to become a force multiplier. This is a much more mature definition of ‘10x engineer’ than the Silicon Valley cargo cult likes to use. A PE does not produce 10x the features or fix 10x the tech debt tickets. A truly valuable PE makes their whole team better by advocating for best practices, gently reminding people of why the processes we have exist, and helping the less experienced engineers find ways to ‘level up’. A good PE can speak to technical aspects of the product, connect planned work to business strategy and to what makes the company more successful and maybe most importantly, have the interpersonal skills to influence others around them towards these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why promoting any engineer to PE without clear skills in more than just ‘the code’ would be a disservice to the team and a bad signal for the rest of the organization as to what things management actually values when it comes to the non manager career track. If you want to watch and see how the ‘brilliant jerk’ anecdote came to be, it is those promotions to senior IC titles based solely on code output and not all the value that inter human skills can bring into getting large numbers of humans rowing in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cheerleader-recruiter&quot;&gt;Cheerleader, recruiter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the book especially focuses on explaining is “what does that person do, anyway?”. It lays that out by showing when/at what point a ‘manager’ changes focus from day to day tactical to the long term strategic. And few things are more strategic to a company than its ability to recruit great engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers carry a responsibility towards recruiting and representing the company well. That’s an obvious fact. As a principal engineer, recruitment is one of your responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working at the senior engineer level, the focus is more on “getting tickets/projects done with little to no direction” and “being proactive in fixing tech debt or helping solve problems/bugs”. But once i became a principal, it became clear that by virtue of being one of a few, i now carried a larger impact on morale, organization culture and even on recruiting and representing my engineering organization outside of the company. Behaviours I display, either at the office or at tech events, are now a display of the behaviours my company rewards. My behavior is a signal to anyone who may consider working in my organization of whether we align in values or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;manager&quot;&gt;Manager?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I was where a lot of senior engineers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-06-female-managerial-roles-unintended-consequences.html&quot;&gt;maybe more the women than the men&lt;/a&gt;) tend to be:. at a fork in the road. Do I become a people manager or do I stay in a technical IC role and focus on solving technical problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trick question! Once at a certain level, all problems are solved by people. There is no such thing as ‘purely technical problems’. In fact, this is the level where one wishes more problems were purely code because we can make code do a lot of things. Making people do anything is harder and influencing people to do what we want is harder still. This is what principal engineering is about. The role is far less about solving intricate technology problems (although there is that too) and more about being a good influence, convincing the rest of the technical team why Thing A should be solved with plan Foo and not plan Bar. There is a lot of solving for other people motivations, finding the right message for each audience while still working towards the business goals at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year and a half working as a principal engineer have been eye opening into all the work that goes into getting a large group of humans all rowing in the same direction for the business to achieve planned goals. It is no small feat that is further complicated with our ever growing, ever complex systems of scale. I do not know whether my experience as a principal engineer will some day translate into becoming an engineering manager someday. Maybe it will. I do know that if I ever made the move to managing people that my time as a principal engineer has taught me plenty that I may have missed out on when focusing only on senior engineer competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whereistanya&quot;&gt;Tanya Reilly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/log1kal&quot;&gt;Sean Kilgore&lt;/a&gt; for both being great examples and for their excellent feedback on this. And to Camille Fournier for writing that book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wayland misconceptions debunked</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2019/02/10/Wayland-misconceptions-debunked.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2019/02/10/Wayland-misconceptions-debunked.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This article has been on my backburner for a while, but it seems Wayland FUD is making the news again recently, so I’ve bumped up the priority a bit. For those new to my blog, I am the maintainer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots&quot;&gt;wlroots&lt;/a&gt;, a library which implements much of the functionality required of a Wayland compositor and is arguably the single most influential project in Wayland right now; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://swaywm.org&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Wayland compositor which is nearing version 1.0. Let’s go over some of the common misconceptions I hear about Wayland and why they’re wrong. Feel free to pick and choose the misconceptions you believe to read and disregard the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art of hating Wayland has become a cult affair. We don’t need to put ourselves into camps at war. Please try not to read this article through the lens of anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-isnt-more-secure-look-at-this-keylogger&quot;&gt;Wayland isn’t more secure, look at this keylogger!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger&quot;&gt;unfortunate GitHub project&lt;/a&gt; called “Wayland keylogger” whose mode of operation is using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; to intercept calls to the libwayland shared library and record keypresses from it. The problem with this “critique” is stated in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file, though most don’t read past the title of the repository. Wayland is only &lt;em&gt;one part&lt;/em&gt; of an otherwise secure system. Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; is effectively equivalent to rewriting client programs to log keys themselves, and any program which is in a position to do this has already won. If I rephrased this as “Wayland can be keylogged, assuming the attacker can sneak some evil code into your .bashrc”, the obviousness of this truth should become immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have also told me that they can log keys by opening &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dev/input/*&lt;/code&gt; files and reading input events. They’re right! Try it yourself: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo libinput debug-events&lt;/code&gt;. The catch should also be immediately obvious: ask yourself why this needs to be run with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-screenshotscapture&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support screenshots/capture!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland/blob/master/protocol/wayland.xml&quot;&gt;core Wayland protocol&lt;/a&gt; does not define a mechanism for taking screenshots. Here’s another thing it doesn’t define: how to open application windows, like gedit and Firefox. The Wayland protocol is very conservative and general purpose, and is built with use-cases other than desktop systems in mind. To this end it only implements the lowest common denominator, and leaves the rest to protocol extensions. There is a process for defining, implementing, maturing, and standardizing these extensions, though the last part is in need of improvements - which are under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two protocols for the purpose of screenshots and screen recording, which are developed by wlroots and supported by a strong majority of Wayland compositors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/blob/master/protocol/wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1.xml&quot;&gt;screencopy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/blob/master/protocol/wlr-export-dmabuf-unstable-v1.xml&quot;&gt;dmabuf-export&lt;/a&gt;, respectively for copying pixels (best for screenshots) and exporting DMA buffers (best for real-time video capture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches to this endorsed by different camps in Wayland: these Wayland protocols, and a dbus protocol based on Pipewire. Progress is being made on making these approaches talk to each other via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr&quot;&gt;xdg-desktop-portal&lt;/a&gt;, which will make just about every client and compositor work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-have-a-secondary-clipboard&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t have a secondary clipboard!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary clipboard support (aka primary selection) was first implemented as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/blob/master/protocol/gtk-primary-selection.xml&quot;&gt;gtk-primary-selection&lt;/a&gt; and was recently standardized as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/master/unstable/primary-selection/primary-selection-unstable-v1.xml&quot;&gt;wp-primary-selection&lt;/a&gt;. It is supported by nearly all Wayland compositors and clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-clipboard-managers&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support clipboard managers!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard&quot;&gt;wl-clipboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-isnt-suitable-for-embedded-devices&quot;&gt;Wayland isn’t suitable for embedded devices!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that Wayland isn’t supported on embedded devices or require proprietary blobs to work. This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; untrue. Firstly, Wayland is a protocol: the &lt;em&gt;implementations&lt;/em&gt; are the ones that need support from drivers, and a Wayland implementation could be written for basically any driver. You could implement Wayland by writing Wayland protocol messages on pieces of paper, passing them to your friend in class, and having them draw your window on their notebook with a pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, this is also untrue of the implementations. wlroots, which contains the most popular Wayland rendering backend, implements KMS+DRM+GBM, which is supported by all open source graphics drivers, and uses GLESv2, which is the most broadly supported graphics implementation, including on embedded (which is what the “E” stands for) and most older hardware. For ancient hardware, writing an fbdev backend is totally possible and I’d merge it in wlroots if someone put in the time. Writing a more modern KMS+DRM+GBM implementation for that hardware is equally possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-have-network-transparency&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t have network transparency!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually true! But it’s not as bad as it’s made out to be. Here’s why: X11 forwarding works on Wayland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Yep: all mainstream desktop Wayland compositors have support for &lt;strong&gt;Xwayland&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an implementation of the X11 server which translates X11 to Wayland, for backwards compatibility. X11 forwarding works with it! So if you use X11 forwarding on Xorg today, your workflow will work on Wayland unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Wayland itself is not network transparent. The reason for this is that some protocols rely on file descriptors for transferring information quickly or in bulk. One example is GPU buffers, so that the Wayland compositor can render clients without copying data on the GPU - which improves performance dramatically. However, little about Wayland is inherently network &lt;em&gt;opaque&lt;/em&gt;. Things like sending pixel buffers to the compositor are already abstracted on Wayland and a network-backed implementation could be easily made. The problem is that no one seems to really care: all of the people who want network transparency drank the anti-Wayland kool-aid instead of showing up to put the work in. If you want to implement this, though, we’re here and ready to support you! Drop by the wlroots &lt;a href=&quot;https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sway-devel&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; and we’re prepared to help you implement this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-remote-desktop&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support remote desktop!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is also true, but work is ongoing. Several of the pieces are in place: screen capture and keyboard simulation are there. If an interested developer wants to add pointer device simulation and tie it all together with librdesktop, that would be a great boon to the Wayland ecosystem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sway-devel&quot;&gt;We’re waiting to help!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-requires-client-side-decorations&quot;&gt;Wayland requires client side decorations!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was actually true for a long time, but there was deep contention in the Wayland ecosystem over this matter. We fought long and hard over this and we now have a protocol for negotiating client- vs server-side decorations, which is now fairly broadly supported, including among some of its opponents. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-hotkey-daemons&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support hotkey daemons!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a feature, not a bug, but you’re free to disagree once you hear the rationale. There are lots of problems with the idea of hotkey daemons as it exists on X. What if there’s a conflict between several clients who want the same hotkey? What if the user wants to pick a different hotkey? On top of this, designing a protocol carefully to avoid keylogging concerns makes it more difficult still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I’ve been encouraging client developers who want hotkeys to instead use some kind of IPC mechanism and a control binary. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mako&lt;/code&gt;, a notification daemon, allows you to dismiss notifications by running the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;makoctl dismiss&lt;/code&gt; command. Users are then encouraged to use the compositor’s own keybinding facilities to execute this command. This is more flexible even outside of keybinding - the user might want to execute this behavior through a script, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want hotkeys, you should start the discussion for standardizing a protocol. It will be an uphill battle but I believe that a protocol which addresses everyone’s concerns is theoretically possible. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; have to step up, though: no one working on Wayland today seems to care. We are mostly volunteers working for free in our spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-nvidia&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support Nvidia!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Nvidia doesn’t support us. There are three standard APIs which are implemented by all graphics drivers in the Linux kernel: DRM (display resource management), KMS (kernel mode setting), and GBM (generic buffer management). All three are necessary for most Wayland compositors. Only the first two are implemented by the Nvidia proprietary driver. In order to support Nvidia, Wayland compositors need to add code resembling this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-c highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvidia&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;proprietary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* several thousand lines of code */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* several thousand lines of code */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s terrible! On top of that, we cannot debug the proprietary driver, we cannot send fixes upstream, and we cannot read the code to understand its behavior. The mesa code (where much of the important code for many drivers lives) is a frequent object of study among Wayland compositor developers. We cannot do this with the proprietary drivers, and it doesn’t even implement the APIs it needs to. They claim to be working on a replacement for GBM which they hope will satisfy everyone’s concerns, but 52 commits in 3 years with over a year of inactivity isn’t a great sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boot, Nvidia is a bad actor on Linux. Compare the talks at FOSDEM 2018 from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/nouveau/&quot;&gt;nouveau developers&lt;/a&gt; (the open source Nvidia driver) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/amd_graphics/&quot;&gt;AMDGPU developers&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; AMD driver - also open source). The Nouveau developers discuss all of the ways that Nvidia makes their lives difficult, up to and including &lt;em&gt;signed firmwares&lt;/em&gt;. AMDGPU instead talks about the process of upstreaming their driver, discuss their new open source Vulkan driver, and how the community can contribute - and this was presented by paid AMD staff. I met Intel employees at XDC who were working on a continuous integration system wherein Intel offers a massive Intel GPU farm to Mesa developers free-of-charge for working on the open source driver. Nvidia is clearly a force for bad on the Linux scene and for open source in general, and the users who reward this by spending oodles of cash on their graphics cards are not exactly in my good graces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in short, people asking for Nvidia proprietary driver support are asking the wrong people to spend hundreds of hours working for free to write and maintain an implementation for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; driver which represents a harmful force on the Linux ecosystem and a headache for developers trying to work with it. With respect, my answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wayland-doesnt-support-gaming&quot;&gt;Wayland doesn’t support gaming!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-person shooters, among other kinds of games, require “locking” the pointer to their window. This requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/master/unstable/pointer-constraints/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1.xml&quot;&gt;a protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which was standardized in 2015. Adoption has been slower, but it landed in wlroots several months ago and support was added to sway a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, some of these things have been true. Some have never been true. It takes time to replace a 30-year incumbent. To be fair, some of these points are true on GNOME and KDE, but none are inherently problems with the Wayland protocol. wlroots is a dominating force in the Wayland ecosystem and the tide is clearly moving our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I want to note is that Xorg still works. If you find your needs aren’t met by Wayland, just keep using X! We won’t be offended. I’m not trying to force you to use it. Why you heff to be mad?&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Wayland misconceptions debunked</og:title>
<og:description>This article has been on my backburner for a while, but it seems Wayland FUD is making the news again recently, so I’ve bumped up the priority a bit. For those new to my blog, I am the maintainer of wlroots, a library which implements much of the functionality required of a Wayland compositor and is arguably the single most influential project in Wayland right now; and sway, a popular Wayland compositor which is nearing version 1.0. Let’s go over some of the common misconceptions I hear about Wayland and why they’re wrong. Feel free to pick and choose the misconceptions you believe to read and disregard the rest.</og:description>

<title>An ex-YouTube whistleblower on their recommendation engine</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;thread-head&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pic-user d-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://threader.app/@gchaslot&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;post-img-user&quot; class=&quot;users-thread&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1058783335021928448/n9gEX9FB.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot; id=&quot;thread-post-start&quot;&gt;YouTube announced they will stop recommending some conspiracy theories such as flat earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on the AI that promoted them by the *billions*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is why it’s a historic victory. Thread. 1/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2MMXNGn&quot; title=&quot;https://bit.ly/2MMXNGn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2MMXNGn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Brian is my best friend’s in-law. After his dad died in a motorcycle accident, he became depressed. He fell down the rabbit hole of YouTube conspiracy theories, with flat earth, aliens &amp;amp; co. Now he does not trust anyone. He stopped working, seeing friends, and wanting kids. 2/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Brian spends most of his time watching YouTube, supported by his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his parents, family and friends, his story is heartbreaking.&lt;br/&gt;But from the point of view of YouTube’s AI, he’s a jackpot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;We designed YT’s AI to increase the time people spend online, because it leads to more ads. The AI considers Brian as a model that *should be reproduced*. It takes note of every single video he watches &amp;amp; uses that signal to recommend it to more people 4/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2012/08/youtube-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time.html&quot; title=&quot;https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2012/08/youtube-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2012/08/youtub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;How many people like Brian are allured down such rabbit holes everyday day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By design, the AI will try to get as many as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Brian's hyper-engagement slowly biases YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/ People who spend their lives on YT affect recommendations more&lt;br/&gt;2/ So the content they watch gets more views&lt;br/&gt;3/ Then youtubers notice and create more of it&lt;br/&gt;4/ And people spend even more time on that content. And back at 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;This vicious circle was also observed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tay.ai&quot; title=&quot;http://tay.ai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;tay.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it explains why the bot became racist in less than 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Platforms that use AIs often get biased by tiny groups of hyper-active users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot; title=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://www.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;theverge.com/2016/3/24/1129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;7050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Example of YT vicious circle: two years ago I found out that many conspiracies were promoted by the AI much more than truth, for instance flat earth videos were promoted ~10x more than round earth ones 🌎🤯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@guillaumechaslot/how-youtubes-a-i-boosts-alternative-facts-3cc276f47cf7&quot; title=&quot;https://medium.com/@guillaumechaslot/how-youtubes-a-i-boosts-alternative-facts-3cc276f47cf7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;medium.com/@guillaumechas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lot/how-youtubes-a-i-boosts-alternative-facts-3cc276f47cf7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;I was not the only one to notice AI harms. @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tristanharris&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;tristanharris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tristanharris&lt;/a&gt; talked about addiction. @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeynep&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;zeynep&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;zeynep&lt;/a&gt; talked about radicalization. @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noUpside&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;noUpside&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;noUpside&lt;/a&gt;, political abuse and conspiracies. @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamesbridle&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;jamesbridle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jamesbridle&lt;/a&gt;, disgusting kids videos. @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/google&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;google&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;'s @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;fchollet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fchollet&lt;/a&gt;, the danger of AI propaganda:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@francois.chollet/what-worries-me-about-ai-ed9df072b704&quot; title=&quot;https://medium.com/@francois.chollet/what-worries-me-about-ai-ed9df072b704&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;medium.com/@francois.chol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let/what-worries-me-about-ai-ed9df072b704&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Since then many newspapers spoke about AI harms, as for instance: @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wsj&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;wsj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wsj&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guardian&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;guardian&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;nytimes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nytimes&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;BuzzFeed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/washingtonpost&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;washingtonpost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;washingtonpost&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bloomberg&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;bloomberg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/huffpost&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;huffpost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;huffpost&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dailybeast&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;dailybeast&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dailybeast&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vox&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;vox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vox&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NBCNews&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;NBCNews&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NBCNews&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VICE&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;VICE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VICE&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cjr&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;cjr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cjr&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/techreview&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;techreview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;techreview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalism matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;There are 2 ways to fix vicious circles like with &quot;flat earth&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) make people spend more time on round earth videos&lt;br/&gt;2) change the AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube’s economic incentive is for solution 1).&lt;br/&gt;After 13 years, YouTube made the historic choice to go towards 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will this fix work? 11/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;The AI change will have a huge impact because affected channels have billions of views, overwhelmingly coming from recommendations. For instance the channel secureteam10 made *half a billion* views with deceiving claims promoted by the AI, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2Bgkii5&quot; title=&quot;https://bit.ly/2Bgkii5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2Bgkii5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 12/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23secureteam10&quot; title=&quot;#secureteam10&quot; class=&quot;tweet-url hashtag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#secureteam10&lt;/a&gt; was the most liked channel of Buckey Wolfe, who came to believe his brother was a “lizard” and killed him with a sword.&lt;br/&gt;To understand how he fell down the rabbit hole, see his 1312 public likes here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Buckeywolfe/videos?shelf_id=0&amp;amp;sort=dd&amp;amp;view=15&quot; title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Buckeywolfe/videos?shelf_id=0&amp;amp;sort=dd&amp;amp;view=15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://www.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;youtube.com/user/Buckeywol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fe/videos?shelf_id=0&amp;amp;sort=dd&amp;amp;view=15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/seattle-man-who-stabbed-his-brother-to-death-with-4-foot-sword-thought-he-was-a-lizard-police-say&quot; title=&quot;https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/seattle-man-who-stabbed-his-brother-to-death-with-4-foot-sword-thought-he-was-a-lizard-police-say&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://www.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;clickondetroit.com/news/national/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;seattle-man-who-stabbed-his-brother-to-death-with-4-foot-sword-thought-he-was-a-lizard-police-say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;This AI change will save thousands from falling into such rabbit holes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If it decreases between 1B and 10B views on such content, and if we assume one person falling for it each 100,000 views, it will prevent 10,000 to 100,000 &quot;falls&quot;) 14/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;A concern remains that other rabbit holes are arising. I created &lt;a href=&quot;http://algotransparency.org&quot; title=&quot;http://algotransparency.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;algotransparency.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify and monitor harmful content recommended by the AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Conclusion: YouTube's announcement is a great victory which will save thousands. It's only the beginning of a more humane technology. Technology that empowers all of us, instead of deceiving the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see something, say something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16/&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PKI for busy people</title>
<link>https://rehn.me/posts/pki-for-busy-people.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rehn.me/posts/pki-for-busy-people.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;PKI for busy people&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;117.94413996627&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-key infrastructure (PKI) is an umbrella term for everything that has to do with certificate and key management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a quick overview of the important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public-key cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-key cryptography involves a key pair: a &lt;em&gt;public key&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;private key&lt;/em&gt;. Each entity has their own. The public key can be shared around, the private key is secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They allow doing two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encrypt&lt;/em&gt; a message with the public key, &lt;em&gt;decrypt&lt;/em&gt; it with the private key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign&lt;/em&gt; a message with the private key, &lt;em&gt;verify&lt;/em&gt; it with the public key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common algorithms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)&quot;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt; (used for both) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm&quot;&gt;ECDSA&lt;/a&gt; (only for signatures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, public-key cryptography can be slow. That’s why nearly all protocols (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt;) only use it for authentication. Much faster symmetric-key algorithms (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&quot;&gt;AES&lt;/a&gt;) are then used for encryption. This requires a shared secret, which is usually agreed upon using some flavor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange&quot;&gt;Diffie-Hellman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hashing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashing algorithms (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms&quot;&gt;SHA&lt;/a&gt;) are one-way functions that take any input and compute a fixed-size output. The output is called a &lt;em&gt;hash&lt;/em&gt; (or sometimes &lt;em&gt;digest&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signatures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signatures authenticate messages. Roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To sign a message, encrypt it with the private key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To verify a signature, decrypt it with the public key and make sure it matches the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signing the whole message is pretty inefficient, so usually its hash is signed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certificate is a name and public key bound by a signature. It identifies the owner of a public key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signee is called a certificate authority (CA). The CA is often some big company, like VeriSign. With internal PKI, it can be any entity that nodes have been configured to trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CA’s certificate can be signed by another CA, and so on. The last certificate in the chain is called a &lt;em&gt;root certificate&lt;/em&gt;. Root certificates are trusted and stored locally. They’re usually shipped along the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Formats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often when people talk about certificates, they refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509&quot;&gt;X.509&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a flexible format for representing certificates. X.509 is used by TLS, which is used by a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things, like HTTPS and Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X.509 certificates are written in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One&quot;&gt;ASN.1&lt;/a&gt; notation. The ASN.1 is usually serialized into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding&quot;&gt;DER&lt;/a&gt;. Since binary data can be a pain to transmit, it’s often further encoded into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail&quot;&gt;PEM&lt;/a&gt;. PEM is essentially just &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64&quot;&gt;Base64&lt;/a&gt;-encoded DER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificate verification consists of making sure the certificate chain is valid and leads to a trusted root certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It of course assumes we trust the CAs, safe in the knowledge that they conform to sane security practices and only issue certificates to verified entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bundling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since verification requires the complete chain, certificates are often distributed as a bundle. In the case of TLS, the chain is sent during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.4.2&quot;&gt;handshake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually PEM files are just con&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;enated into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates can also be bundled using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12&quot;&gt;PKCS #12&lt;/a&gt; (also known as PFX) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315&quot;&gt;PKCS #7&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference is PKCS #12 can store private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Issuance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When applying for a certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The client sends a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request&quot;&gt;certificate signing request&lt;/a&gt; (CSR) to the CA. It includes the client’s public key and a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3739#section-3.1.2&quot;&gt;distinguished name attributes&lt;/a&gt; (such as country and domain name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everything looks good, the CA generates a certificate from the CSR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest case, the CA just performs Domain Validation (DV). It’s usually fast and automated, like checking for some specific DNS record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more thorough vetting, there’s also Organization Validation (OV) and Extended Validation (EV). OV implies DV &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; verifying ownership of the legal entity. EV is the slowest and most rigorous of all, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/&quot;&gt;CA/Browser Forum guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. EV certificates are usually displayed prominently (for example, on Safari the URL will be green).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For internal PKI, you can do whatever works best. With Kubernetes, you might send certificates to the nodes manually, or automate client CSRs and signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Revocation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s basically two ways to revoke certificates: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list&quot;&gt;certificate revocation lists&lt;/a&gt; (CRLs) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol&quot;&gt;OCSP&lt;/a&gt;. A CRL is just a big list of certificates revoked by the CA. OCSP is a protocol that allows inquiring about a specific certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have their flaws. They add overhead. A lot of software don’t care. It might be easier to just use short-lived certificates and make issuance super smooth and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With someone’s public key, we can verify their signatures and send them encrypted messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With our private key, we can sign messages and decrypt messages sent to us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificates identify public key owners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We trust a certificate because we trust the CA that signed it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We trust the CA because Apple/Google/Microsoft/whoever added the CA’s certificate on the server/etc. trusts them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;February 11, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Case for Transmissible Alzheimer&amp;#039;s Grows</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsettling evidence that Alzheimer’s Disease may be transmissible under limited -- but definitely nonzero -- circumstances keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last December &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/prions-nearly-indestructible-and-universally-lethal-seed-the-eyes-of-victims/&quot;&gt;I wrote about research&lt;/a&gt; that revealed that infectious, lethal proteins called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion&quot;&gt;prions&lt;/a&gt; have the potential to be transmitted on optical medical equipment because they are present throughout the eyes of victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all the more disturbing in light of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/prions-are-forever/&quot;&gt;a study I had also recently written about&lt;/a&gt; that suggested that peptide aggregates – essentially sticky, self-propagating clumps of misfolded protein bits collectively referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid&quot;&gt;amyloid&lt;/a&gt; -- found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients may be transmissible in the same ways that prions are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just a few days after I wrote about the prion eye hazard, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0790-y#ref-CR1&quot;&gt;a new paper appeared in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that seemed to take the evidence for the transmissibility of Alzheimer’s peptides from “circumstantial” to “experimentally produced”. It is fascinating, if unsettling, news, that further blurs the line between amyloid and prions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human prion diseases are rare. Prions usually form spontaneously or are inherited via faulty genes, but sometimes find their way into humans through consumption of contaminated brain or spinal cord tissue. In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy&quot;&gt;Mad Cow Disease&lt;/a&gt;, it happened via contaminated beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare cases (so far as we know), human prion transmission has happened when surgical instruments used on an infected patient were cleaned and reused on an uninfected one. Prions stick to steel like glue, are stable for decades at room temperature, and survive a bombardment of chemical and physical cleaning assaults that are more than sufficient to obliterate other pathogens. Prions are survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15369&quot;&gt;In the original Alzheimer’s transmissibility study&lt;/a&gt;, scientists examined the brains of eight patients treated with prion-contaminated human growth hormone as children who decades later died from prion disease (out of over 30,000 people so treated, more than 200 died this way).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hormone had become contaminated with prions because it had been extracted from cadavers -- one or a few of whom presumably died of prion disease -- and processed in such a way that the prions remained. Of course, prions are not the only misfolded proteins that potentially lurk in the brains of cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered the brains of seven of the eight contained, in addition to prions, peptide aggregates called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta&quot;&gt;Amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; (Aβ for short). Aβ is a collection of misfolded peptides whose correctly folded versions are present in the human brain and perform a variety of mid-level tasks. When the misfolded versions form, they behave like prions, catalyzing the conversion of healthy forms into diseased ones and accumulating in clumps called plaques. Indeed, past experiments have shown that injecting small amounts of human Aβ into the brains of primates or of mice bred to express a humanized form of the Aβ precursor protein generates Aβ plaques in these animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaques are characteristic of and possibly the instigators of Alzheimer’s Disease when they accumulate around neurons in the brain. However, the seven brains did not have plaques. The Aβ in these brains had built up in the walls of blood vessels, where such accumulations can cause bleeding and dementia. This condition is called cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and it co-occurs with most Alzheimer’s Disease but can also strike on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight victims had all still been young enough that their brains would not be expected to show any signs of Alzheimer’s or cerebral amyloid angiopathy unless they had genetic risk factors. Understandably, given the implications, the scientists who studied their brains were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The December &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study was authored by this same team. In it, they revealed that they had managed get their hands on original vials of prion-contaminated growth hormone that had been helpfully squirreled away for decades by Public Health England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tested the samples for both Aβ peptides and tau, another protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and causes its other brain pathology: tangles. Indeed, two types of Aβ and tau were still present in the vials, even after more than &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;decades of room temperature storage&lt;/em&gt;. Aβ and tau, at least, are survivors too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This team took their study a step further by injecting a tiny sample of these vintage vials into the brains of mice engineered to be susceptible to human Alzheimer’s. The mice developed both Aβ plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although they showed no signs of tau. Aβ peptides had not only managed to survive decades of room-temeprature storage, they were also still transmissible. This is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important – imperative – to emphasize that transmissible does not equal contagious. There is absolutely no evidence that people with dementia can spread their disease casually to people around them. Even donated blood appears to be safe, as no association with blood transfusions and Alzheimer’s Disease has ever been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, in the course of some neurological surgeries – and perhaps certain kinds of medical exams – prions may become lodged on equipment. And there is a chance this equipment could transmit the disease. Organ donation protocols may also warrant some review. It was already known that donations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater&quot;&gt;dura mater&lt;/a&gt;, a tough brain covering, have transmitted Aβ to young people in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wonder. Since Alzheimer’s Disease is so common, and we have not (to my knowledge) been looking for Alzheimer's caused by surgical or other medical procedures that access eye or neural tissue -- particularly in patients for whom the appearance of Alzheimer’s would not be surprising -- is it possible that we are underestimating the transmission potential of this disease, and that such events are less rare than we would guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is not the only neurodegenerative disease in which aggregating misfolded host proteins – a class referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid&quot;&gt;amyloid&lt;/a&gt; -- seem to propagate and wreak havoc either. In Parkinson’s Disease, misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins spread through the brain, and in Amylotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), the misfolded, accumulating protein is TDP-43. We should investigate the transmission potential of these diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that seemed to separate these conditions from classic prion diseases was transmissibility. But now that that barrier has been breached for at least one, I also wonder: What is the difference between amyloid and prions? Are they part of a spectrum? Are they one in the same? If not, what is the difference? Can what we’ve learned about the biology of prions help our efforts to fight amyloid dementias? Of course, since we still can’t cure prion diseases, it may not be much help even if so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization that the peptides involved in some of the most common and feared dementias on Earth may be transmissible under even limited conditions is a sobering and humbling reminder of how very little we still understand about them. Given what we know about prions, I think we would be wise not to underestimate their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>A 26,000-Year Astronomical Monument Hidden in Plain Sight</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.longnow.org/02019/01/29/the-26000-year-astronomical-monument-hidden-in-plain-sight/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20898&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20898 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_0JGT-kNT25ClbFTI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_0JGT-kNT25ClbFTI.jpg 768w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_0JGT-kNT25ClbFTI-225x300.jpg 225w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;One of the two massive bronze cast sculptures that flank Hoover Dam’s Monument Plaza. (Photo by Alexander Rose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the western flank of the Hoover Dam stands a little-understood monument, commissioned by the US Bureau of Reclamation when construction of the dam began in 01931. The most noticeable parts of this corner of the dam, now known as Monument Plaza, are the massive winged bronze sculptures and central flagpole which are often photographed by visitors. The most amazing feature of this plaza, however, is under their feet as they take those pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20902&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20902 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_bx7V-9aallbq_Yw3-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;524&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_bx7V-9aallbq_Yw3-1.jpg 1000w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_bx7V-9aallbq_Yw3-1-300x157.jpg 300w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_bx7V-9aallbq_Yw3-1-768x402.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Marking in the terrazzo floor of Monument Plaza showing the location of Vega, which will be our North Star in roughly 12,000 years. (Photo by Alexander Rose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in this monument because this axial precession is also the slowest cycle that we track in Long Now’s 10,000 Year Clock. Strangely, little to no documentation of this installation seemed to be available, except for a few vacation pictures on Flickr. So the last time I was in Las Vegas, I made a special trip out to Hoover Dam to see if I could learn more about this obscure 26,000-year monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20904&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20904 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_WZGHHLqEWgpy6I7A.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;387&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_WZGHHLqEWgpy6I7A.jpg 600w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_WZGHHLqEWgpy6I7A-300x194.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Monument Plaza with access road on left. (Image courtesy of US Bureau of Reclamation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I parked my rental car on the Nevada side of the dam on a day pushing 100 degrees. I quickly found Monument Plaza just opposite the visitor center where tours of the dam are offered. While the plaza is easy to find, it stands apart from all the main tours and stories about the dam. With the exception of the writing in the plaza floor itself, the only information I could find came from a speaker running on loop, broadcasting a basic description of the monument while visitors walked around the area. When I asked my tour guide about it, he suggested that there may be some historical documentation and directed me to Emme Woodward, the dam’s historian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20905&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20905&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_8CDBMHTvTvf_lG3r.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;616&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_8CDBMHTvTvf_lG3r.jpg 600w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_8CDBMHTvTvf_lG3r-300x240.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Hansen laying out the axial precession.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to get in touch with her after returning home. As she sent me a few items, I began to see why the Bureau of Reclamation doesn’t explain very much about the monument’s background. The first thing she sent me was a description of the plaza by Oskar J. W. Hansen, the artist himself, which I thought would tell me everything I wanted to know. While parts of it were helpful, the artist’s statement of intention was also highly convoluted and opaque. An excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These [human] postures may be matched to their corresponding reflexes in terms of angle and degree much as one would join cams in a worm-gear drive. There is an angle for doubt, for sorrow, for hate, for joy, for contemplation, and for devotion. There are as many others as there are fleeting emotions within the brain of each individual who inhabits the Earth. Who knows not all these postures of the mind if he would but stop to think of them as usable factors for determining proclivities of character? It is a knowledge bred down to us through the past experience of the whole race of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pretty hard to imagine the US Bureau of Reclamation using this type of write-up to interpret the monument… and they don’t. And so there it stands, a 26,000-year clock of sorts, for all the world to see, and yet still mired in obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20908&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20908 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_Db-LhI9UfyMj06-k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;742&quot; height=&quot;594&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_Db-LhI9UfyMj06-k.jpg 742w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_Db-LhI9UfyMj06-k-300x240.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Markings on the floor showing that Thuban was the North Star for the ancient Egyptians at the time of the Great Pyramids. (Photo by Alexander Rose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I may never totally understand the inner motivations of the monument’s designer, I did want to understand it on a technical level. How did Hansen create a celestial clock face frozen in time that we can interpret and understand as the date of the dam’s completion? The earth’s axial precession is a rather obscure piece of astronomy, and our understanding of it through history has been spotty at best. That this major engineering feat was celebrated through this monument to the axial precession still held great interest to me, and I wanted to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20911&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20911 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_ilRFnuvLvCnE3rtW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_ilRFnuvLvCnE3rtW.jpg 600w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_ilRFnuvLvCnE3rtW-240x300.jpg 240w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The giant bronze statues being craned into place. (Image courtesy of US Bureau of Reclamation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed for more documentation, and the historian sent me instructions for using the Bureau of Reclamation’s image archive site as well as some keywords to search for. The black and white images you see here come from this resource. Using the convoluted web site was a challenge, and at first I had difficulty finding any photos of the plaza before or during its construction. As I discovered, the problem was that I was searching with the term “Monument Plaza,” a name only given to it after its completion in 01936. In order to find images during its construction, I had to search for “Safety Island,” so named because at the time of the dam’s construction, it was an island in the road where workers could stand behind a berm to protect themselves from the never-ending onslaught of cement trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20913&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20913 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_S0HQ0jdt3B-OqD6E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_S0HQ0jdt3B-OqD6E.jpg 800w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_S0HQ0jdt3B-OqD6E-300x240.jpg 300w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_S0HQ0jdt3B-OqD6E-768x614.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Hansen next to the completed axial precession layout before the terrazzo was laid in. (Image courtesy of US Bureau of Reclamation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now had some historical text and photos, but I was still missing a complete diagram of the plaza that would allow me to really understand it. I contacted the historian again, and she obtained permission from her superiors to release the actual building plans. I suspect that they generally don’t like to release technical plans of the dam for security reasons, but it seems they deemed my request a low security risk as the monument is not part of the structure of the dam. The historian sent me a tube full of large blueprints and a CD of the same prints already scanned. With this in hand I was finally able to re-construct the technical intent of the plaza and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how the plaza marks the date of the dam’s construction in the nearly 26,000-year cycle of the earth’s precession, it is worth explaining what exactly axial precession is. In the simplest terms, it is the earth “wobbling” on its tilted axis like a gyroscope — but very, very slowly. This wobbling effectively moves what we see as the center point that stars appear to revolve around each evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20915&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20915 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_SBI6X3pwJu2x-clg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_SBI6X3pwJu2x-clg.jpg 800w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_SBI6X3pwJu2x-clg-300x200.jpg 300w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_SBI6X3pwJu2x-clg-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Long exposure of star trails depicting how all the stars appear to revolve around the earth’s celestial axis, which is currently pointed close to our current North Star — Polaris. Note that when I say that the stars of the night sky “appear to” rotate around Polaris, it is because this apparent rotation is only due to our vantage point on a rotating planet. (Image courtesy of NASA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, this center point lies very close to the conveniently bright star Polaris. The reason we have historically paid so much attention to this celestial center, or North Star, is because it is the star that stays put all through the course of the night. Having this one fixed point in the sky is the foundation of all celestial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20917&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20917 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_rE4_4A9lv6zHo5ZN.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;399&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 1. The earth sits at roughly a 23 degree tilt. Axial precession is that tilt slowly wobbling around in a circle, changing what we perceive as the celestial pole or “North Star.” (Image from Wikipedia entry on Axial Precession.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that point near Polaris, which we call the North Star, is actually slowly moving and tracing a circle through the night sky. While Polaris is our North Star, Hansen’s terrazzo floor points out that the North Star of the ancient Egyptians, as they built the great pyramids, was Thuban. And in about 12,000 years, our North Star will be Vega. The workings of this precession are best explained with an animation, as in figure 1. Here you can see how the axis of the earth traces a circle in the sky over the course of 25,772 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to see how this all works in the inlaid floor at Monument Plaza. The view that you really want to have of the plaza is directly from above. You would need a crane to get this view of the real thing, but by using the original technical drawing as an underlay I was able to mark up a diagram which hopefully clarifies it (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20918&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20918 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_70-D060B65OPXY-V.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;715&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_70-D060B65OPXY-V.jpg 800w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_70-D060B65OPXY-V-300x268.jpg 300w, http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_70-D060B65OPXY-V-768x686.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 2. Description overlaid on the original technical drawing for the layout of terrazzo floor. (Underlay courtesy of US Bureau of Reclamation, color notations by Alexander Rose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this diagram, you can see that the center of the circle traced by the axial precession is actually the massive flag pole in the center of the plaza. This axial circle is prominently marked around the pole, and the angle of Polaris was depicted as precisely as possible to show where it would have been on the date of the dam’s opening. Hansen used the rest of the plaza floor to show the location of the planets visible that evening, and many of the bright stars that appear in the night sky at that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining planet locations with the angle of precession, we are able to pinpoint the time of the dam’s completion down to within a day. We are now designing a similar system — though with moving parts — in the dials of the 10,000 Year Clock. It is likely that at least major portions of the Hoover Dam will still be in place hundreds of thousands of years from now. Hopefully the Clock will still be ticking and Hansen’s terrazzo floor will still be there, even if it continues to baffle visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_20919&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-20919 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_QpK0dPz4sOtgKfQYShhF1A.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A high resolution drawing of the terrazzo layout. (Courtesy of US Bureau of Reclamation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Emme Woodward of the US Bureau of Reclamation for all her help in finding the original images and plans of Monument Plaza. If you have further interest in reading Hansen’s original writings about the plaza or in seeing the plans, I have uploaded all the scans to the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Proposed Jail Time for Tech Companies Who Steal Data</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://trofire.com/2019/02/08/democrat-proposes-jail-time-for-tech-companies-who-steal-your-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senator &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;Ron Wyden has put together a new bill (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2019/02/wyden-pitches-jail-time-billions-in-fines-for-online-privacy-violators-with-do-not-track-bill.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ron Wyden has put together a new bill&lt;/a&gt; that would actually lead to some of the biggest tech leaders in the United States facing serious legal consequences, including jail time, if their companies steal and sell user data, or allow a massive data breach to occur at their company. This is a phenomenal piece of legislation that is sorely needed in America today, and Ring of Fire’s &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;Farron Cousins (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/farronbalanced&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Farron Cousins&lt;/a&gt; explains why this bill is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhB7_4sxff8?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This transcript was generated by a third-party transcription software company, so please excuse any typos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the sad reality about being online, if you have used Facebook, if you have tried to get a credit score or if you’ve had a yahoo email account anytime within the last three years for any of those things, then the chances that your data has either been leaked out to unsavory characters or just straight up sold by those corporations, the chances of that are roughly 99 percent. If you are a US citizen and you’ve done any of those three, uh, three things within the last three years, that’s pretty remarkable, right? We’re almost at almost 100 percent of us have either had our data leaked or stolen. If we’re in one of those online communities, some of us, depending on how many of those years have had our data stolen and leaked multiple different times by multiple different companies. And here’s the real kicker. Nobody’s gone to jail, no CEO, no executive running these companies that routinely lose our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them have ever faced any kind of actual consequence for this except maybe a few class action lawsuits. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden for months now has been trying to change that. And He seems to be fighting an uphill battle all by himself to get some kind of accountability for these massive tech companies that continuously take our data. Ron Wyden back in the fall, introduced legislation that would set a new standard. It would create new rules that these tech companies would have to follow with regards to our privacy and our data, and if they lied about it or didn’t do everything properly, they could face massive fines of up to four percent of their annual revenue, which would result in billions upon billions of dollars for some of these companies and possibly even jail time, jail sentences, prison for the CEOs and executives of these companies who knowingly leak our data or sell our data and then lie to us about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would go to jail under Ron Wyden’s new bill that he is still pushing to this day. And again, this is a piece of legislation that desperately needs to be enacted. This is something that has to happen here in the United States. The tech companies, whether knowingly or unwittingly are giving away our data and the worst part of those who know that they’re doing it right, it’s one thing to just be bad at your job and you leak a bunch of data and oops, you didn’t notice that a hacker was in your system like a Kofax for months. Stealing people’s data and social security numbers and addresses and drivers license numbers. Oops, we didn’t notice, but it’s another to be a company like Facebook that takes your private messages and sells that data. It takes your address, it takes your interest, it takes your browsing history and sells that to people without your permission Wydens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill would change that. You could opt in to a do not share list and companies would no longer be able to sell your data. You might have to pay a small fee to be put on that list, but it would then protect your data. And if the company has lied about it in their annual reports to Congress, that would be mandatory at this point. Or reports to regulator, excuse me. Um, if they lied about it, they would go to jail and they would lose a lot of their profits. Isn’t that the way this should work? If a company lies about what they’re doing to you, if they’re putting your personal data up there on the auction block without your knowledge, and then they not only lie to you about it, but lie to regulators about it. Shouldn’t that person be in jail? Shouldn’t that person be made to be an example of what not to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what’s missing in this country right now. It’s been missing for decades. The example of what not to do, white collar criminals are rampant on Wall Street in the tech industry, in the oil industry, the fossil fuel industry, the chemical industry. We have seen nothing but criminal behavior from a lot of these CEOs and shareholders and executives, pharmaceutical companies too. They’re about the worst of the worst and the reason they continue engaging in this kind of criminal behavior, putting out a medication that they know is going to kill people, but also make them lots of money, dumping their toxins into a waterway, knowing they’re going to poison 40,000 people, but they don’t want to spend the money to properly get rid of it. None of those CEOs or executives who made those decisions ever went to prison, and what that does is it sends a message to everybody else that it’ll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can afford the fine. You don’t have to worry about jail time and everybody’s going to be okay. It except of course all those people you gave cancer too who are dying slow, horrible, painful deaths. They’re not okay, but that’s not used. So what does it matter? Wydens. Bill seeks to change that. At least for the tech industry. There is no reason why any person on Capitol Hill should vote against this. This is about our privacy. This is about our data. This is about our livelihoods and if you’re one of those people who have had your data stolen and then had the deal with the fallout of that, the phone calls to credit card companies, getting them to cancel, change your numbers, you know, try and get your money back from a bank after your debit card number was stolen. I’ve been through that. It is hell. And anyone who’s gone through any of that understands the same thing. The companies that allowed this to happen, they need to see their CEO’s pushed out of their pit houses, pushed out of their mansions, pushed out of the board rooms and shoved in the back of a police car. Not to be seen again for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

Our start-up idea
&lt;p name=&quot;df91&quot; id=&quot;df91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;18 months ago, my wife and I came up with idea for an app. We carried out extensive research to find a company who could help us to create our vision. We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://upwork.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://upwork.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt; and found a company who had extensive experience in the area of development we required. Their reviews were great and the developers we spoke to were eager to create our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6108&quot; id=&quot;6108&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To cut a long story short — after many months of collaborative work between ourselves and our app developers and many mistakes along the way, we were ready to launch our app. Behind the scenes we had also been busy creating our brand, social media pages, promotional videos, adverts and getting ready to onboard businesses and customers. We’d invested every penny of our entire £25,000 into the development of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;43f3&quot; id=&quot;43f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After a few late disasters with our dedicated server and validation process within the app, we were finally ready to launch in January 2019. Then, to our dismay we realised our app had been removed from the Play Store. Our first thought was that there was another problem with our server connecting to the app. We then had a look on the App Store and saw that the iOS version of our app was listed with no problems whatsoever. We were confused as to why the app was listed on the App Store and not the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b5c5&quot; id=&quot;b5c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I then attempted to login to my ‘Google Developer Account’ for the first time. Previous to this our app developers were the only ones to access our account to upload and update our app for us. Each time I tried to login to my account I was sent to a blank page with ‘403’ error message. I couldn’t understand what had gone wrong. I contacted the app developers who attempted to login and they also received the same error message. I then contacted the Play Console Help team via their online &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7218994?hl=en&quot; data-href=&quot;https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7218994?hl=en&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a8b2&quot; id=&quot;a8b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to Google’s records, my account had been terminated and I had been informed of this via email on 23rd January 2019. I was confused as I had not received an email but I was still confident the situation would be resolved quickly. I checked my junk folder and found I had been sent an email to let me know my account had been terminated. The email had a link for me to be able to appeal the decision and within 4 hours of completing the form I received the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*4Icjidtodl9Syi3o60B9xA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;589&quot; data-height=&quot;248&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4Icjidtodl9Syi3o60B9xA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Google’s automatic rejection of appeal to reinstate Google Play Developer Account
&lt;p name=&quot;1fc1&quot; id=&quot;1fc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I couldn’t believe what I was reading — effectively my accounted had been terminated because of an ‘associated’ account. I had created a Google Developer Account simply so I could pass on the login details to my app developers who uploaded and updated the app via my account each time. Therefore, the developers, one of their employees or one of their ‘associated’ accounts had previously been banned and therefore by mere ‘association’ my developer account had also been terminated, causing our app to be removed from the Play Store and effectively ruining our whole start-up business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aafa&quot; id=&quot;aafa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I sent an email back to Google Support explaining there must have been a mistake unless my account was fraudulently used without my knowledge. I asked for a contact that I could speak to so that we could resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b96&quot; id=&quot;1b96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My request for a contact was completely ignored and on 30th January 2019 I received the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cnbUXwNb-7_2ncMYQkwmCw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;630&quot; data-height=&quot;224&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cnbUXwNb-7_2ncMYQkwmCw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Google’s response to requesting human support
&lt;p name=&quot;c814&quot; id=&quot;c814&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It was at this stage that I became very concerned. Our app and therefore our whole business was useless without cross-platform functionality and there appeared to be no way of contacting Google to get the issue resolved. I contacted &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; title=&quot;Twitter profile for @GooglePlayDev&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@GooglePlayDev&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter and received the following response when requesting contact details of somebody that could look into our case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*_52GzeZev-nOOCoemQh0mA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;317&quot; data-height=&quot;393&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_52GzeZev-nOOCoemQh0mA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Google’s Twitter Developer Support
&lt;p name=&quot;2bc8&quot; id=&quot;2bc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I then searched on forums for help and there were countless developers who had posted about similar situations they had been in and none of them were able to get their situation resolved. I quickly started to lose all hope when I came across an open letter from an app developer who had managed to get his rejected appeal overturned and his developer account and apps reinstated: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://android.jlelse.eu/google-just-terminated-our-start-up-google-play-publisher-account-onchristmas-day-5cb69a454da0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://android.jlelse.eu/google-just-terminated-our-start-up-google-play-publisher-account-onchristmas-day-5cb69a454da0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://android.jlelse.eu/google-just-terminated-our-start-up-google-play-publisher-account-onchristmas-day-5cb69a454da0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e06d&quot; id=&quot;e06d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The developer had managed to get his story to go viral and attract the attention of some of the ‘developer relationship managers’ within Google’s Play team. Therefore, my only option left was to get in contact with these employees to see if they would look into our case. I connected with as many ‘developer relationship managers’ as possible including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianapuchianu/?originalSubdomain=uk&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianapuchianu/?originalSubdomain=uk&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adriana Puchianu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-ben-har-8b665a62/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-ben-har-8b665a62/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aleksandra Ben Har&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/thierryamuller/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/thierryamuller/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thierry Muller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmasterson/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmasterson/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Masterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulkinlan/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulkinlan/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Kinlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kubrazengin/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kubrazengin/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubra Zengin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimegonzalezgarcia/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimegonzalezgarcia/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jaime Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbortolotti/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbortolotti/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicolas Bortolotti&lt;/a&gt;. I also attempted to message &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/purnima-kochikar-a66b062b/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/purnima-kochikar-a66b062b/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Purnima Kochikar&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of Google Play, Apps &amp;amp; Games at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8271&quot; id=&quot;8271&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As of 6th February 2019, I have received no further responses to my emails to Google Play Developer Support or twitter messages to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; title=&quot;Twitter profile for @GooglePlayDev&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@GooglePlayDev&lt;/a&gt; Only one of the developer relationship managers on LinkedIn has been good enough to message me back but even he has no ability to overwrite the automatic termination process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c278&quot; id=&quot;c278&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I am in utter shock at the lack of customer support from Google. Both Apple and Amazon have app developer customer service departments that deal specifically with issues like this. I have no idea how Google can terminate accounts without fully checking the reasons behind the termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b605&quot; id=&quot;b605&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To put into perspective the situation we are in, imagine one of your neighbours commits a crime and is arrested by the police. You don’t know which neighbour has committed the crime but you are linked to each other by the street you live on and therefore you are ‘associated’ to that neighbour. As a result, you are also arrested for the crime and you are guilty by default! There is no unbiased court case or appeals procedure because the decision is final and you cannot find anybody to contact to get your case re-heard! That is exactly how we feel! Our account has been terminated because of an &lt;br/&gt;‘association’ that we don’t know and our whole business is ruined as a result. Even more worrying is that anyone who this ‘associate’ develops apps for in the future will also have their apps removed and accounts terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;de5f&quot; id=&quot;de5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The fact that our app is still listed on the App Store (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hoopapployalty/id1287914039?mt=8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hoopapployalty/id1287914039?mt=8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hoopapployalty/id1287914039?mt=8&lt;/a&gt;) with no issues whatsoever demonstrates that we have done nothing wrong and that our account and app should be reinstated to the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16b5&quot; id=&quot;16b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our absolute last hope is for the good people reading this letter to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;like, share and comment&lt;/strong&gt; on this story in the hope that the Google team will do the right thing and reinstate our app and developer account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e624&quot; id=&quot;e624&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Thank you in advance for your support&lt;/p&gt;
