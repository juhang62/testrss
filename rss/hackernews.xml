&lt;p&gt;A 34-year-old citizen of Pakistan is charged with paying more than $1 million in bribes to employees at AT&amp;amp;T’s Seattle-area offices and call centers to install malware on the company’s network to unlock millions of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-conspiracy-illegally-unlock-cell-phones-profit-extradited-hong-kong&quot;&gt;indictment unsealed today&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Department of Justice, Muhammad Fahd and a partner who is now believed to be deceased unlocked more than 2 million smartphones from 2012 to 2017 that could be taken off the network and brought to other carriers. AT&amp;amp;T lost more than $5 million per year as a result of the alleged scheme, per the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fahd allegedly recruited AT&amp;amp;T “insiders” to install malware programs that gathered confidential information and submitted unlock requests using employee credentials via a remote server. He encouraged insiders to recruit other potential co-conspirators and allegedly paid one employee $428,500 over five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T investigators appeared to catch on to the scheme at one point as several workers left the company when confronted about their involvement in 2014. The defendants then allegedly recruited new employees to execute their plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the alleged scheme, per the indictment, was to “sell to members of the public the resulting ability fraudulently to unlock phones, so that the members of the public could stop using AT&amp;amp;T wireless services and thereby deprive AT&amp;amp;T of the stream of payments it was owned under the customers’ service contracts and installment plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment doesn’t get into how Fahd was caught. He was arrested in Hong Kong in February 2018 at the request of U.S. authorities. Fahd was extradited from Hong Kong to the U.S. last week to face 14 different charges in federal court in Seattle, including wire fraud, violating the Travel Act and intentional damage to a protected computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This defendant thought he could safely run his bribery and hacking scheme from overseas, making millions of dollars while he induced young workers to choose greed over ethical conduct,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran of the Western District of Washington. “Now he will be held accountable for the fraud and the lives he has derailed.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Guide to Recording 660FPS Video on a $6 Raspberry Pi Camera</title>
<link>http://blog.robertelder.org/recording-660-fps-on-raspberry-pi-camera/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.robertelder.org/recording-660-fps-on-raspberry-pi-camera/</guid>
<description>&lt;h5 class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2019-08-01 - By Robert Elder&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     This article will discuss the setup steps that are required for recording videos at high frame rates on cheap Raspberry Pi cameras.  Frame rates up to 660FPS on the V1 camera and up to 1007 on the V2 camera can be achieved.  Filming at these extremely high frame rates on a Raspberry Pi is much more challenging and involves more work than typical point and shoot photography.  This article was primarily written to supplement the instructions in the following video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7gUZpjF-1s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The instructions presented here were tested to work on a fresh Raspbian OS image with the following md5 hash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-0&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;md5sum ~/Downloads/2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-lite.img
921052ef30538b995933078e8779c585  ~/Downloads/2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-lite.img
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Furthermore, the version of Raspberry Pi that was tested was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/raspberry-pi/RASPBERRY-PI-3/1690-1000-ND/6152799&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 model B&lt;/a&gt;.  During the initial setup process, a Raspberry Pi V2 camera was plugged into the Raspberry Pi.  After the install was completed, the camera was switched to a V1 camera which also worked without further steps, so the install steps here should cover bother camera types.  The V1 camera that was tested uses the OV5647 image sensor, and the V2 camera tested uses the IMX219 sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     The general process for creating high-speed videos consists of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1) Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Hermann-SW/fork-raspiraw&quot;&gt;a fork&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/6by9/raspiraw&quot;&gt;'raspiraw'&lt;/a&gt; to capture headerless RAW image frames and timestamp metadata at ~660FPS directly into RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2) As a post-processing step, concatenate a RAW image header onto all captured RAW frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3) Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/6by9/dcraw&quot;&gt;a fork&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dcraw&quot;&gt;dcraw&lt;/a&gt; to turn the RAW image frames into .tiff files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4) Use ffmpeg along with the captured frame timestamp metadata to turn the image sequence into a video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;     The major limitation throughout this process is the speed at which memory can be copied and transmitted.  Only 20-40 seconds of video can be recorded at a time due the memory exhaustion of the Raspberry Pi.  Also limited is the resolution of the recording:  On the $6 camera, a maximum of 640x64 resolution can be recorded due to limitations on memory bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     First, make sure your camera is already installed and works correctly for recording normally at lower frame rates using raspivid and raspistill.  See the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.robertelder.org/commands-raspberry-pi-camera/&quot;&gt;An Overview of How to Do Everything with Raspberry Pi Cameras&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Then, install the following packages that are required by dcraw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev libjpeg8-dev liblcms2-dev # required for dcraw.
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Then, clone and build the required repositories for dcraw and raspiraw.  The github URLs below are convenient unmodified forks of the original repos which can be found in links elsewhere in this article.  The commit hashes specified below are the exact ones that this process was tested on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;cd ~/
git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/fork-raspiraw&quot;&gt;https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/fork-raspiraw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd fork-raspiraw &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout 18fac55136f98960ccd4dcfff95112134e5e45db
./buildme
cd ~/
git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/dcraw&quot;&gt;https://github.com/RobertElderSoftware/dcraw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd dcraw &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout 8d2bcbe8f9d280a5db8da30af9b6eb034f7f2859
./buildme
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     During the building of dcraw, the following warning message was observed.  It was found that this message could be safely ignored:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/ld: warning: libjpeg.so.62, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/6/../../../arm-linux-gnueabihf/libjasper.so, may conflict with libjpeg.so.8
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Now, install these dependencies of 'raspiraw':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install wiringpi
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Append the following inside the file '/boot/config.txt':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-5&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;dtparam=i2c_vc=on
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Append the following inside the file '/etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;i2c-dev
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Now reboot in order for the changes to take effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-7&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;sudo reboot now
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     The steps below will show the process for creating a simple 1 second slow-motion video with a 50x slowdown at a resolution of 640x64.  First, enable the I2C connection with the Camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/fork-raspiraw
./camera_i2c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Now, run this command to capture 1 second worth of RAW images frames into RAM at 660 FPS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-9&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;./raspiraw &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-ts&lt;/span&gt; /dev/shm/tstamps.csv &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-hd&lt;/span&gt;0 /dev/shm/hd0.32k &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;640&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;--vinc&lt;/span&gt; 1F &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;--fps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;660&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-sr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; /dev/shm/out.%06d.raw
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     This command will concatenate the single image frame we saved onto all of the individual image frames:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-10&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;ls /dev/shm/*.raw | &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt; i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; cat /dev/shm/hd0.32k &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PreProc&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PreProc&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;.all&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;     
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Now, run this command to use dcraw to convert each RAW image frame into a .tiff file that ffmpeg can work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-11&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;ls /dev/shm/*.all | &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt; i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; ~/dcraw/dcraw &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;-6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;-W&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PreProc&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Run this command to output and create a python script that will parse the frame timestamp data into a file that will help ffmpeg display frames at the correct position.  Note that this is a multi-line shell command (you need to copy and paste the entire thing at once):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;cat &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt; &amp;gt; /dev/shm/make_concat.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;# Use TS information:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;import csv&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;slowdownx = float(50)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;last_microsecond = 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;with open('/dev/shm/tstamps.csv') as csv_file:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;  csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;  line_count = 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;  for row in csv_reader:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;    current_microsecond = int(row[2])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;    if line_count &amp;gt; 0:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;      print(&quot;file '/dev/shm/out.%06d.raw.tiff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;duration %08f&quot; % (int(row[1]), slowdownx * float(current_microsecond - last_microsecond) / float(1000000)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;    line_count += 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;    last_microsecond = current_microsecond&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Run the timestamp processing script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-13&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;python /dev/shm/make_concat.py &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /dev/shm/ffmpeg_concats.txt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Now run ffmpeg to create the final output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-sample-14&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; concat &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-safe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; /dev/shm/ffmpeg_concats.txt &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-vcodec&lt;/span&gt; libx265 &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt;265-params lossless &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-crf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt;:v 1M &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-pix_fmt&lt;/span&gt; yuv420p &lt;span class=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;-vf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Constant&quot;&gt;pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; /dev/shm/output.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The final output video is now located at '/dev/shm/output.mp4'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gMy8k4nHtw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     The first video you film is most likely going to come out looking black.  This is because extremely high frame rate photography can only expose the sensor to light for a very short amount of time before the sensor needs to reset and record the next frame.  Thus, you should try pointing the sensor directly at a bright light source to get an idea of how bright your exposures need to be.  Filming at these high frame rates is not like regular point and shoot photography.  You'll need to be a lot more strategic in how you set up your scenes and record them. Things like getting the exposure and lighting conditions right are critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The commands above don't clear out the contents of '/dev/shm' after each recording, so you should take care to modify the steps above to prevent things like the 'ls *.all' command from using frames from a previous recording when the recording times are different.  Also, note that '/dev/shm' is often used to store temporary files by other processes, so take care when deleting/overwriting things in this folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     As noted above, there are many limitations around memory when recording at these extremely high frame rates.  The default size of /dev/shm is only large enough to record 20-40 seconds of video (depending on the resolution and camera version).  The size of /dev/shm can be increased by a few hundred megabytes without issue, however this only gives on the order of a 25% increase in the max recording time.  Frame can be written to flash memory instead of RAM, however this will affect the frame rate.  You can always request whatever frame rate you want, upon inspecting the timestamps.csv file, you'll note that the actual timestamps of each frame won't be consistent with the frame rate you requested if the Raspberry Pi isn't able to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Last week, on a sweltering Monday afternoon, Luke Gerke was pacing in front of his East Village home in Manhattan, engaged in that all-too-familiar pastime: Waiting for a technician to install his internet service.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Only in this case, the rep who showed up wasn’t a uniformed service person from Spectrum or Verizon. It was a smiling neighbor who lives blocks away. Dressed in black jeans and a ball cap, Brian Hall arrived towing his installation gear on a handcart.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Hey Brian!” said Dr. Gerke.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Hall is a volunteer organizer with NYC Mesh, a band of New Yorkers building their own internet service. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Mesh, as they call it, is a volunteer-run nonprofit. Members typically donate $20 a month for a high-speed connection that’s more than fast enough to stream video.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Commercial service providers turned internet access into business, said Mr. Hall, a software programmer who took a career break to devote himself to the Mesh. But that’s not how it has to be. “We’re creating our own network so we can turn it back into a free network,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Dr. Gerke said he’s joining the Mesh because he wants to support an alternative. “I feel like the internet is a human right. I can afford Spectrum, but what if I couldn’t?” the radiologist asked. “What would I do?”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Mesh also includes members such as Linda Justice, a retired East Village artist living on Social Security. She uses the service to send email from her 10-year-old computer.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes if I don’t have money, I don’t pay, and then catch up the following month,” she said. “They don’t bother me or harass me.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Up on the roof of Dr. Gerke’s building, which was sizzling in the 90-degree heat, Mr. Hall unpacked his kit—a roll of cable, pliers, wrenches, a battery pack—and pointed a small antenna toward a larger antenna several blocks south that the Mesh maintains as a hub serving the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Mesh maintains a “super node” antenna and 31 hubs throughout lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn that collectively serve about 350 residences. It recently installed an additional super node in Sunset Park, expanding its territory deeper into Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; Leslie Zhu,  a fellow Mesh volunteer and a grad student studying data analytics, helped Mr. Hall test the signal strength. Many of the 50-odd Mesh volunteers are millennials like herself who are concerned about internet affordability, privacy and neutrality, Ms. Zhu said. They like the idea of a network operating under community rather than corporate control.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Plus the people are nice,” she said. “It’s a great community.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;An hour later, in Dr. Gerke’s apartment, the volunteers drilled a hole in an exterior wall for the Ethernet cable. While Mr. Hall is slim, he had a hard time reaching through a narrow window to snake the wire inside.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Installation usually takes three hours. New members have been paying a $110 hardware fee plus $50 for installer expenses. As more donations come in, the Mesh can start offering free installation to people who are broke, Mr. Hall said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;When it grows to about 1,000 members, he added, it can hire its first support person. Currently, members rely on volunteers to fix problems, a prospect some find alarming.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Indeed, a Spectrum spokesman said its standard rates—which start at $66 a month—represent an excellent value as they include installation by well-trained professional technicians and 24/7 service. Spectrum said it also offers a slower $15-a-month connection to eligible low-income families and seniors. Verizon declined to comment or reveal its Fios rates.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;While it’s still small, the Mesh has come a long way since its beginnings as an informal meetup. It was a struggle to get anyone to join the network, said Mr. Hall, who installed the first antenna in 2014, connecting his East Village apartment to the nearby d.b.a. bar in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Service was spotty at first as volunteers tinkered with network architecture. “Whenever there was a heavy rain, it would go out for a day in the East Village,” Mr. Hall said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Even now, some members maintain a backup connection in case of outages.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;More From Metro Money&lt;/h4&gt;
       
       &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;But the fact that the Mesh is up and running with more than 300 members represents a singular accomplishment. It’s the only substantial community network of its kind in the U.S., said Katie Jordan,  senior policy adviser for North America with the Internet Society, a global nonprofit advocating online access for all.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“We’re very grateful they’re leading the charge and doing so well,” she said. “They’re creating a great model for other mesh networks.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Three hours into the installation effort, Mr. Hall fired up his laptop to test the connection speed in Dr. Gerke’s apartment: “68 megabits down and 69 up,” he reported. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;It was a strong connection, many times faster than the speed needed to stream high-definition video.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“This is awesome,” said Dr. Gerke, who promptly named his wireless connection after his daughter. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Mesh won’t replace Spectrum and Verizon any time soon, Mr. Hall said, but it gives New Yorkers another option. “It’s becoming part of the way the city does internet. You can become part of our community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chrome hides www and https:// in the address bar again</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chrome-hides-www-and-https-in-the-address-bar-again/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Google Chrome&quot; height=&quot;530&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2017/05/03/ChromeLogo.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing Google Chrome 76, if you feel like something is missing from the address bar you would be correct. This is because Google has decided to once again to hide, or elide, the &quot;www&quot; subdomain and &quot;https://&quot; from the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chrome 69 was released in September 2018, Google decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/chrome-69-removing-www-and-m-subdomains-from-the-browsers-address-bar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;strip the &quot;www&quot; and &quot;m&quot; &quot;trivial subdomains&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from the URLs in the address bar. For example, when a user visited www.bleepingcomputer.com, the www would be stripped and displayed as bleepingcomputer.com instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These subdomains are classified as &quot;trivial&quot; because Google feels that it is not information that most people need to concern themselves with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a large outcry from users saying that www.bleepingcomputer.com and m.bleepingcomputer.com are not the same hostnames as www.bleepingcomputer.com, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/chrome-69-removing-www-and-m-subdomains-from-the-browsers-address-bar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google stopped hiding these subdomains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, though, did state that on a later date they would once again hide the &quot;www&quot; subdomain, but would continue to the &quot;m&quot; subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The later date has arrived&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chrome 76, Google has once again started to strip the &quot;www&quot; subdomain and &quot;https://&quot; identifier from URLs shown in the address bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Chrome bug post regarding this issue, product manager Emily Schechter &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=883038#c114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that after testing for several months in the Canary, Dev, and Beta channels, they are going to start hiding &quot;https&quot; and &quot;www&quot; in the Chrome omnibox starting in version 76 on desktop and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cat_quote&quot;&gt;&quot;The Chrome team values the simplicity, usability, and security of UI surfaces. To make URLs easier to read and understand, and to remove distractions from the registrable domain, we will hide URL components that are irrelevant to most Chrome users. We plan to hide “https” scheme and special-case subdomain “www” in Chrome omnibox on desktop and Android in M76.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full update from Schechter can be read below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Google comment&quot; height=&quot;690&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;1041&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/web-browsers/chrome/chrome-76/stable/elide-www/google-comment-str.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when users browse to websites, the &quot;www&quot; portion of the hostname and &quot;https://&quot; is being stripped in the address bar and only the domain is being shown as illustrated by the images below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; class=&quot;noborder&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Eliding www on BleepingComputer&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;565&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/web-browsers/chrome/chrome-76/stable/elide-www/elide-bleepingcomputer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Eliding www on Google.com&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/web-browsers/chrome/chrome-76/stable/elide-www/eliding-google-str.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wish to view the full hostname, you now need to click twice in the address bar on desktop and once in mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge under development by Microsoft does not elide the &quot;www&quot; subdomain or the https:// indicator. This was tested in the Beta (Version 76.0.182.21), Dev (Version 77.0.230.2), and Canary (Version 77.0.234.0) channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Edge Beta&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;532&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/web-browsers/chrome/chrome-76/stable/elide-www/edge-beta.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BleepingComputer has asked Microsoft if they plan on including this change in Microsoft Edge, but had not heard back at the time of this publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Users are not happy with this change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the previous backlash, it is not surprising to find that many users responded that they are unhappy [&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=883038#c116&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=883038#c118&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=883038#c122&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] with this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, none of the replies to Schechter's update have been about seeing this as a positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to show www and https in Chrome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users who do not want Chrome to hide &quot;www&quot; or &quot;https://&quot;, you have two options. The first, and best method, is to disable the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 1: Disabled the &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#omnibox-ui-hide-steady-state-url-scheme-and-subdomains flag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable the removal of trivial subdomains you can follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the Chrome browser and enter &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#omnibox-ui-hide-steady-state-url-scheme-and-subdomains&lt;/strong&gt; into the address bar. Then press &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome will open a page that shows the &quot;Omnibox UI Hide Steay-State URL Scheme and Trivial Subdomains&quot; setting. Change this settings to &lt;strong&gt;Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;./li&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser will then display a prompt that you need to relaunch the browser for the setting to take effect. Click on the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Relaunch Now&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; button and the browser will restart.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chrome Flag&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;937&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/web-browsers/chrome/chrome-76/stable/elide-www/chrome-flag.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you relaunch the browser, www and https:// will show again the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 2: Install the Suspicious Site Reporter Extension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schechter stated you can install Google's Chrome &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/suspicious-site-reporter/jknemblkbdhdcpllfgbfekkdciegfboi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Suspicious Site Reporter extension&lt;/a&gt; and Chrome will stop eliding www and https.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension allows users to report malicious, scam, and phishing sites to be included in Google SafeBrowsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tweet by Microsoft Edge developer Eric Lawrence shows the code in Chromium that disables the eliding feature when the extension is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.823275862069&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;TIL (Thanks Emily!) that if you have the Suspicious Site Reporter browser extension enabled, Chrome 76 doesn't hide the &quot;https://www&quot; at the front of the omnibox. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EhH7ZywpZd&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EhH7ZywpZd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Eric Lawrence (@ericlaw) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericlaw/status/1156664281141669888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BleepingComputer has also independently tested the extension and it does not phone home unless you explicitly report a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 7/31/19 9:15PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature has already been rolled out to everyone. I did not see it as I had the &lt;strong&gt;omnibox-ui-hide-steady-state-url-scheme-and-subdomains &lt;/strong&gt;flag disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have updated the article to include information on using that flag to disable the stripping of trivial domains. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bad_packets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bad Packets Report&lt;/a&gt; for reminding me.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Google Chrome Hides WWW and HTTPS:// in the Address Bar Again</og:title>
<og:description>After installing Google Chrome 76, if you feel like something is missing from the address bar you would be correct. This is because Google has decided to once again hide, or elide, the &quot;www&quot; subdomain and also &quot;https://&quot; from the address of the web site you are visiting.</og:description>

<title>Toshiba Introduces New Tiny NVMe SSD Form Factor</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/14711/toshiba-introduces-new-tiny-nvme-ssd-form-factor</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/14711/toshiba-introduces-new-tiny-nvme-ssd-form-factor</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today at Flash Memory Summit, Toshiba is debuting a new form factor for NVMe SSDs that is small enough to be a removable alternative to soldered-down BGA SSDs. The new XFMEXPRESS form factor allows for two or four PCIe lanes while taking up much less space than even the smallest M.2 22x30mm card size. The XFMEXPRESS card size is 18x14x1.4mm, slightly larger and thicker than a microSD card. It mounts into a latching socket that increases the footprint up to 22.2x17.75x2.2mm. For comparison, the standard sizes for BGA SSDs are 11.5x13mm with a PCIe x2 interface or 16x20mm with a PCIe x4 interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFMEXPRESS is intended to bring the benefits of replaceable storage to devices that would normally be stuck with soldered BGA SSDs or eMMC and UFS modules. For consumer devices this opens the way for aftermarket capacity upgrades, and for embedded devices that need to be serviceable this can permit smaller overall dimensions. Device manufacturers also get a bit of supply chain flexibility since storage capacity can be adjusted later in the assembly process. XFMEXPRESS is not intended to be used as an externally-accessible slot like SD cards; swapping out an XFMEXPRESS SSD will require opening up the case of the device it's installed in, though unlike M.2 SSDs the XFMEXPRESS socket and retention mechanism itself is tool-less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14711/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-05%20at%2011.27.18%20PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14711/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-05%20at%2011.27.18%20PM_575px.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFMEXPRESS will allow for similar performance to BGA SSDs. The PCIe x4 host interface will generally not be the bottleneck, especially in the near future when BGA SSDs start adopting PCIe gen4, which the XFMEXPRESS connector can support. Instead, SSDs in these small form factors are often thermally limited, and the XFMEXPRESS connector was designed to allow for easy heat dissipation with a metal lid that can serve as a heatspreader. Toshiba partnered with Japan Aviation Electronics Industry Ltd. (JAE) to develop and manufacture the XFMEXPRESS connector.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Health insurance companies are useless</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/health-insurance-useless</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/health-insurance-useless</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The most perplexing aspect of our current debate over healthcare and health coverage is the notion that Americans love their health insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bizarre idea surfaced most recently in the hand-wringing over proposals to do away with private coverage advocated by some of the candidates for the Democratic nomination for president. Oddly, this position has been treated as a vote-loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first round of televised debates on July 30 and 31, only four of the 20 candidates raised their hands when asked if they would ban private insurers as part of their proposals for universal coverage: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Harris later backed away, releasing &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-29/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a “Medicare for all” proposal&lt;/a&gt; that would accommodate private insurers at least for the first 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Quote&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health insurers have been successful at two things: making money and getting the American public to believe they’re essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health insurance expert Wendell Potter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She should have stood her ground. The truth is that private health insurers have contributed nothing of value to the American healthcare system. Instead, they have raised costs and created an entitled class of administrators and executives who are fighting for their livelihoods, using customers’ premium dollars to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health insurers have been successful at two things: making money and getting the American public to believe they’re essential,” says Wendell Potter. He should know, since he spent decades as a corporate communications executive in the industry, including &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://wendellpotter.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 10 years at Cigna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurers’ success in making themselves seem essential accounts for the notion that Americans are so pleased with their private coverage that they’ll punish any politician who dares to take it away. But the American love affair with private insurance warrants close inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by examining what the insurers say are their positive contributions to healthcare. They claim to promote “consumer choice,” simplify “the healthcare experience for individuals and families,” address “the burden of chronic disease” and harness “data and technology to drive quality, efficiency, and consumer satisfaction.” (These claims all come from &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ahip.org/about-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the website of the industry’s lobbying organization&lt;/a&gt;, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve achieved none of these goals. The increasingly prevalent mode of health coverage in the group and individual markets is the narrow network, which shrinks the roster of doctors and hospitals available to enrollees without heavy surcharges. The hoops that customers and providers often must jump through to get claims paid impose costly complexity on the system, not simplicity. Programs to manage chronic diseases remain rare, and the real threat to patients with those conditions was lack of access to insurance (until the Affordable Care Act made such exclusion illegal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private insurers don’t do nearly as well as Medicare in holding down costs, in part because the more they pay hospitals and doctors, the more they can charge in premiums and the more money flows to their bottom lines. They haven’t shown notable skill in managing chronic diseases or bringing pro-consumer innovations to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/96681b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2074x1570+0+0/resize/840x636!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2F24%2F73%2Fe2cd011a4d34886e488d87cf549d%2Fscreen-shot-2019-01-31-at-7.55.34%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;pareto&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;636&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Figure-content&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Americans have very little need for medical care in any given year; that's why most people are satisfied with their coverage. But what if they have a big claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image source: NIHCM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers cite these goals when they try to get mergers approved by government antitrust regulators. Anthem and Cigna, for example, &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-healthcare-mergers-20160527-snap-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asserted in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that their merger would produce nearly $2 billion in “annual synergies,” thanks to improved “operational” and “network efficiencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitch has a long history. The architects of a wave of health insurance mergers in the 2000s also proclaimed a new era of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2843722/Anthem-Merger.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;efficient technology and improved customer service,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; but studies of prior mergers show that this nirvana seldom comes to pass. The best example may be that of Aetna’s 1996 merger with U.S. Healthcare in a deal it hoped would give it access to the booming HMO market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://content.healthaffairs.org/content/23/2/43.full.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2004 analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; by UC Berkeley health economist James C. Robinson, the merger became a “near-death” experience for Aetna. The deal was expected to bring about “millions in enrollment and billions in revenue to pressure physicians and hospitals” to accept lower reimbursement rates, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The talk was all about complementarities, synergies, and economies of scale.... The reality quickly turned out to be one of incompatible product designs, operating systems, sales forces, brand images, and corporate cultures.” Aetna surged from 13.7 million customers in 1996 to 21 million in 1999, but profits collapsed from a margin of nearly 14% in 1998 to a loss in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when they don’t happen, insurance merger deals cost customers billions of dollars. That’s what happened when two proposed deals — Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna — broke down on a single day in 2017. The result was that Aetna owed Humana $1.8 billion and Anthem owed Cigna $1.85 billion in breakup fees — money taken out of the medical treatment economy and transferred from one set of shareholders to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Americans don’t like their private health insurance so much as blindly tolerate it. That’s because the vast majority of Americans don’t have a complex interaction with the healthcare system in any given year, and most never will. As we’ve reported before, 1% of patients account for more than one-fifth of all medical spending and 10% account for two-thirds. Fifty percent of patients account for only 3% of all spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most families face at most a series of minor ailments that can be routinely managed — childhood immunizations, a broken arm here or there, a bout of the flu. The question is what happens when someone does have a complex issue and a complex claim — they’re hit by a truck or get a cancer diagnosis, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We gamble every year that we’re going to stay healthy and injury-free,” Potter says. When we lose the gamble, that’s when all the inadequacies of the private insurance system come to the fore. Confronted with the prospect of expensive claims, private insurers try to constrain customers’ choices — limiting recovery days spent in the hospital, limiting doctors’ latitude to try different therapies, demanding to be consulted before approving surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the history of American healthcare reform is largely a chronicle of steps taken to protect the unserved groups from commercial health insurance practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When commercial health insurance became insinuated into the American healthcare system following World War II via employer plans, it quickly became clear who was left behind — “those who were retired, out of work, self-employed, or obliged to take a low-paying job without fringes,” sociologist Paul Starr wrote in his magisterial 1982 book, &lt;span class=&quot;Link&quot;&gt;“The Social Transformation of American Medicine.”&lt;/span&gt;The process even left those groups worse off, Starr observed, because insurance contributed to medical inflation while insulating only those with health plans. “Government intervention was required just to address the inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers wouldn’t cover the aged or retirees, so Medicare was born in 1965. Insurers refused to cover kidney disease patients needing dialysis, so Congress in 1973 carved out an exception allowing those patients to enroll in Medicare at any age. (So much for addressing the “burden of chronic disease.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual buyers were charged much more for coverage than those buying group plans through their employers — or were barred from the marketplace entirely because of their medical conditions. The Affordable Care Act required insurers to accept all applicants and, as compensation, required all individuals to carry at least minimal coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health insurance industry’s most telling contribution to the debate over healthcare reform has been “to scare people about other healthcare systems,” Potter told me. As a consequence, discussions about whether or how to remove private companies from the healthcare system are chiefly political, not practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act allowed private insurers to continue playing a role in delivering coverage not because they were any good at it but because their wealth and size made them formidable adversaries to reform if they chose to fight it. They were sufficiently mollified to remain out of the fray, but some of the big insurers then &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-aetna-obamacare-20170123-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;did their best to undermine the individual insurance exchanges&lt;/a&gt; once they were launched in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as individual Americans fret over losing their private health insurance, big employers have begun to see the light. Boeing, among other big employers, is &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://medcitynews.com/2016/06/boeing-and-memorialcare-contract/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experimenting with bypassing health insurers&lt;/a&gt; as intermediaries with providers by contracting directly with major health systems in Southern California, Seattle and other regions where it has major plants. It would not be surprising to see the joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase try a similar approach in its quest to bring down costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an ironic development, since the private insurers first entered the market precisely by offering to play the role of intermediaries for big employers. But instead of fulfilling the promise of efficiency and cost control, they became rent-seeking profiteers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that it will take years to wean the American healthcare system off the private insurance model; Kamala Harris’ proposal may be merely a recognition of the necessary time frame. It’s true that some countries with universal healthcare systems preserve roles for private insurance, including coverage for services the government chooses to leave out of its own programs or providing preferential access to specialists, at a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the private insurers’ central position in America’s system is an anachronism dating back some 75 years. The sooner it’s dispensed with, the better off — and healthier — America will be. The next time a debate moderator asks presidential candidates if they favor doing away with private insurance, let’s see all the hands go up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It’s worth spending weeks on research before wasting years on a hopeless project</title>
<link>https://ottofeller.com/blog/how-to-conduct-research-and-successfully-launch-a-product</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ottofeller.com/blog/how-to-conduct-research-and-successfully-launch-a-product</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Launching a product without research rarely leads to success, unless you have 50-plus years experience in the market and in the niche of a product. To those who are not that old and not that wise, the following steps will help to reduce the risk of wasting your efforts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find similar products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find as many similar products as you can, and learn how they attract customers. Learning from others is the very first thing you have to do. Maybe the problem you are going to solve has already been solved by someone else. Maybe with a different approach (or tools), it is no longer a problem and you end up solving an artificial issue. Ask your friends and colleagues about how they solve the problems your product is going to solve. Talk about the products they use. Argue with them, but don’t be offensive — try to find out if they are satisfied with what they have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you find similar products, try to discover what they are missing. As mentioned above, there will be situations when you find that your problem is artificial. More often you will find a perfect solution to your problem. But don’t rush the decision about the viability of your product! Thoroughly learn what others do and if they do it right. Often a small detail or a nice little touch becomes a killer feature that persuades a user to buy your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conduct a survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of your friends and colleagues love the product, then you are on your way to implementing the MVP. However, if some of them don’t like the idea, it must be tested on a broader audience. You need a survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the most important part of conducting a survey are the questions. The purpose of the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To get answers about which solutions to the problem are presently popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To uncover the most painful points of existing solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn which features of your product are most valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While preparing the questions, be sure to stay as simple as possible and avoid complex questions. It’s better to have a few short questions than one big question that is hard to understand. Also, don’t forget that no one will take your survey as an obligation — if someone finds it to be too boring or too long, they will just leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have your questions, you are ready to publish them online and finally conduct a survey. There are many tools that provide survey-hosting services as well as a paid audience that will be driven to your survey. One of the most popular tools is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;Survey Monkey&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to paid audience, Survey Monkey allows for very precise targeting. You can even pick the education level or religion of respondents. There are literally hundreds of options! Also, don’t forget that if you decide to go solely with paid audience, then your survey can have many questions — paid respondents have an obligation to complete the survey. &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; src=&quot;https://ottofeller.com/static/349c14bf45650b2c9fbecd0a03fd2291/6ac33/targeting-options.png&quot; alt=&quot;targeting options&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is very small portion of SurveyMonkey audience targeting options &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; src=&quot;https://ottofeller.com/static/1bec6ba3a65daead318a4c4958803420/c1072/targeting-options-marital-status.png&quot; alt=&quot;targeting options marital status&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Seven choices for marital status option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other options to consider when it comes to conducting a survey would be social media, like Facebook, Twitter, or even Reddit. If your survey consists of just a few questions, it is worth trying to combine them into a single message and publish on your social media pages. This works best if you have a large number of followers. If you don’t, then do a paid promotion of the post and drive targeted audience there. But don’t expect a level of targeting like Survey Monkey from Twitter or Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk to a mentor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys are a great way to learn about your idea or product. But it may take time to prepare a good survey that will bring valuable results. If you don’t want to wait, consider talking to a mentor. Find people who are proven to be experts in your product niche. You can even find paid mentorship services online. As part of a paid mentorship, they will evaluate your idea and provide a detailed explanation of why your idea is viable or not. Obviously, this will not be an absolute truth but will give you a very good insight about the weak points of your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have prepared your idea or product to be properly demonstrated to a mentor. If a mentor has an unclear understanding of the product, he will make wrong assumptions that can potentially ruin your motivation. Create a presentation or a flowchart of the core business logic—or even wireframes of the future UI if you are going to build an online product. The following tools should seriously facilitate the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/paper&quot;&gt;Dropbox Paper&lt;/a&gt; — Online tool from Dropbox for collaboration and online presentations. The tool allows creating impressive presentation docs with media, spreadsheets, and even to-do lists. Moreover, it has a lot of 3rd-party integrations that open a lot of possibilities for presenting a product in the best way. As stated above, it was created with collaboration in mind, so you can easily use it for discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whimsical.com/&quot;&gt;Whimsical&lt;/a&gt; — the perfect tool for drawing flowcharts and mind maps. Diagrams is the easiest way to explain a product’s flow. Textual or verbal description will never be as meaningful as a single picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mockflow.com/&quot;&gt;Mockflow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://proto.io/&quot;&gt;Proto&lt;/a&gt; — for creating wireframes of your future product. Actually creating wireframes is the next step, one which is closer to implementation of a product. You will have a lot of iterations with wireframes if your product needs a very solid UX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that it’s not a demo for investors, so your demo can be ugly, but it must not leave a single unclear point about your product. It must be verbose and explicit. Its goal is to clearly explain how it works and how it is better than others. &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; src=&quot;https://ottofeller.com/static/2669af52cbce62940e34f8f7bfd80f72/c0f9f/hotdog-flowchart.png&quot; alt=&quot;hotdog flowchart&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is how HotDog detecting app logic can be clearly described in a flowchart diagram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finally, take the risk!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research is very important, but don’t stick to it forever. You can easily lose motivation if you are not making valuable progress. As soon as there is a chance that your product will find its audience, take the risk and get to the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a list of MVP (Minimal Viable Product) features. Don’t plan too much for the MVP stage, because the product still has the risk of wasting your time and efforts. So, using minimum resources you need to create a couple of core features and see how people react. Don’t miss the must-have features. Having an MVP plan is crucial — you can either pick the right minimum set of features that everyone needs and launch fast, or you can create a product that no one understands, even though it has the potential to solve a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing — you have to forget about perfectionism. I mean it. Your first implementation can be buggy and dirty, but if it solves a problem, no one cares! Conventional wisdom says that if you don’t feel shame after launching a product, you launched too late. Thus implement an MVP, do a quick test, fix some bugs, and launch-launch-launch!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Supercentenarians are concentrated into regions with no birth certificates</title>

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or ‘blue zones’, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and ‘supercentenarian’ status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, which has more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by low per capita incomes and a short life expectancy. Finally, the designated ‘blue zones’ of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status, and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Yelp Is Replacing Restaurants’ Phone Numbers So Grubhub Can Take a Cut</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of an investigation with Underunderstood, a podcast that explores stories the internet missed. You can subscribe to Underunderstood on &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underunderstood/id1470682949&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4KYmu7xnA4CeZB8IRqlYGf?si=By79tydySvqD4vFsqOSIpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, or wherever you listen to podcasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I opened the Yelp app, typed in the name of my favorite sushi restaurant, and clicked on the phone number. Two options popped up: “Delivery or Takeout” and “General Questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s new&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. I dialed the number for “Delivery or Takeout,” which played a perky greeting—“This call may be recorded to ensure awesomeness”—before a woman at the restaurant picked up. I asked why they were recording the call for awesomeness; she had no idea what I was referring to. I asked about the number I had just dialed; she didn’t recognize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What number did I just call?” I asked. She told me the number that was listed for “General Questions.” Then she asked what I wanted to order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the number listed for “General Questions” in the Yelp app is the restaurant’s real number. The number listed for “Delivery or Takeout” is owned by Yelp partner Grubhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042626140-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60323-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1565042626140-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60323-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042626140-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60323-PM.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yelp app lists a restaurant’s direct phone number on the actual listing. That’s (212) 262-8300 in the case of Judge Roy Bean Public House. But when you click on the phone number, this dialogue shows up: Delivery or Takeout and General Questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042662513-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60401-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1565042662513-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60401-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042662513-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60401-PM.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user clicks on the “Call” button labeled “Delivery or Takeout,” they are taken to a different number, (646) 394-9837, which is owned by Grubhub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042710108-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60451-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;1565042710108-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60451-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565042710108-Screen-Shot-2019-08-05-at-60451-PM.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Call” button next to “General Questions” leads to the restaurant’s real number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though restaurants are capable of taking orders directly—after all, both numbers are routed to the same place—Yelp is pushing customers to Grubhub-owned phone numbers in order to facilitate what Grubhub calls a “referral fee” of between 15 percent and 20 percent of the order total, I learned while researching an episode for the podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://underunderstood.com/podcast/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Underunderstood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yelp has historically functioned like an enhanced Yellow Pages, listing direct phone numbers for restaurants along with photos, information about the space, menus, and user reviews. But Yelp began prompting customers to call Grubhub phone numbers in October 2018 after the two companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.grubhub.com/media/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Grubhub-and-Yelp-Announce-Long-term-Partnership-to-Connect-Consumers-with-the-Best-Food-Ordering-Options/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a “long-term partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“It’s not fair because this is our customer who called directly into our restaurant. It’s a trick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurant owners may not be aware of the change. Mohammad Zaman, an owner of Afghan Kabab and Grill House in Brooklyn, insisted the phone number that showed up in Yelp was a mistake until a call placed to the number rang at his desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not fair because this is our customer who called directly into our restaurant,” he said. “It’s a trick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Guarino, CEO of the Manhattan restaurant group 5 Napkin Burger and a board member at the New York City Hospitality Alliance, was also not aware that Grubhub numbers were showing up in Yelp for two of his four restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're working with these companies to help generate orders, but so many times, we're put in a position where we need to compete against them to get access to our customers,” he said. “So many of these practices make it hard to trust the companies. To not have all the practices clearly spoken about and understood by the businesses is really scary in my eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grubhub offers a “marketing” service to restaurants, which includes being listed on the Grubhub platform, for between 15 percent and 20 percent of each order total. It also offers a physical delivery service, which costs restaurants another 10 percent. Grubhub says it provides phone numbers for restaurants that sign up for marketing but not delivery in order to capture all orders that could be eligible for its fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is our understanding that Grubhub has marketing agreements with some restaurants that allow Grubhub to utilize referral numbers on third party partner sites like Yelp,” a spokesperson for Yelp said in an email. She deferred further questions to Grubhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is important to keep in mind that we are a marketing platform and, in almost all of these cases, the diner would not have discovered or placed an order with this restaurant without our platform,” Brendan Lewis, a spokesperson for Grubhub, told me in an email. “The order is the result of our marketing efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Grubhub is claiming that every phone call to a restaurant originating specifically from the Yelp app is attributable to Grubhub’s marketing efforts. The Yelp website does not list referral numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies said they do not measure call volume. However, people have been using Yelp as a directory since long before it partnered with Grubhub. This suggests that Yelp may be driving callers to Grubhub rather than Grubhub’s marketing efforts driving callers to Yelp and then to restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grubhub’s CEO seemed to say as much in March 2018 when the two companies announced that customers could now order through Grubhub from within Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re thrilled to complete our integration with Yelp, which enhances the online ordering experience for diners and will drive more orders to our restaurants from Yelp’s tens of millions of monthly users,” Matt Maloney, Grubhub’s founder and chief executive officer, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.grubhub.com/media/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Yelp-and-Grubhub-Complete-Online-Ordering-Integration/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average user may not understand how this works, either. In June, H. Claire Brown at The New Food Economy reported that the food delivery platform Grubhub has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/grubhub-domain-purchases-thousands-shadow-sites/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creating thousands of websites in restaurants’ names&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes surpassing the restaurant’s own website in search engine visibility, in order to drive more online orders and commissions for Grubhub. The piece sparked a backlash from conscientious customers pledging to order directly in the future in order to protect their favorite restaurants’ profits. Natt Garun, a Verge writer whose parents own a restaurant, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20679021/grubhub-boycott-how-to-seamless-doordash-takeout-food-restaurant-order-direct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a guide&lt;/a&gt; to finding a restaurant’s real contact information and avoid Grubhub’s fees to businesses. This involves dodging Grubhub-owned properties (Seamless, AllMenus, LevelUp, Tapingo, MenuPages, and Eat24) as well as the Grubhub-created websites and the Yelp app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yelp calls may also be concerning to restaurant owners because of the number of false positives generated by Grubhub’s phone tracking system. Munish Narula, who owns restaurants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, sued Grubhub in December 2018 for $5 million, claiming false charges for phone calls from customers asking questions and not actually ordering anything. &lt;em&gt;The New York Post&lt;/em&gt; has also reported extensively on these false charges with a series of stories &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/05/19/grubhub-is-charging-us-even-when-our-customers-dont-order-lawsuit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting in May&lt;/a&gt;. One restaurant in New York negotiated a $10,000 refund for bogus charges, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/06/24/grubhub-repays-one-eatery-10k-over-fee-protest/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dating back to 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grubhub says it analyzes the call recordings to determine if an order has actually been placed and censor personal information. The recording of a call that results in a charge is sent to the restaurant. Grubhub says it retains these recordings and uploads them to the private page that restaurants use to manage their service so that restaurants can audit them and dispute any errors. Grubhub says it does not use the recordings for any other purpose. Grubhub also says only 35 percent of calls placed through the numbers result in charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;The call was a customer who had his restaurant confused with another restaurant. It took four minutes to figure this out before the customer hung up without placing an order. “I got charged almost $8 for that phone call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commissions charged for phone orders are also frequently inaccurate because unlike with online orders, Grubhub does not actually know how much a phone order costs. It calculates its marketing commission based on the average of the last six non-phone orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Martino, owner of the delivery and takeout-only restaurant Ghost Truck, only learned about the phone commissions in July when he was going over his books and realized he was off by a significant amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't figure out what I was missing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He signed into his private Grubhub page where he noticed a few transactions with just a fee and no order total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's a button where you could hit play and so I was like, what is this?” he said. “I hit play, and the first call was me on the phone, which freaked me out because I didn't know I was being recorded.” The call was a customer who had his restaurant confused with another restaurant. It took four minutes to figure this out before the customer hung up without placing an order. “I got charged almost $8 for that phone call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed some of the recordings for Ghost Truck Kitchen and found multiple false positives, where Grubhub charged the restaurant between $7.80 and $7.92 per call for informational phone calls that did not result in an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recordings beeped out identifying information, but one recording included an address and full name that were not censored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants are becoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/restaurants-eaters-please-love-god-stop-using-seamless/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasingly vocal&lt;/a&gt; about the financial pressures they feel from high fees on online ordering apps. New York City council member Mark Gjonaj, head of the Committee on Small Business, held a hearing in June where restaurant owners testified beside representatives from Grubhub and UberEats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grubhub representatives said that it is only driving incremental orders, meaning they are orders that come in on top of whatever business the restaurant was already doing. They also said that Grubhub takes professional photos, increases average order sizes, and gives businesses data-driven advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a restaurant on the Upper East Side that serves sushi. We worked with them and we said that there's a trend for poke bowls. We suggested that they start adding some of these items to their menu,” Grubhub senior vice president Kevin Kearns said at the hearing. “They did this and within one month, they doubled their orders, and within three months they 7x’ed their orders to 1,600 orders a month. This is a small business that went all the way up to 1,600 orders a month, and they actually changed the name of the restaurant to put poke in their name because it works so well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Gjonaj &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/city-council-member-asks-ag-for-grubhub-antitrust-investigation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the state Attorney General to investigate Grubhub for antitrust violations and Senator Chuck Schumer &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/city-council-member-asks-ag-for-grubhub-antitrust-investigation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to recommend that the Federal Trade Commission investigate Grubhub if the company did not refund restaurants for erroneous fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Grubhub if there was any movement to revisit the way it handles referrals based on the backlash to the news reports and in the City Council hearing. “We have never abused the trust of our restaurant partners or built our business through trickery and fraud,” Lewis wrote in an email. “Through Seamless”—which Grubhub merged with in 2013—“we have supported restaurants in NYC for over 20 years, driven billions of dollars in food sales for them, managed millions of care issues on their behalf and institutionalized takeout as a fundamental core of eating in New York.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grubhub did make one change in response to public pressure. It extended the window in which restaurants can dispute erroneous charges from 60 days to 120 days, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/grubhub-extends-refunds-for-fake-fees-amid-pressure-from-schumer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martino, the owner of Ghost Truck Kitchen, complained to Grubhub about his erroneous phone charges. The company agreed to stop charging him for phone commissions unless a call was over 800 seconds, “which is great,” he said, but “also makes you think they know they're doing something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martino gets about 50 percent of his sales through Grubhub. However, he’s hoping to get that percentage down. He now takes orders online himself through his website and encourages customers to order there or through his direct phone number. “I definitely implore people to forgo the three seconds of convenience to help neighborhood businesses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Millions of Books Are Secretly in the Public Domain</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is paying for books when they don’t have to. There’s so many ways to read almost anything ever published, for free, that it borders on the obscene. Libraries: They’re good! Sure, if you want the latest release from your favorite author you either have to pay or wait for a copy from the library, but for millions of older books, you can get a digital version, legally, for free. One secret of the publishing industry is that most American books published before 1964 never extended their copyright, meaning they’re in the public domain today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why millions of books entered public domain with no one knowing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1964, books had a 28-year copyright term. Extending it required authors or publishers to send in a separate form, and lots of people didn’t end up doing that. Thanks to the efforts of the New York Public Library, many of those public domain books are now free online. Through the 1970s, the Library of Congress published the &lt;em&gt;Catalog of Copyright Entries,&lt;/em&gt; all the registration and renewals of America’s books. The Internet Archive &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Library+of+Congress.+Copyright+Office.%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has digital copies of these&lt;/a&gt;, but computers couldn't read all the information and figuring out which books were public domain, and thus could be uploaded legally, was tedious. The actual, extremely convoluted specifics of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; these books are in the public domain are detailed in a post by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;, which recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paid to parse the information in the &lt;em&gt;Catalog of Copyright Entries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a massive undertaking, the NYPL converted the registration and copyright information into an XML format. Now, the old copyrights are searchable and we know when, and if, they were renewed. Around 80 percent of all the books published from 1923 to 1964 are in the public domain, and lots of people had no idea until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to download these free Public domain eBooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amounts to an explosion of new books once lost to the mire of potential copyright claims. And they’re all free. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hathitrust.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hathi Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar to Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;, has already uploaded some of the newly freed books. Leonard Richardson, a blogger and programer in Los Angeles, has been following the saga of the newly public domain books and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;writing about it on his site Now You Can Bruise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the books started hitting the internet, Richardson created a Mastodon bot called Secretly Public Domain &lt;a href=&quot;https://botsin.space/@SecretlyPublicDomain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which posts a newly discovered book&lt;/a&gt; from the collection every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The public domain belongs to everybody,” Richardson said in an email. “I think this is really important in a world where popular culture is increasingly owned by a few companies. You can read a public domain book for free, and you can use it as raw material for your creativity without asking permission. And once someone makes a good electronic copy of a public domain work, it's less likely to be lost forever than an in-copyright work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richardson has already found a few books he’s personally interested in. “I'm interested in computer history, so almost the first thing I did was check for that, but not a lot of computer books were published before the 1964 cutoff,” he said. “The first edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005920453&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The compatible time-sharing system:a programmer's guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was registered in 1963 and not renewed; that book describes a system that's pretty important to the history of computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guttenberg and Hathi aren’t the only places to get free books. Many libraries offer digital and audio books, for free, as a benefit of membership. Reading a classic or a new release can be a simple as getting a library card and downloading an app. “For high-quality electronic presentations of public domain titles I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardebooks.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Standard Ebooks&lt;/a&gt;,” Richardson said. “They're a real pleasure to read.”&lt;/p&gt;
