<title>Reddit&amp;#039;s website uses DRM for fingerprinting</title>
<link>https://smitop.com/post/reddit-whiteops/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://smitop.com/post/reddit-whiteops/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was using a page on Reddit (i.e. the main redesign domain, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com&quot;&gt;old.reddit.com&lt;/a&gt;), when I saw a yellow bar from Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smitop.com/reddit-drm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reddit asking for permission to use DRM&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Reddit want to use DRM? This pop-up was appearing on all pages, even on pages with no audio or video. To find out, I did a bunch of source code analysis and found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s source code uses bundling and minification, but I was able to infer that in &lt;code&gt;./src/reddit/index.tsx&lt;/code&gt;, a script was conditionally loaded into the page. If the &lt;code&gt;show_white_ops&lt;/code&gt; A/B test flag was set, then it loaded another script: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js&quot;&gt;https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js&lt;/a&gt;. That script loads &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js&quot;&gt;https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js&lt;/a&gt; (although it appears to test for a browser bug involving running JSON.parse with null bytes, and sometimes loads &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js&quot;&gt;https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js&lt;/a&gt; instead, but I haven’t analyzed this file (it looks fairly similar though), and also does nothing if due to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; browser bug, &lt;code&gt;!(&quot;a&quot; == &quot;a&quot;[0])&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of all of this appears to be both fingerprinting and preventing ad fraud. I’ve determined that &lt;code&gt;udkcrj.com&lt;/code&gt; belongs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteops.com/&quot;&gt;White Ops&lt;/a&gt;. I have infered this from the name of Reddit’s feature flag, and mentions of White Ops which is a “global leader in bot mitigation, bot prevention, and fraud protection”. They appear to do this by collecting &lt;strong&gt;tons&lt;/strong&gt; of data about the browser, and analyzing it. I must say, their system is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the DRM issue, it appears that the script is checking what DRM solutions are available, but not actually using them. However, just checking is enough to trigger Firefox into displaying the DRM popup. Specfically, it looks for Widevine, PlayReady, Clearkey, and Adobe Primetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; does a bunch of other interesting things, but there’s so many that I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://smitop.com/post/whiteops-data&quot;&gt;a whole seperate blog post&lt;/a&gt; about all of the ones I found. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contains what appears to be a Javascript engine JIT exploit/bug, &lt;code&gt;&quot;haha jit go brrrrr&quot;&lt;/code&gt; appears in a part of the code that appears to be doing something weird with math operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has an obfuscated reference to &lt;code&gt;res://ieframe.dll/acr.js&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used to exploit old Internet Explorer versions (I think)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many checks for various global variables and other indicators of headless and automated browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sends data to &lt;code&gt;vprza.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;minkatu.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks if devtools is open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detects installed text to speech voices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks if browsers have floating point errors when rounding 0.49999999999999994 and 2^52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detects if some Chrome extensions are installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks if function bodies that are implemented in the browser contain &lt;code&gt;[native code]&lt;/code&gt; when stringified
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it get’s kinda meta, it checks if &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is implemented in native code (although it doesn’t go any levels deeper than data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for Apple Pay support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weird. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The stable marriage problem and modern dating</title>
<link>https://www.arvarik.com/the-stable-marriage-problem-and-modern-dating</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.arvarik.com/the-stable-marriage-problem-and-modern-dating</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;This post is a follow-up to the intro post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/visiting-the-stable-marriage-problem&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;The Stable Marriage Problem&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the previous post to understand the problem/solution because this post examines its implications, particularly in the modern dating world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;css-jxtm5g&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-jh295j&quot;&gt;Modern Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;A fascinating consequence of the internet is how much closer it has brought the problem of finding your soulmate, as well as how much closer the assumptions in the original Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) are true in reality. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; from 1962 has assumptions that neither worked then nor now, but it started the discussion on how to best pair people for marriage and any entities for any purpose in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The original SMP assumes that everybody knows everybody so that each person can rank everyone in the opposite gender. This was a clearly unrealistic assumption back in 1962, however, nothing has been a more unifying resource in the history of humanity than the interent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;While the SMP may have been an interesting experiment to replicate in a small closed off town 25 years ago, people are finding other people at a much greater rate and from a larger and more diverse group, allowing the SMP to simulate real life more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The table below shows the top three ways people have met their partner by decade in the past 50 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;css-1hggb4a&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;css-hep4zx&quot;&gt;Decade / Rank&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;css-hep4zx&quot;&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;css-hep4zx&quot;&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;css-hep4zx&quot;&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;1960’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (19%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Family (13%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Primary / Secondary School (12%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;1970’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (21%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Family (13%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Bar / Restaurant (10%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;1980’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (18%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Coworker (16%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Bar / Restaurant (14%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;1990’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (18%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Coworker (15%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Bar / Restaurant (12%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;2000’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (19%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Bar / Restaurant (11%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Coworker (10%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;2010’s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Met Online (19%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Through Friend (17%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;css-15msde0&quot;&gt;Bar / Restaurant (15%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The 2010’s showed a monumental rise in online dating, and the number of people who have met their significant other online is only going to continue to grow. Online dating is interesting in particular because it provides us with a breadth of information on dating patterns in the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;I wanted to see how the SMP actually worked when run through some simulations, and how well it actually models real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;In order to benchmark some variants of the SMP that model real life more accurately, let's start off by simulating the classic problem scenario proposed over 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-jh295j&quot;&gt;Simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;Classic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/classic/stable_marriage_problem_classic.py&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;Python implementation&lt;/a&gt; of the classic SMP solution in order to calculate some initial results on what a 'perfect' world would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The assumptions in the classic SMP scenario is that everybody knows each other and people's preference towards the opposite group is randomly and uniformly distributed. This basically means that everybody has an equal chance to be liked by someone of the opposite gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The standard algorithm was run with different population levels and the number of iterations to find a stable matching as well as the preference rank each person matched with on average was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The latter point is shown in the second graph and is portrayed as the difference between the rank of what every girl got, minus the rank of what every guy got (notice the title indicates an advantage for men, this is because in pretty much all scenarios the man came out higher in the matching, a.k.a the 'reacher')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;Classic Simulation&quot; title=&quot;Classic Simulation&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/474b9d7fdadbfc28b58239ac9a5b8c16/ff59c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/474b9d7fdadbfc28b58239ac9a5b8c16/5243c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 240w,/static/474b9d7fdadbfc28b58239ac9a5b8c16/ab158/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 480w,/static/474b9d7fdadbfc28b58239ac9a5b8c16/ff59c/classic_simulation_multiple_iterations.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;From the simulations we can observe two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The first graph demonstrates the &lt;code class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;O(n²)&lt;/code&gt; complexity of the algorithm. We can see that as the community grows larger, even by a small amount, the amount of iterations it takes to solve the matching problem grows exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;It shows how the difficulty of finding a stable matching between two people grows at a disproportionate rate when population of the community increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The second graph shows the difference in preference ranks for each group of people. It is calculated by examining each matching and seeing where the woman lies on the man's preference rank and where the man lies on the woman's preference rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Since the only difference between the two groups is which group 'proposes' first, we see as an outcome that men have an advantage in this scenario in that, compared to women, they end up with a partner higher on their preference list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The advantage starts off high, and seems to converge at around 13-14% advantage for men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;Preference Manipulated by Dating Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;There are some pretty large assumptions being thrown around in the classic SMP scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;In my opinion, the biggest assumption made is that preference sets are randomly assigned and uniformly distributed. This means that everyone's preference is not correlated with one another's, and that for large enough populations everyone's attractivness is roughly the same (based on how the opposite gender ranks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have an online following of girls gushing over me like Timothée Chalamet does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;css-jxtm5g&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;As mentioned before, one of the interesting ramifications of the rise in online dating is the amount of data we can aggregate from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;OkCupid periodically releases dating information in &lt;a href=&quot;https://theblog.okcupid.com&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;their blog&lt;/a&gt;, and some time ago they released some interesting numbers in how men perceive attractiveness of the opposite sex versus women. The following charts outline the discrepancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;Attractiveness&quot; title=&quot;Attractiveness&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/eb6d66109c1a9307168ab184a3d26d44/7d769/attractiveness.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/eb6d66109c1a9307168ab184a3d26d44/5243c/attractiveness.png 240w,/static/eb6d66109c1a9307168ab184a3d26d44/ab158/attractiveness.png 480w,/static/eb6d66109c1a9307168ab184a3d26d44/7d769/attractiveness.png 960w,/static/eb6d66109c1a9307168ab184a3d26d44/8ba70/attractiveness.png 1202w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;From the data (specifically the dotted lines) we can see two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;2.7888888888889&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Men's ranking of women pretty closely resembles a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;normal distribution&lt;/a&gt;. This is easy to conceptualize as essentially half of women in mens eyes are above average and half are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;5.6824512534819&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Women's ranking of men is more closely related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;Pareto distribution&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the 80-20 distribution. With respect to this problem, it means that if we could quantify attractiveness for every guy, the top 20% of men hold 80% of cumulative attractiveness in the eyes of women. In an unrelated note, Bernie seems a lot more appealing right about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;So how do we change our problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;We can tweak our original code so that each gender's preference rankings are more aligned with their respective distribution of opposite sex attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/distribution/stable_marriage_problem_distribution.py&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;updated code&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look in particular about the shuffling code for preference lists. The new shuffling code applies the normal distribution for guys and pareto distribution for girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;I ran the same simulations again with the updated code and it produced the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;SMP Distribution&quot; title=&quot;SMP Distribution&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/8a6a118e5b9d0f9f88b939c7d421df90/ff59c/smp_distribution.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/8a6a118e5b9d0f9f88b939c7d421df90/5243c/smp_distribution.png 240w,/static/8a6a118e5b9d0f9f88b939c7d421df90/ab158/smp_distribution.png 480w,/static/8a6a118e5b9d0f9f88b939c7d421df90/ff59c/smp_distribution.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;This is the same type of data analyzed from the previous simulation, but with much different results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The first graph shows a similar &lt;code class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;O(n²)&lt;/code&gt; complexity of the algorithm, but the constant value for the graph's equation is much higher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The standard SMP for 1000 pairings took around 7,000 iterations to complete - with the new simulations, the SMP algorithm runs in about 21,000 iterations, or 3 times as much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;This makes sense in terms of the distributions. Since more women now have the same few men in the top 20% of their preference lists, the number of conflicts increases when running the algorithm and causes a lot more men to be dumped and subsequently resume their search for a better soulmate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The second graph is particularly interesting and shows a marked increase in the 'advantage' men have simply for being the proposers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-15rlv7r&quot; readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The increase here stabilizes at around 38-39% and is again around 3 times larger than the advantage men had in the classic SMP scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-0&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;This increase also makes sense because of the discrepancies in preferences between men and women. If the average man was paired with the average woman, the OkCupid data shows that the man would see the woman as average in attractiveness while the woman would see the man as below average attractiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-jh295j&quot;&gt;What Did We Learn From This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;There's obviously many gross inaccuaries when trying to reasonably model the dating world, but the SMP offers an initial glimpse as to why dating is so difficult and why certain tropes exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;Why it's always better to be the initiator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;A clear callout from the analysis is that men end up having the advantage when everyone is paired. There's two main reason for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;1) Societal Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Men are traditionally assumed to be the first group to make a move and it is why the men in the code simulations make the first move. Because men make the first move, the algorithm benefits men as it works in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;greedy behavior&lt;/a&gt; to get them the best possible partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;With respect to the problem, any gender can theoretically be the one to make the first move and reap the benefits demonstrated by the SMP simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;Men initiating&quot; title=&quot;Men initiating&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/12b1e8c06d59f0084bd66da7ba276c81/2d0a6/initiator.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/12b1e8c06d59f0084bd66da7ba276c81/5243c/initiator.png 240w,/static/12b1e8c06d59f0084bd66da7ba276c81/ab158/initiator.png 480w,/static/12b1e8c06d59f0084bd66da7ba276c81/2d0a6/initiator.png 730w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;⠀From WikiHow, I can't really draw this well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;2) Preferences of Men vs Women:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The discrepancy in preferences for the opposite sex between men and women is what caused the stable pairing advantage for men to jump from 13% to 39%. While all other things are held constant, it was the preferences that caused this jump because it all ends up relating to how people &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt; attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The OkCupid data shows that women have higher standards for men than men have for women, and this is the main driver for why there is a larger male advantage when the SMP algorithm incorporated the gender attractiveness distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;I am in no way concluding that women are unhappier with men in their relationships - there are a million other factors including personality, status and chemistry that affect how each person in the relationship views each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, it does lead us to how the outside world perceives the relationships...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;Settlers and Reachers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The show &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/em&gt; was a staple TV show during my coming of age years, and it surprisingly had many apt theories surrounding modern dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;One of the most notable ones was the concept of Settlers and Reachers - as said in the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1k6tdaw&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler. One person reaches for someone out of their league, while the other one settles for someone below theirs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Based on everything we've learned thus far, we have seen that for the most part the men are the reachers and the women are the settlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Once again, this is just a generalization that only looks at pairings of men and women as a whole, and there are always examples that prove the opposite. But in my opinion, it does explain why in so many relationships that &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; see, my initial appearance based reaction is that the guy is punching above his weight class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;And there's plenty of media examples to back this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;Settlers and Reachers&quot; title=&quot;Settlers and Reachers&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/0e176cc26f8667737025c296afbdf9dc/397ed/settlers_and_reachers.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/0e176cc26f8667737025c296afbdf9dc/5243c/settlers_and_reachers.png 240w,/static/0e176cc26f8667737025c296afbdf9dc/ab158/settlers_and_reachers.png 480w,/static/0e176cc26f8667737025c296afbdf9dc/397ed/settlers_and_reachers.png 647w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;⠀⠀The guys really do be having a good personality though&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The observation is also noted by critics as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2016/02/love-tv-attractiveness-gap.html&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;Movie and Television's attractiveness gap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And there's even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;TV tropes article&lt;/a&gt; for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1jvrsgx&quot;&gt;Modern Dating is harder than ever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Lastly, this point is about the complexity of the SMP algorithm and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;You can throw a rock towards any college and it would probably hit a student in an overcrowded Computer Science class who would be ecstatic to tell you all about why an &lt;code class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;O(n²)&lt;/code&gt; algorithm is the worst thing since jorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image css-0&quot; alt=&quot;Complexity&quot; title=&quot;Complexity&quot; src=&quot;https://www.arvarik.com/static/50249191567d762dc0e3c15af2595423/6cd33/complexity.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/50249191567d762dc0e3c15af2595423/5243c/complexity.png 240w,/static/50249191567d762dc0e3c15af2595423/6cd33/complexity.png 366w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;The exponential nature of this algorithm shows that as a given community grows, it becomes exponentially harder to match people in a stable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;If you grew up in Tolono, Illinois, and all you've ever known were the proud people of Tolono, you'll probably find an easier time finding a partner than if you packed your bags and ran off to the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;It is why it was much easier (in my opinion) to find a partner 30 years ago than it is today. Our commmunity has become increasingly global, and we're meeting people from all walks of life through all of our technological achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Of course, this is all undeniably better for the advancement of the human race, &lt;em class=&quot;css-0&quot;&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, it does make dating now just a little bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;css-jxtm5g&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;Did I write all of this to justify why I'm single?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1bkk5q4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ftwBvPWFjpI&quot; class=&quot;css-1l6wkn8&quot;&gt;Maybe, maybe not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;John Coggeshall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 8, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxmint.com/&quot;&gt;Linux Mint&lt;/a&gt; project has &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3906&quot;&gt;made good&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3766&quot;&gt;previous threats&lt;/a&gt; to actively prevent Ubuntu Snap packages from being installed through the APT package-management system without the user's consent. This move is the result of &quot;&lt;span&gt;major worries&lt;/span&gt;&quot; from Linux Mint on Snap's impact with regard to user choice and software freedom. Ubuntu's parent company, Canonical, seems open to finding a solution to satisfy the popular distribution's concerns — but it too has interests to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backstory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux Mint distribution is based on Debian and Ubuntu, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxmint.com/about.php&quot;&gt;providing over 30,000 packages&lt;/a&gt; from these projects. These packages are provided using the well-known APT packaging system used by both upstream distributions. Ubuntu, however, in 2014 started distributing software in parallel to APT using a technology called &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/&quot;&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap is a self-contained package-deployment system designed to make it easier to manage dependencies of an application in a Linux environment. Developed by Canonical, Snap is designed so that its packages contain all of the specific dependencies a software package needs to run, bundled into a single filesystem image. This allows a software package to run on a system that has otherwise incompatible versions of needed libraries, or even to have two different versions of a single software package with different dependencies easily coexist on a single machine. Essentially, it allows one package to be created per architecture that can run on any common Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology solves important package-management problems for Canonical and Ubuntu. It also has a strategic business value, as it allows Canonical-managed software to be installed on a competing distribution. The technology problem Canonical wants to solve is to simplify support for software packages, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;, across the multiple versions of Ubuntu. Relying strictly on APT requires independent packages to be maintained for each Ubuntu version, since various Ubuntu releases ship with different and potentially incompatible libraries. This represents a large workload that Canonical would rather not deal with, and to which Snap provides an elegant technical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a business perspective, widespread adoption of Snap as a universal package-distribution technology would put Canonical in a strong position to control Linux software distribution. This fact is not lost by Canonical's competition — Red Hat supports a similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://flatpak.org&quot;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; technology. Unlike Snap, however, the Flatpak project &lt;a href=&quot;https://flatpak.org/about/&quot;&gt;aims&lt;/a&gt; to be an independent community and a &quot;&lt;span&gt;true upstream open source project, dedicated to providing technology and services that can be used by all, with no vendor lock-in.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems with Linux Mint came to a head when Ubuntu moved Chromium to Snap distribution in Ubuntu 19.10. On the surface, that isn't a problem in and of itself — the Linux Mint project can always start providing its own Chromium APT packages. The problem was the decision to change the Ubuntu &lt;tt&gt;chromium-browser&lt;/tt&gt; APT package itself upstream in Ubuntu. Previously, that package would simply install Chromium directly. With the change, it would instead install the Snap package-management tools first and then install the Snap equivalent of the Chromium package — without making it clear to the user what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior isn't limited to Chromium either, Canonical is &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542&quot;&gt;using this approach on other packages as well&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;tt&gt;gnome-software&lt;/tt&gt;. This decision to use APT to install a secondary, commercially-controlled package-management system, which then installs the software the user wanted, is the center of the controversy with Linux Mint. As was reported on the Linux Mint blog when the Chromium change was made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-installing Snap Store which overwrites part of our APT package base is a complete NO NO. It's something we have to stop and it could mean the end of Chromium updates and access to the snap store in Linux Mint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's at stake and recent events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent decision by the Linux Mint project isn't about Chromium or any single package, but rather about the entire approach Canonical is taking to Snap and APT. Snap packages are effectively black-boxes; they cannot be reproduced independently as the packaging data is controlled by the package maker alone. Further, the Snap package manager is locked into Canonical's library (called the Snap Store) so independent third-party Snap repositories aren't currently an option, either. While Snap packages can be downloaded and installed from other sources manually, doing so requires passing along a rather ominous &lt;tt&gt;--dangerous&lt;/tt&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/3&quot;&gt;According to Canonical Engineering Manager Ken VanDine&lt;/a&gt;, the decision to replace APT packages with Snap is driven by efficiency, and to apply pressure in ways beneficial to Canonical. Regarding moving the &lt;tt&gt;gnome-software&lt;/tt&gt; APT package to Snap, VanDine said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By shipping such a key application as a snap it will continue to keep pressure on to ensure we keep improving the experience while also reducing our maintenance burden for the LTS and future releases of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the Linux Mint project took action specifically when Ubuntu's decision impacted the popular &lt;tt&gt;chromium-browser&lt;/tt&gt; package, it seems this was more of the tipping point for the project than an isolated concern. According to the project, these moves from Canonical &quot;&lt;span&gt;could reduce access to free (as in beer) software and free (as in freedom) software.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; It wasn't a sudden decision either — a year ago the Linux Mint project wanted to find a reasonable solution to the problem by working with Canonical, however nothing seems to have come of those conversations. In fact, it is unclear if any conversations happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is known is that, when Ubuntu 20.04 was released a year later, the APT package that installed Chromium still installed the Snap version without the consent (or necessarily even knowledge) of the user. In response, the Linux Mint project made good on its previous threat; starting with Linux Mint 20 &quot;&lt;span&gt;Chromium won't be an empty package which installs snapd behind your back. It will be an empty package which tells you why it's empty and tells you where to look to get Chromium yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; In addition, Linux Mint 20's APT package manager &quot;&lt;span&gt;will forbid snapd from getting installed.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; The project doesn't appear to be outright forbidding users from using Snap if they want to, but doing so would require &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/06/enable-snap-apps-linux-mint-20&quot;&gt;explicit action&lt;/a&gt; from the user as &quot;&lt;span&gt;by default APT won't allow repository packages [to install Snap] on your behalf.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; Presumably this applies to any package that Ubuntu has migrated to Snap upstream — including both &lt;tt&gt;chromium-browser&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;gnome-software&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the decision had an effect, and prompted Canonical to at least discuss a change in course &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-opens-the-door-to-talking-with-linux-mint-about-snap/&quot;&gt;according to recent reporting by ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;. A representative from Canonical, quoted by ZDNet, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would welcome Linux Mint to engage with us and our community to discuss such topics, as we do with other distributions, and work together going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical's community manager for Ubuntu engineering services, Alan Pope, provided a justification specifically for the migration of Chromium to Snap. The justification, however, didn't cite the idea of keeping &quot;&lt;span&gt;pressure&lt;/span&gt;&quot; expressed by VanDine regarding other packages like &lt;tt&gt;gnome-software&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a single release of Chromium is a significant time investment for the Ubuntu Desktop Team working with the Ubuntu Security team to deliver updates to each stable release. As the teams support numerous stable releases of Ubuntu, the amount of work is compounded. Comparing this workload to other Linux distributions which have a single supported rolling release misses the nuance of supporting multiple Long Term Support (LTS) and non-LTS releases. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Snap needs to be built only once per architecture, and will run on all systems that support Snapd. This covers all supported Ubuntu releases including 14.04 with Extended Security Maintenance (ESM), as well as other distributions like Debian, Fedora, Mint, and Manjaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what if anything comes out of this to facilitate a resolution between the parties. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3766&quot;&gt;In its blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, Linux Mint has mentioned various changes to Snap, such as allowing third-parties to run independent Snap package servers, that might help get to a solution. As the project wrote, &quot;&lt;span&gt;snap could work both as a client and a file format, if it didn't lock us into a single store.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; Doing so, however, would likely run contrary to Canonical's strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to realize that, fundamentally, a technology like Snap would be useful for those who create packages, including proprietary software vendors. The problem in this case doesn't seem to be the technology, but Canonical's sole control over it — and the way it's being introduced through APT. As the Linux Mint project stated in its 2019 post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Snap] was supposed to make it possible to run newer apps on top of older libraries and to let 3rd party editors publish their software easily toward multiple distributions [...] What we didn't want it to be was for Canonical to control the distribution of software between distributions and 3rd party editors, to prevent direct distribution from editors, to make it so software worked better in Ubuntu than anywhere else and to make its store a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately there are multiple interests at play here leading to uncertainty on how things will work out. On one hand, you have companies like Canonical that see the strategic value of controlling the technology behind application distribution, and is using it to apply pressure where it wants to see change. On the other hand, you have distributions like Linux Mint that are prepared to actively block the technology while it is controlled by a single commercial interest. Hopefully this latest move by Linux Mint will prompt a change toward more openness, as a packaging system like Snap implemented in an open way would be a win for the entire Linux community.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;by Canonical on 8 July 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Chris Sells (Google) &amp;amp; Ken VanDine (Canonical)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s goal for Flutter has always been to provide a portable framework for building beautiful UIs that run at native speeds no matter what platform you target. To validate this capability, we started by focusing on the mobile platforms, Android and iOS, where we’ve seen more than 80,000 fast, beautiful Flutter apps published to Google Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build on this success, for more than a year we’ve been expanding our focus to include desktop-class experiences, both for the web and for the desktop OSes: macOS, Windows and Linux. This work includes extensive refactoring of the engine to support desktop-style mouse and keyboard input as well as resizable top-level windows. It also includes new UI capabilities that adapt well to desktop, like Material Density support and the NavigationRail and experiments with deep integration into the underlying desktop OS with experiments in Dart:FFI and access to the system menu bar and standard dialogs. All of this work was to ensure that in addition to being suitable for mobile-style experiences, Flutter is ready to handle full-featured, full-sized desktop apps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been our vision for Flutter to power platforms. We’ve seen this manifest already at Google with products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/Flutter-io19.html&quot;&gt;the Assistant&lt;/a&gt; so now we’re thrilled to see others harnessing Flutter to power more platforms. Today we are happy to jointly announce the availability of the Linux alpha for Flutter alongside Canonical, the publisher of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s most popular desktop Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Flutter for Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, when Google announced desktop-class application support with Flutter, Canonical saw an exciting opportunity to make Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, an attractive target platform for Flutter app developers. Flutter’s native cross-platform story is growing rapidly and Canonical wanted to be at the vanguard. By enabling desktop Linux support in Flutter, Canonical is making it very easy for application developers to publish their apps for Linux users via the Snap Store, the app store for Linux. By making Linux a first class Flutter platform, Canonical is inviting application developers to publish their apps to millions of Linux users and broaden the availability of high quality applications available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of things about Flutter that were exciting for Canonical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast growing ecosystem of application developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple platform support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly optimised native applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern UI framework supporting declarative, reactive and composable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich development platform using Visual Studio Code, Android Studio and IntelliJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s initial announcement started with an alpha release supporting macOS and plans for Linux and Windows. Canonical is making a significant investment in Flutter by dedicating a team of developers to work alongside Google’s developers to bring the best Flutter experience to the majority of Linux distributions. Canonical will continue to collaborate with Google to further improve Linux support and maintain feature parity with the other supported platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flokk: Proving Flutter’s readiness for the desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that Flutter was ready for the desktop, we worked with the designers and developers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gskinner.com/&quot;&gt;gskinner.com&lt;/a&gt; to create an innovative, beautiful Flutter desktop app. Flokk is a real-world app that works with real-world data, specifically your Google Contacts list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTFJcq7UTRY?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to manage your contacts, including searching contacts, adding new contacts and editing existing contacts, Flokk also allows you to associate GitHub and Twitter handle information with your contacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2UcfcBw9YC38-MMQwOLUd86EziSZm_Zh-zAYkjm50chOi-rQchcrKsroz3sb89RjoCi2CziI9omjg-8IGGS1x_gCNQ2d7MrIO8FKKvlShopIh_qjE2Zch9wiFQ_jjzk8z9rNyG33v4D_ZEFmuA&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The display of GitHub and Twitter notifications turns your contacts into your own personal social network. And if you’re not seeing your favorite social networks in Flokk Contacts, then the good news is that Flokk is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/Flokk/&quot;&gt;completely open source&lt;/a&gt;, so you can submit a PR to add your favorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to innovating in the social space, Flokk uses Flutter features to look and feel great. As just one example, the dark theme not only switches the colors but animates the changes as it does so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xCu4lLZ9a-eQ8zF1O0YeO_KBSxJwB-GP_wKFMjVKbGlEmgtEhqf9ROZRBr8QwHM5i4eXBsgqwLH9jux-jl4-iKPFk4DWexaiSTMMnSCMzIHkYUcw84bboIbq-Ue4uuJK885ducrMavuI6sgD7g&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creative team behind the Flokk Contacts app was led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://gskinner.com/&quot;&gt;Grant Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, who’s well known for both excellence in design and implementation of innovative user experience. Grant had this to say about working with Flutter on Linux:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Building the Flokk Contacts app was a breeze! We were able to apply all our previous expertise in Flutter to target Linux with virtually no adjustments, and the app runs fantastically. Working with the Canonical team was a wonderful experience; they were enthusiastic, engaged, and passionate about making Flutter better not just for Linux, but for every platform. It was an amazing project, and I’m thrilled to be able to target another major OS with Flutter.” –Grant Skinner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to use the Flokk app on your Linux machine, you can download the latest release on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/Flokk/releases&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you’re running snapd, you can download the Flokk App from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/flokk-contacts&quot;&gt;Snap Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easy install of Flutter on Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve seen how well Flutter works for desktop-class applications, especially on Linux, you’re going to want to get it running on your own Linux machine. To make that as simple as possible, we’re pleased to provide the Flutter SDK for Linux as a snap in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/flutter&quot;&gt;Snap Store.&lt;/a&gt; The Flutter SDK snap provides everything needed to develop Flutter apps on your favorite Linux distribution. No need to install a bunch of development dependencies; simply install the Flutter SDK snap and your favorite IDE and you have everything you need to create, build and publish your applications for Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you would like to get started developing Flutter applications for Linux and your IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code, this is all you need to do at your Linux terminal:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snap install --classic flutter
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snap install --classic code
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ code --install-extension dart-code.flutter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you also want to use Linux to develop mobile apps, you can do so by installing the Android SDK or Android Studio (which includes the Android SDK). For more information on the Flutter SDK as a snap, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/flutter&quot;&gt;https://snapcraft.io/flutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flutter for Linux desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the Flutter SDK installed on your Linux machine, to build a desktop app, you need to access the Flutter dev (or the master) channel and to enable Linux desktop support:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter channel dev
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter config --enable-linux-desktop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you create a new Flutter project, you’ll get a Linux subdirectory that will enable you to run as a desktop app that runs on your Linux machine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter create counter
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ cd counter
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter run -d linux
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cEyBMSXjosymswv1yeaBbJynlJPN1GZ0EqRiWAIOqZRPoPdwq16khbiSjwiJofPua9AfWv1t9zluDBEPelEVPTsAk5HvfGzgGVhFsJGwleC12mEQezjCV-sBMJ6m50XiCu-gy8tq42qNt9Qu3w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’ll get is a shiny new Linux app built with Flutter running on the latest stable version of GTK+. If you have an existing Flutter project to which you’d like to add Linux support after you have Linux enabled, you can add the Linux subfolder like so:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ cd my_flutter_app
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ flutter create .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create the Linux subfolder with the Runner project that you need to build and run your Flutter app on the Linux desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accessing native code in Linux from Flutter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to supporting the desktop by writing Dart to create Flutter widgets, your Linux desktop apps can also access all of native Linux using &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels&quot;&gt;platform channels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop&quot;&gt;the Dart Foreign Function Interface for C/C++&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you’d like to reuse pre-existing code, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://pub.dev/flutter/packages?platform=linux&quot;&gt;find that code on pub.dev&lt;/a&gt;, Dart and Flutter’s package manager site. Most of the packages you’ll find on pub.dev will be pure Dart, most of which will work just fine in your Linux app. Some packages, called plugins, have native code in them that are specific to one or more platforms. As part of this release, we’ve published three plugins on pub.dev that use native functionality of Linux:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher&quot;&gt;url_launcher&lt;/a&gt;: launch the default browser at a URL provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences&quot;&gt;shared_preferences&lt;/a&gt;: user preferences shared between app sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider&quot;&gt;path_provider&lt;/a&gt;: path information about special-purpose folders, e.g. downloads, pictures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these plugins is available for you to use in your apps as well as examples of how to access Linux natively from your Flutter code, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/url_launcher/url_launcher_linux/&quot;&gt;the Linux implementation of url_launcher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying to the Snap Store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy your Flutter app to the Snap Store, you’ll first need to install Snapcraft, the tool that you will use to build and publish your application as a snap:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ sudo snap install snapcraft --classic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive the Snapcraft tool, you’ll need to create a snapcraft.yaml file in your app’s project folder. As one example, this is the one for Flokk:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
name: flokk-contacts&lt;br/&gt;version: 1.0.0&lt;br/&gt;summary: Flokk Contacts&lt;br/&gt;description: A fresh and modern Google Contacts manager that integrates with GitHub and Twitter.&lt;br/&gt;confinement: strict&lt;br/&gt;base: core18&lt;br/&gt;grade: stable&lt;p&gt;apps:&lt;br/&gt;flokk-contacts:&lt;br/&gt;command: flokk-contacts&lt;br/&gt;extensions: [flutter-master]&lt;br/&gt;plugs:&lt;br/&gt;- network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;parts:&lt;br/&gt;flokk-contacts:&lt;br/&gt;source: .&lt;br/&gt;plugin: flutter&lt;br/&gt;flutter-target: lib/main.dart # The main entry-point file of the application
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the folder with your snapcraft.yaml file, you can now run snapcraft to build a snap of your application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snapcraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, this will produce a file in your current working directory like “flokk-contacts_1.0.0_amd64.snap”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account&quot;&gt;setup your account&lt;/a&gt; for publishing in the Snap Store, you’re now ready to publish your snap:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snapcraft login
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snapcraft register flokk-contacts #(registers the snap name in the store, these must be unique)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snapcraft upload flokk-contacts_1.0.0_amd64.snap --release edge &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will upload it to the Snap Store and attempt to publish it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels#heading--risk-levels&quot;&gt;edge channel&lt;/a&gt;. Once your application is published in the edge channel it can be installed either via the Snap Store Desktop client or using the command line:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
$ snap install --edge flokk-contacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on building your first snap and publishing it in the Snap Store, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/first-snap#flutter&quot;&gt;https://snapcraft.io/first-snap#flutter&lt;/a&gt; for a guided tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flutter Linux desktop samples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flokk Contacts app is an excellent example of a real-world Flutter app targeting the Linux desktop. For a simpler sample, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/master/experimental/desktop_photo_search&quot;&gt;the Photo Search app&lt;/a&gt;, which was also built specifically to show off desktop features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/s_hYnCpVTFD-xrcr1yWgoHa_f0I4U62D5UdSuqxq9pQh-qkHQAtq8lueSykcX3wrdf6PcMyV7wbXCxQ2honfm2kRSmcx0Pqf2vFefgc--kCctE_5HU-zfmqqKeGE7d4uOKlTH6ynrDcgcLDM4g&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo Search is a simple online photo search app that uses several plugins to access native platform functionality, supporting both macOS and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of a Linux desktop app with step-by-step instructions, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-github-graphql-client/index.html#0&quot;&gt;the Write a Flutter desktop application codelab&lt;/a&gt;, which walks you through using OAuth and GraphQL to build a GitHub client in Flutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/803/0*vktUouQPnTpgk0Ko.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image for post&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more comprehensive app that exercises much more of the surface area of Flutter as well as providing several little applets, then I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/gallery&quot;&gt;the Flutter Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, which was redesigned last year to support desktop as well as mobile. If you’d like to see that in action, you can check that out &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/flutter-gallery&quot;&gt;on the Snap Store&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Vp6uVZaw1bpi1Botcp3iAUHC-DITsnbz2NV4cu6era7LNSV34SjijYA7KM6ycI58sM3FeKmvnDCBiQYPV2GXZgYdoWMk3UhKorNPWuYYT2mlfRP4vMPi0ahzPHjwS3a28_8OA47C3z7-ywibUA&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more desktop app shows off the fun side of Flutter is a multi-player game built by Thorsten Lorenz called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thlorenz.com/batufo/&quot;&gt;batufo&lt;/a&gt;. Set against a beautiful backdrop, it allows players from all over the world to compete against each other in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://admin.insights.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/c0c2/batufo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-97022&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorsten has been building this game to support multiple Flutter platforms including Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. If you’d like to see how he did it and follow along with future updates, he makes his coding sessions available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://thlorenz.com/batufo/#watch&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thlorenz/batufo&quot;&gt;the code available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. To install this from Linux, you can pull it down from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/batufo&quot;&gt;Snap Store.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this alpha release and the close partnership between Google and Canonical, Linux developers get Flutter support for their operating system of choice. Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/flutter&quot;&gt;Flutter SDK via snap&lt;/a&gt;. Build and test your desktop app on Linux using Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Deploy your app to the Snap Store. For the latest details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://flutter.dev/desktop&quot;&gt;the desktop page on flutter.dev&lt;/a&gt;. And above all else, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues&quot;&gt;make sure to provide feedback&lt;/a&gt; so that we can continue making Flutter the best it can be on Linux, as we strive to do for every supported Flutter platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter for Linux from the Canonical team is a giant step forward for our dream of making Flutter the best way to build an app no matter what platform you’re targeting. Targeting the desktop has made the Flutter engine that much more adaptable to a long tail of devices that Google itself can’t support directly but for which we plan to continue to build partnerships and to enable the ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever there are devices that need fast, beautiful apps, that’s where we want Flutter to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SUSE to Acquire Rancher Labs</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/suse-to-acquire-rancher-labs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/suse-to-acquire-rancher-labs/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;SUSE&lt;/a&gt;, a major Linux and cloud company, has announced it will acquire &lt;a href=&quot;https://rancher.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Rancher Labs&lt;/a&gt;. Based in Cupertino, Rancher is a privately held open-source company with more than 37,000 active users and 10 0million downloads of its flagship &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; management program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rancher.com/products/rancher/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rancher provides a complete Kubernetes software stack. This stack can handle the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across almost any infrastructure. Specifically, it supports any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)&lt;/a&gt;-certified Kubernetes distribution. This includes Google GKE, Amazon EKS, and Microsoft AKS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rancher stack also enables companies to manage Kubernetes clusters across hybrid-clouds with centralized authentication, access control, and monitoring. With it, you can easily deploy Kubernetes clusters on bare metal, private clouds, public clouds, or vSphere and secure them using global security policies. It uses Kubernetes's native &lt;a href=&quot;https://helm.sh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, or its own app catalog, to deploy and manage applications across these environments. This enables you to maintain multi-cloud cluster consistency with a single deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all being done with a pure open-source stack. SUSE remains committed to delivering 100% true open-source technologies with no vendor lock -n. Rancher, which will continue to run as its own entity, will also continue its open ways and support multiple Kubernetes distributions and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail interview, Sheng Liang, Rancher Labs's Founder and CEO, praised the deal, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition is a launch point for the further growth of Rancher. I feel as invigorated as day-1 about the industry, the technology, and our business. I am so proud of our team and the work they have done these last six years, and I look forward to continuing to work with our users, customers, partners, and fellow Ranchers to build a truly amazing business - capitalizing on the best parts of Rancher and SUSE. Rancher and SUSE together will be the enterprise computing company that transforms our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can feel confident about this because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes has become a core pillar of IT strategy&lt;/a&gt;. It's also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-the-kubernetes-hybrid-cloud-and-why-it-matters/&quot;&gt;foundation for the modern hybrid-cloud.&lt;/a&gt; Gartner predicts that the growing adoption of cloud-native applications and infrastructure will increase the use of container management, and Kubernetes in specific, to over 75% of large enterprises in mature economies by 2024 -- up from less than 35% in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition is SUSE's first step to expanding since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/suse-acquired-from-micro-focus-by-eqt/&quot;&gt;EQT bought SUSE from Micro Focus&lt;/a&gt; and freed it with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-suse/&quot;&gt;sole mission of growth in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. This follows SUSE's strong fiscal momentum. In its second quarter of fiscal year 2020, SUSE saw ACV (annual contract value) bookings increase 30% year over year, while global cloud revenue zoomed 70% year over year.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In a statement, Melissa Di Donato, SUSE CEO, added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our vision to enable better futures and measurable value for our customers and partners guides our decisions and drives our growth. This acquisition enhances our ability to offer a more comprehensive portfolio, greater customer choice, and no vendor lock-in. It will also enable us to play an even more strategic role with cloud service providers, independent hardware vendors, systems integrators, and value-added resellers who are eager to provide greater customer experiences.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_zd_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal should close before the end of October 2020, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. It represents a major step forward for SUSE in the Kubernetes space. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>MIT and Harvard file suit against new ICE regulations</title>
<link>http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-and-harvard-file-suit-against-new-ice-regulations-0708</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-and-harvard-file-suit-against-new-ice-regulations-0708</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;region region-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;block-system-main&quot; class=&quot;block block-system&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-article-content field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following email was sent to the MIT community today from MIT President L. Rafael Reif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the members of the MIT community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, in a surprising development, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will not permit international students on F-1 visas to take a full online course load this fall while studying in the United States. As I wrote yesterday, this ruling has potentially serious implications for MIT’s international students and those enrolled at institutions across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, in response, &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgchart.mit.edu/sites/default/files/reports/20200708-Harvard-MIT-Complaint-Injunctive-Relief.pdf&quot;&gt;MIT and Harvard jointly filed suit against ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; in federal court in Massachusetts. In the lawsuit, we ask the court to prevent ICE and DHS from enforcing the new guidance and to declare it unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement disrupts our international students’ lives and jeopardizes their academic and research pursuits. ICE is unable to offer the most basic answers about how its policy will be interpreted or implemented. And the guidance comes after many US colleges and universities either released or are readying their final decisions for the fall – decisions designed to advance their educational mission and protect the health and safety of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our international students now have many questions – about their visas, their health, their families and their ability to continue working toward an MIT degree. Unspoken, but unmistakable, is one more question: Am I welcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MIT, the answer, unequivocally, is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT’s strength is its people – no matter where they come from. I know firsthand the anxiety of arriving in this country as a student, excited to advance my education, but separated from my family by thousands of miles. I also know that welcoming the world’s brightest, most talented and motivated students is an essential American strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we pursue legal protections for our international students, we will continue to stay in close touch with them through email and updates on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iso.mit.edu/immigration/imm_updates.shtml&quot;&gt;International Students Office’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you may write to the ISO at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:iso-help@mit.edu&quot;&gt;iso-help@mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Rafael Reif&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazing fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) or Webkit via Edge on Windows. &lt;strong&gt;Tauri&lt;/strong&gt; uses (and contributes to) the MIT licensed project that you can find at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zserge/webview&quot;&gt;webview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in making a tauri-app, please visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tauri.studio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;documentation website&lt;/a&gt;. This README is directed towards those who are interested in contributing to the core library. But if you just want a quick overview about where &lt;code&gt;tauri&lt;/code&gt; is at in its development, here's a quick burndown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tauri is a system composed of a number of moving pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;git for code management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github for project management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github actions for CI and CD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discord for discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;netlify-hosted documentation website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major Runtimes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;node.js for running the CLI (deno and pure rust are on the roadmap)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cargo for testing, running the dev service, building binaries and as the runtime harness for the webview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;typescript for the CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;javascript for the JS-side of the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rust for bindings, rust side of the API, harnesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C / obj-c for interfacing with the webviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operating systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tauri core can be developed on Mac, Linux and Windows, but you are encouraged to use the latest possible operating systems and build tools for your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contribution Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start working on something, it is best to check if there is an existing issue first. Also it is a good idea to stop by the Discord guild and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone is already working on it. If you want to read more about this, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation of Rust code and at JSDoc in typescript / javascript code. We autocollect these and publish them using Docusaurus v2 and netlify. Here is the hosting repository for the documentation site: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing &amp;amp; Linting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test all the things! We have a number of test suites, but are always looking to improve our coverage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust (&lt;code&gt;cargo test&lt;/code&gt;) =&amp;gt; sourced via inline &lt;code&gt;#[cfg(test)]&lt;/code&gt; declarations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TS (&lt;code&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt;) =&amp;gt; via spec files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoke Tests (run on merges to latest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eslint, clippy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CI/CD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend you read this article to understand better how we run our pipelines: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobbolda.com/setting-up-ci-and-cd-for-tauri/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.jacobbolda.com/setting-up-ci-and-cd-for-tauri/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;A Graphical Analysis of Women's Tops Sold on Goodwill's Website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by J. Peter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;17.43365253078&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10ish years of second-hand shopping, I've started to ask myself a lot of questions about the clothes I've been buying, like, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Did someone die in this?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Have thrift stores always been this pricy?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (the answer to the former being, &quot;yeah, probably&quot;). In the absense of any conclusive answers, I tried to get the data myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up a script that collected information on listings for more than four million women's shirts for sale through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopgoodwill.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Goodwill's website&lt;/a&gt;, going back to mid-2014. The information is deeply flawed—a Goodwill online auction is very different from a Goodwill store—but we can get an idea of how thrift store offerings have changed through the years. There's more info on data collection method &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodwill.awardwinninghuman.com/#methods&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;74.890470974808&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Are Used Clothes Getting More Expensive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. Or rather, maybe. But if I keep making the &quot;this data is imperfect&quot; caveat, this is going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; piece, so just assume it's there from now on, and I'll address it more in a later section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by finding the change in the median price of a woman's shirt. But overall median price increase only tells us so much. Have prices doubled because everything is getting more expensive? Or are Goodwills just selling more high-price items online? Or fewer inexpensive items?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand how much the &quot;average&quot; item has increased, I found just t-shirts from a few common brands: American Eagle, Gap, Old Navy, Columbia, Champion, Under Armour, and Nike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From July 2014 to December 2019, the &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey green&quot;&gt;median item price&lt;/span&gt; increased from $6 to $11.99. That's almost exactly a 100% increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling down to a few mid-price retailers, we can observe an increase in &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey blue&quot;&gt;median price of t-shirts&lt;/span&gt; from $3.49 to $7.99 (an 88% increase) from 2014 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of due-diligence, I also confirmed that &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey dashed&quot;&gt;adjusting for inflation&lt;/span&gt; barely changes these results at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Median Price of Women's Tops Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;From July 2014 to December 2019, the &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey green&quot;&gt;median item price&lt;/span&gt; increased from $6 to $11.99. That's almost exactly a 100% increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;Drilling down to a few mid-price retailers, we can observe an increase in &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey blue&quot;&gt;median price of t-shirts&lt;/span&gt; from $3.49 to $7.99 (an 88% increase) from 2014 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;In the interest of due-diligence, I also confirmed that &lt;span class=&quot;inTextKey dashed&quot;&gt;adjusting for inflation&lt;/span&gt; barely changes these results at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that suggests that everything is getting more expensive, but it doesn't address our other questions: What's changed about the price distribution of items sold at Goodwill over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;For this, I split the items into three price ranges: under $5, over $10 and everything else. These ranges I picked pretty arbitrarily based purely what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; consider cheap and expensive (because distribution on this is whack, as seen in the chart below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Number of Tops by Price Under $20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Price Distribution of Tops Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the percentage of under $5 items has decreased dramatically after an initial surge just prior to 2016, though the percengage of more expensive items has stayed more or less steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'll note here that the weird surge in expensive items post-October 2019 is more likely due to some data collection issues than an actual change in price, which is discussed again &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodwill.awardwinninghuman.com/#methods&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;For this, I split the items into three price ranges: under $5, over $10 and everything else. These ranges I picked pretty arbitrarily based purely what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; consider cheap and expensive (because distribution on this is whack, as seen in the chart below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Number of Tops by Price Under $20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. What Can Used Clothes Suggest About Fashion Trends?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrift stores are a funny thing when it comes to fashion. It's where your mom dumped your old Champion sweats when you got too cool for them, and where kids cooler than you pick up their vintage Champion sweats now that they're cool again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the meaning of a surge in a certain type of item at Goodwill might be ambiguous, it would be a funny thing to have a huge dataset of clothing item descriptions and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use it to try to find out something about fashion trends, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fashion Trends Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, stream charts. The chart you don't so much read as experience. In this little number, the width (girth?) of each band represents which percentage of tops included a given keyword in their description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I identified these trends by using tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency) at both the monthly and yearly level to find which words disproportionately appeared in a certain period, then selected those that best represent trends. I use the same technique below to look into how people describe brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. What Can Thrift Stores Tell Us About Clothing Brands?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Most Common Women's Top Brands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in life, so it is online: For every untouched Givenchy original, there's a thousand worn out Mossimo sweatshirts. The breakdown of brands over time is disappointing for any hypebeast. That said, the clothes may be absolute &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt; but we're talking clout here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most Common Women's Top Brands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a slightly more nuanced view when we look at how these rankings have changed year-to-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most Common Brands Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to talk price, we might also look at our most and least expensive brands. For this, I used our old arbitrary cut-offs of under $5, over $10, and everything in between to represent, low cost, high cost, and mid cost items, respectively. I mean, here we don't see all that much in the way of surprises. There's still a high number of items from various in-house brands from Florida department store Bealls (namely Coral Bay, Reel Legends, and Dept 222)—the significance of which I'll leave to people who actually know things about business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also check out how brand popularity and price have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brand Count and Median Price Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Select brands:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond just price figures, these data gives us a unique gift: Garment descriptions. You can keep your flowery Mr. Peterman descriptions of safari detailing ready to conquer both the boardroom and the night markets of Morocco. If I want to know how a brand is perceived, give me the ad hoc descriptions of Goodwill employees not obliged to spread the gospel of any brand bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, I filtered out one- and two-letter words, things that were obvious mispellings, and keywords that were only associated with one particular brand. (I'll also take the opportunity to let the reader know that I used regex to determine brand name based on each top's description and there were at least a few mistakes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;brandsToWords floated comparers&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;is disproportionately described as...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wordsToBrands floated comparers&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;disproportionately describes...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;52.688401924105&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. How Does Goodwill Clothing Change By Location?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;FYI, the Goodwill location assiciated with the most sales is &quot;Goodwill Industries of North Central PA, Inc.,&quot; which sold 2,643,509 items in our dataset. That's almost half of all sales, and more than 35 times higher than the next highest selling store's sales. If we ignore that so we can get an actually decent looking graph, we get the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Top Goodwill Locations (Outside NCPA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Also, for the purposes of this chart's labels: GW = Goodwill, GWI = Goodwill Industries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any savvy thrift shopper knows that all thrift stores aren't created equal. My personal approach was always to go to the part of town where the rich people live. But does that strategy extend to the state level? To distribution centres and online sales rather than individual stores? Probably not, but let's pretend. Let's start by exploring how various values change over time by state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colour blocks by:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;FYI, the Goodwill location assiciated with the most sales is &quot;Goodwill Industries of North Central PA, Inc.,&quot; which sold 2,643,509 items in our dataset. That's almost half of all sales, and more than 35 times higher than the next highest selling store's sales. If we ignore that so we can get an actually decent looking graph, we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top Goodwill Locations (Outside NCPA)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hiddenOnBig&quot;&gt;Also, for the purposes of this chart's labels: GW = Goodwill, GWI = Goodwill Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for good measure, let's do that thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pudding.cool/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Pudding&lt;/a&gt; does where we make a map and show the brand most frequently sold there. Just for good measure, we'll throw in a colour scale showing how expensive each state is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overall Median Price and Most Commonly Sold Brand by State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;52.480108991826&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;5. So, exactly how bad are these data and how did you get them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, pretty bad. But, from the beginning, I've been operating on the principle that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; data are better than none for such non-essential questions as &quot;What's the deal with Goodwill?&quot;. So, let me unpack how I got the data and the issues I'm aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, after finding that data of old listings aren't available on the Goodwill website, I went rogue. I set up a script on my computer to crawl through sale item pages on the Goodwill website item id by item id and checked the page name and description to see if it was a women's top. This was a slow process, but I wasn't interested in overwhelming the Goodwill website, and, again, there is no real pressing need for statistics on Goodwill sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I looked for large gaps in consecutive item ids and ran my script to attempt to capture items that I didn't get the first time. Even after all this, there are still gaps in my data, which you can see just by looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Number of Women's Tops Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, for all the imperfection, this method yielded a total of 4,100,355 records of ladies shirts. In my mind, this is enough to do some analysis, even if it's imperfect. For the record, I also deleted instances of items that seemed to be for multiple items sold in a bundle, so the original number of records was somewhat higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more info on methods can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessp/goodwill-trends/blob/master/used_clothing_notebook.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my Python notebook&lt;/a&gt; (which is having some issues rendering online). The short version is that brand and state were determined by me based on the item name and seller name, respectively, and the other data was scraped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was done without Goodwill's assistance or permission. Hopefully, though, they'll see this content as it's intended to be seen: As a very weird love letter to thrifting from a very weird person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awardwinninghuman.com&quot;&gt;More of my nonsense.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model weight for chosen language will be automatically downloaded or you can download it manually from the following links and put it in '~/.EasyOCR/model' folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output will be in list format, each item represents bounding box, text and confident level, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[([[1344, 439], [2168, 439], [2168, 580], [1344, 580]], &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;ใจเด็ด&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 0.4542357623577118),
 ([[1333, 562], [2169, 562], [2169, 709], [1333, 709]], &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Project&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 0.9557611346244812)]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you do not have GPU or your GPU has low memory, you can run it in CPU mode by adding gpu = False&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;easyocr&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Reader&lt;/span&gt;([&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;'th'&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;'en'&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;gpu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are optional arguments for readtext function, &lt;code&gt;decoder&lt;/code&gt; can be 'greedy'(default), 'beamsearch', or 'wordbeamsearch'. For 'beamsearch' and 'wordbeamsearch', you can also set &lt;code&gt;beamWidth&lt;/code&gt; (default=5). Bigger number will be slower but can be more accurate. For multiprocessing, you can set &lt;code&gt;workers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;batch_size&lt;/code&gt;. Current version converts image into grey scale for recognition model, so contrast can be an issue. You can try playing with &lt;code&gt;contrast_ths&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;adjust_contrast&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter_ths&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To be implemented&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language packs: Hindi, Arabic, Cyrillic alphabet, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language model for better decoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better documentation and api&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgement and References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is based on researches/codes from several papers/open-source repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detection part is using CRAFT algorithm from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch&quot;&gt;official repository&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01941&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition model is CRNN (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). It is composed of 3 main components, feature extraction (we are currently using &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Resnet&lt;/a&gt;), sequence labeling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LSTM&lt;/a&gt;) and decoding (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CTC&lt;/a&gt;). Training pipeline for recognition part is a modified version from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam search code is based on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/githubharald/CTCDecoder&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/beam-search-decoding-in-ctc-trained-neural-networks-5a889a3d85a7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And good read about CTC from distill.pub &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
