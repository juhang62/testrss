<title>Rob Pike&amp;#039;s Rules of Programming (1989)</title>

&lt;h3&gt;Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1.&lt;/strong&gt; You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3.&lt;/strong&gt; Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 4.&lt;/strong&gt; Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 5.&lt;/strong&gt; Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&quot; Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as &quot;When in doubt, use brute force.&quot;. Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to &quot;write stupid code that uses smart objects&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Are Currently No Ads on Techdirt? Apparently Google Thinks We&amp;#039;re Dangerous</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200810/11335745081/why-are-there-currently-no-ads-techdirt-apparently-google-thinks-were-dangerous.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;content-moderation-at-scale&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably didn't notice it, but there are currently no third-party ads on Techdirt. We pulled them down late last week, after it became impossible to keep them on the site, thanks to some content moderation choices by Google. In some ways, this is yet another example of the impossibility of content moderation at scale. If we didn't know and understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191111/23032743367/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well.shtml&quot;&gt;how impossible content moderation at scale&lt;/a&gt; is to do well, we might be like The Federalist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200616/14390744730/no-google-didnt-demonetize-federalist-not-example-anti-conservative-bias.shtml&quot;&gt;pretend&lt;/a&gt; that Google's content moderation decisions were based on disagreement with our ideology. That would have allowed us to make a fake story like the one that is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; getting news cycles, thanks to idiots in Congress insisting that Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200625/17375644791/google-threatens-to-defund-techdirt-where-are-all-politicians-complaining.shtml&quot;&gt;defunded the Federalist&lt;/a&gt; because of its ideological viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Google's AdSense (its third-party ad platform) content moderation just sucks. In those earlier posts about The Federalist's situation, we mentioned that &lt;strong&gt;tons&lt;/strong&gt; of websites deal with those &quot;policy violation&quot; notices from Google all the time. Two weeks ago, it went into overdrive for us: we started receiving policy violation notices at least once a day, and frequently multiple times per day. Every time, the message was the same, telling us we had violated their policies (they don't say which ones) and we had to log in to our &quot;AdSense Policy Center&quot; to find out what the problem was. Every day for the ensuing week and a half (until we pulled the ads down), we would get more of these notices, and every time we'd log in to the Policy Center, we'd get an ever rotating list of &quot;violations.&quot; But there was never much info to explain what the violation was. Sometimes it was &quot;URL not found&quot; (which seems to say more about AdSense's shit crawler than us). Sometimes it was &quot;dangerous and derogatory content.&quot; Sometimes it was &quot;shocking content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that would be about it. One difference, however, was that in the past Google would say that we didn't need to fix those flagged URLs and that they would just stop showing ads on those pages. Which is fine. They don't want their ads appearing there, no problem. But, many of these new &quot;policy violations&quot; said they were &quot;must fix&quot; issues. But what that &quot;fix&quot; sould be was never explained. Incredibly, this included a non-existent URL (a malformed URL that would just take you to the front page of Techdirt). That was deemed &quot;must fix.&quot; Also, somewhat amusingly, the tag page &lt;em&gt;for Google&lt;/em&gt; was deemed &quot;dangerous or derogatory&quot; and &quot;must fix&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/Wjl7RWD&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Wjl7RWD.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with the tag page for &quot;content moderation.&quot; I only wish I were joking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/fulx4RF&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fulx4RF.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, what you see there was basically all of the information given to us. How do we &quot;fix&quot; that? Who the fuck knows? Again, I do not think that this is Google targeting us for our views (even when we have been critical of Google or Google's content moderation practices). It just seems to be that content moderation is impossible to do well, and Google is a prime example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, this list of problematic URLs would just keep changing. Some would drop off the list with no explanation (even the &quot;must fix&quot; ones). Some new ones would be added. Some would switch between &quot;must fix&quot; and &quot;don't need to fix.&quot; No explanation. No record of the &quot;fixes.&quot; As an example, on Friday July 31st, I logged in and saw 25 URLs deemed to be policy violations. On Saturday morning I logged in and it was down to 18. No reason. Sunday morning it was at 22. But Sunday evening it was 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to reach out to people at AdSense to figure out what the hell we should do and did not get back anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three other things happened around this time as well. First, on the same day we started receiving these daily (or multiple times daily) policy violation emails, Google &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; started claiming that our daily emails (which are just snapshots of the blog itself) were &lt;strong&gt;phishing attempts&lt;/strong&gt;, and automatically deleting them from any G Suite user's email account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/XFwWCoT&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XFwWCoT.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users of Gmail (not G Suite) it just moved our newsletters to spam, still claiming they were &lt;strong&gt;phishing&lt;/strong&gt; attempts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/DCh2Ns8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DCh2Ns8.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the emails don't ask users to do anything or to log in to anything. They're not phishing. They're just an email version of the day's blog posts. We didn't see how these two things (the AdSense violations and the accusations of &quot;phishing&quot;) could possibly be connected, so it might just be a coincidence that they started the exact same day -- but, again, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing that happened was that the company we work with to manage the ad flow on our website (and to bring in other sources, beyond Google ads) told us that Google had reached out to &lt;strong&gt;them&lt;/strong&gt; (not us) to say that because of all of the ongoing unfixed &quot;policy&quot; violations, we would be kicked out of AdSense by the end of August. Also, Google told them that we were engaging in &quot;clickspam&quot; by hiding our ads to make them look like regular content, and that needed to be fixed immediately. The problem is -- we don't do that and have never done that. Our ads were always in the right hand column and clearly called out as ads. Indeed, we pay attention to what other sites do, and we are way, way, way, way more careful than basically &lt;strong&gt;every other website on the planet&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to not shoving our ads where they might be mistaken as organic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we started receiving reports from multiple Techdirt visitors (including those who told us they had purposefully whitelisted Techdirt from their ad blockers) that ads being delivered by Google were causing their computers to run hot. Multiple reports of ads on Techdirt failing to load properly, and causing Techdirt to fail to load properly. And also causing fans to turn on. And, to be honest, that's the last straw for us. We would try to work with Google to understand why our content is so problematic for it, but when Google's products start harming our users and causing a nuisance for them, that's when they've got to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, we just decided that we're pulling the ads off the site entirely for the time being -- at least until we can figure out a better situation. This (obviously) represents a revenue hit for us, but the situation had become impossible to deal with. I was wasting so much time the past few weeks trying to figure out what the hell we were supposed to do, as opposed to doing the work I needed to be doing. So, that's it for now. We're looking at other providers out there, but so far, so many of the ones we talk to appear to be sketchy, and we're not doing that either. If anyone knows of any non-sketchy, non-awful advertising partners, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/contact.php&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you happen to have some excess money and want to just sponsor stuff so we don't even have to worry about regular ads, let us know. Assuming most of you are not in that position, we do have a page of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/pages/support.php&quot;&gt;various ways individuals can support us&lt;/a&gt;. We know that times are tough for many, many people right now, but if you happen to be doing okay, and can help us replace at least a little of what money we made from ads, that would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>70% of surveyed Americans say they can&amp;#039;t do their job without internet</title>
<link>https://decisiondata.org/news/70-of-surveyed-americans-say-we-cant-do-our-jobs-without-a-home-internet-connection/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://decisiondata.org/news/70-of-surveyed-americans-say-we-cant-do-our-jobs-without-a-home-internet-connection/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We asked 950 currently employed Americans whether or not their jobs required a home internet connection. Here's what we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most currently employed Americans (over 71.5%) say they could not perform their jobs without a home internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pandemic contributed to this reality with 7.7% of respondents saying their jobs only recently required home internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 28% of respondents said they could do their current job without a home internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3792383&quot; srcset=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1.png 677w, https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1-300x186.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20%20%22%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot; data-src=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lazyload wp-image-3792383&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1.png 677w, https://decisiondata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Could-you-do-your-job-occupation-career-etc-without-a-strong-internet-connection-at-home_-1-300x186.png 300w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Home Internet Essentially a Requirement for Most Jobs These Days?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are old enough to remember a time when work was mostly done &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; work and home life was mostly done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allconnect.com/blog/secure-internet-for-freelancers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;at home (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; home&lt;/a&gt;. But the lines between home and work are blurring and that effect is being accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Many have argued&lt;/a&gt; that since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/internet/cheap/&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; is such an essential part of our economy now that it should be a top government priority to ensure access for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users, conducted for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;BBC World Service&lt;/a&gt; between Nov. 30, 2009 and Feb. 7, 2010 found that almost four in five internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the internet was a fundamental right. 50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We polled 950 Americans who are currently employed. There are certainly some folks who work in healthcare, grocery stores, auto shops, etc., where you wouldn't think a strong home internet connection was a requirement. But if you ask those workers, they'll tell you they have a work email they check often, work nights from home on clerical items and likely feel like their job now requires access to the web these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only adds to the argument though, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://decisiondata.org/news/how-to-optimize-your-internet-for-working-from-home/&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; should, at least to some extent, be available to all Americans wherever it is technologically possible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Raise Less Money</title>
<link>https://www.aaronkharris.com/raise-less-money</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.aaronkharris.com/raise-less-money</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I’ve noticed that good companies are increasingly over-diluting themselves in their seed and A rounds. Counterintuitively, dilution seems to rise along with price. One would expect the opposite correlation. Strong founders who command high prices should be using that higher price to sell less of their companies in exchange for money to grow. As I’ve tried to understand what’s going on, I’ve tried several arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the last week, I’ve come to understand an error I’ve been making when talking to founders about how much money to raise. I realized that the conversation about raising always anchors back to the idea of adding “months of runway.” That always seemed appropriate to me because it was a measure of the amount of time a company had to stay alive. Staying alive seemed good since it increased the time a company had to find product market fit and to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I now realize that this is the wrong framing because simply staying alive is an inadequate goal for a company.  Founders start companies to find product market fit and grow. Venture capital is designed to speed growth, not to extend runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, in recent conversations, I’ve started to ask founders: “How much could you get done in the next 12 months with the amount of capital you are planning to raise? If you’re a good company, you’re either going to raise your Series A - or Series B - in the next 12 months or have significant revenue such that you won’t need more capital.[1] If you’re doing badly, why would you want to keep working on this for 24 or 36 months? That’s a waste of your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders who raise too much capital are acting out of fear rather than acting out of confidence. This fear made sense ten years ago when seed financing was relatively scarce. This is when much of the fundraising advice I read as a founder was written. However, the world has changed and so should the advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing is more accessible to good founders than it has ever been.[2] Confident, competent founders should take the risk of running out of money vs. the certainty of over-dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good founders respond to this framework as it shifts the argument from one in which “winning” is about adding months of runway to the bank to one in which “winning” is fast and high quality execution - as evidenced by hitting milestones. It’s also easy to draw a straight line from this framing to the best companies. When a company raises a Series A nine months after launch - or Demo Day - with 80% of its seed funds in the bank, it’s apparent that those founders sold too much.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A founder’s decision on how much money to raise in any given round is more art than science. It is a fraught decision since it necessarily forces founders to make predictions about the future. There is no perfect answer, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/library/3P-how-to-optimize-your-fundraising-round&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over-optimizing&lt;/a&gt; around any single factor is a mistake. However, it seems clear that shifting the goal of fundraising from adding runway to progress would limit both the amount of money companies believe they need and the dilution that founders take in the process of building successful startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] And if this is true, investors will chase you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Even during COVID. I did not expect this to be true, however, this market is one of the most active I've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] Seeing this dynamic on a regular basis while running YC's Series A program is what led me to realize my mistake. Without fail, the founders raising the most competitive rounds have the most capital left, and thereby the most unnecessary dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to Daniel Gackle and Michael Seibel for your thoughts and edits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber CEO says its service will probably shut down temporarily in California</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/12/uber-may-shut-down-temporarily-in-california.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/12/uber-may-shut-down-temporarily-in-california.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;InlineImage-imageEmbed hasBkg&quot; id=&quot;ArticleBody-InlineImage-105906367&quot; data-test=&quot;InlineImage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;InlineImage-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber Technologies CEO Dara Khosrowshahi outside the New York Stock Exchange ahead of the company's IPO, May 10, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;30.788403614458&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UBER&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; would likely shut down temporarily for several months if a court does not overturn a recent ruling requiring it to classify its drivers as full-time employees, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Stephanie Ruhle on Wednesday on MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the court doesn't reconsider, then in California, it's hard to believe we'll be able to switch our model to full-time employment quickly,&quot; Khosrowshahi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber and rival &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LYFT&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; both have about a week left to appeal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-requiring-uber-and-lyft-to-stop-classifying-drivers-as-contractors.html&quot;&gt;preliminary injunction granted by a California judge on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that will prohibit the companies from continuing to classify their drivers as independent workers. Following the order will require Uber and Lyft to provide benefits and unemployment insurance for workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California's attorney general and three city attorneys &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/california-ag-cities-sue-uber-and-lyft-over-worker-classification.html&quot;&gt;brought the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the companies under the state's new law, Assembly Bill 5, that aims to provide benefits to gig workers core to a company's business by classifying them as employees. In his decision granting the preliminary injunction, the judge rejected the notion that drivers should be considered outside the course of the companies' businesses, calling the logic &quot;a classic example of circular reasoning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft both said they would appeal the ruling during the 10-day period before it goes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;25.950882578665&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than classify drivers as employees, Khosrowshahi has advocated for what he calls a &quot;third way&quot; that would maintain drivers' independence while allowing companies to provide some protections without risking being viewed as full-time employers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/opinion/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-gig-workers-deserve-better.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In a New York Times op-ed ahead of the court ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Khosrowshahi said gig companies such as Uber could pay into a fund that workers could dip into for paid time off or health-care benefits based on the number of hours they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday that his Plan B if Uber can't win on appeal would be to temporarily pause service in California. While he said Uber would later resume service in the state, it would likely be more centered in cities, which could mean limited availability in less concentrated areas such as suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the appeal doesn't work out for Uber, it will be banking on voters to determine its fate. Khosrowshahi said if that's the case, the service would likely shut down in California until November, when voters in the state decide on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proposition 22,&lt;/a&gt; which would exempt drivers for app-based transportation and delivery companies from being considered employees. Uber has argued its drivers prefer working as independent contractors, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=becerra+cnbc&amp;amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS887US887&amp;amp;amp;oq=becerra+cnbc&amp;amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1870j0j7&amp;amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;California AG Xavier Becerra rejected that claim as a &quot;bogus argument.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;21.54954954955&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi emphasized that pausing service in the state would leave thousands of drivers without the income they would typically earn from Uber. Still, ridership has been down during the pandemic anyway, which the judge said made the injunction come at what is perhaps &quot;the least worst time&quot; for Uber and Lyft to adjust their business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becerra said in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday that he was unconcerned about the potential for Uber to leave the state as a result of the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any business model that relies on shortchanging workers in order to make it probably shouldn't be anywhere, whether California or otherwise,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla laying off their devtools people is a massive blow. The excellent devtools were a good., non-ideological reason for developers to use Firefox as part of their daily work, &amp;amp; thus test in it &amp;amp; care about it. Moz had long given up on any other developer relations activities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China hires over 100 TSMC engineers in push for chip leadership</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-hires-over-100-TSMC-engineers-in-push-for-chip-leadership</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-hires-over-100-TSMC-engineers-in-push-for-chip-leadership</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI -- Two Chinese government-backed chip projects have together hired more than 100 veteran engineers and managers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Taiwan-Semiconductor-Manufacturing-Co.-Ltd&quot;&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the world's leading chipmaker, since last year, multiple sources have told the Nikkei Asian Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hirings are aimed at helping Beijing achieve its goal of fostering a domestic chip industry in order to cut China's reliance on foreign suppliers, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quanxin Integrated Circuit Manufacturing (Jinan), better known as QXIC, and Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or HSMC, along with their various associate and affiliate companies, are little-known outside the industry. But in addition to employing more than 50 former TSMC employees each, both are also led by ex-TSMC executives with established reputations in the chip world. The two projects are aiming to develop 14-nanometer and 12-nanometer chip process technologies, which are two to three generations behind TSMC but still the most cutting-edge in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hongxin and QXIC, founded in 2017 and 2019, respectively, are part of a recent boom in China's semiconductor industry as Beijing prioritizes self-sufficiency in key tech areas &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/How-China-s-chip-industry-defied-the-coronavirus-lockdown&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;impacted by tensions&lt;/a&gt; with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China boasts the world's most new or planned chip plants and is expected to top other countries in chipmaking equipment spending, an indicator of investment for future chip facilities, in 2020 and 2021, according to SEMI, an industry organization. The country's top contract chipmaker, state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co., recently raised its &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-s-top-chipmaker-ups-capex-to-6.7bn-after-bumper-quarter&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;capital spending&lt;/a&gt; for the second time this year to $6.7 billion for 2020. It also announced it will build a $7.6 billion joint-venture factory with Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, a state-backed high-tech zone, in another sign of strong government support for chip producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many emerging semiconductor projects, like QXIC and Hongxin, are supported by local governments, and are keen to prove to Beijing that they are contributing to the national semiconductor project, fueling fierce competition and a hunt for top talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world's biggest contract chipmaker, TSMC has been the most high-profile target for Chinese chip projects looking to secure talent, sources told Nikkei. The Taiwanese company is a key supplier to world's top tech names, including Apple, Huawei, Qualcomm and Google, and its production &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Intel-falls-behind-Asian-rival-TSMC-in-chip-race&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;capabilities have surpassed&lt;/a&gt; those of U.S. chip giant Intel, the longtime industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hongxin offered some amazing packages, as high as two to 2.5 times TSMC's total annual salary and bonuses for those people,&quot; said a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC is very concerned about the talent outflow even though the loss may not immediately impact its leading position in the industry, sources told Nikkei. The company is concerned its trade secrets could be transferred to those emerging Chinese players and even asked chip-production equipment makers to sign a renewed pledge that they will not sell any customized tools for TSMC to the Chinese projects, the sources added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC was uncomfortable when QXIC began operating a research and development base not far from the Taiwanese company's most advanced 5-nanometer plant in south Taiwan, one of the people familiar with the matter told Nikkei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;China has become very smart and now they only target those industry talents who have worked at leading industry players, and TSMC is their top target. ... Previously, they welcome most talents from all kinds of chip companies,&quot; a longtime headhunter, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told Nikkei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has lost more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Taiwan-loses-3-000-chip-engineers-to-Made-in-China-2025&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;3,000 chip engineers&lt;/a&gt; to China, Nikkei earlier reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while TSMC may be the prime target, other chip companies may also be at risk of a brain drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chip titan TSMC may not feel the immediate pain when they lose 100 employees, but some smaller chip developers could crash if they lose several dozens of staff,&quot; a chip industry executive told the Nikkei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All these Asian governments, including the Taiwanese government, need to think up good ways to retain talent, since China can use its great capital market, government subsidies and lucrative packages to attract workers,&quot; the executive said. &quot;You can't expect your employees to be loyal forever if you did not offer enough incentives and opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Wang, a tech analyst with research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said Chinese chip companies have been able to hire large numbers of Taiwanese and South Korean engineers, at both junior and executive levels. &quot;They offer generous compensation packages and growth opportunities to engineers who would have less room for advancement by staying put,&quot; Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these Chinese projects have their own problems, too. Although they have hired some top talent from industry leaders, building a chip industry from scratch is still extremely challenging. Success requires a continuous supply of good talent, a wealth of experience, long learning curves, and abundant financial resources, market watchers and industry executives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;China's chip talent is still extremely insufficient, as it is building many big projects at the same time. Not having enough talent is also a bottleneck for semiconductor development,&quot; said Roger Sheng, a semiconductor analyst with research company Gartner. &quot;These Chinese chip projects have to fight against each other to recruit talent and cultivating that talent, especially in microelectronics, really takes time. It's not that easy just to hire some leaders and then suddenly you can build and run such advanced chip facilities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hongxin, which is based in Wuhan, has also faced some capital issues recently, as it did not immediately receive enough financial support from investors and local government, sources said. The company plans to build a 128 billion yuan ($18.4 billion) project to produce 14-nanometer chips by 2022, and also has a tech roadmap to develop even more advanced 7-nanometer chips, Nikkei learned, but those plans could now face delays because of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSMC's investors include Wuhan local government and a real estate developer in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, who is not familiar with how chips are fabricated, according to people familiar with the matter, and &quot;this could also cause some communication issues, which could lead to delay of development.&quot; Chinese media reported that Hongxin CEO Chiang Shang-yi -- TSMC's former COO and a widely recognized leader in research and development -- was thinking about resigning from the project as there are many challenges ahead, but later the company dismissed those reports as speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QXIC, on the other hand, is 80% controlled by another little-known company, Yixin Integrated Technology. Based in the southern Chinese port city of Zhuhai, Yixin claims on its company website that it has more than 370 top chip industry experts and can collaborate with any company, research institute, and chip plant investment and construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC, in a response to Nikkei's request for comments, stressed its low turnover rate and commitment to fostering a talented workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Employees are TSMC's most important assets. We are committed to offering employees a challenging and positive work environment, and long-term career development. ... Our annual turnover rate is less than 5% in recent years. We will continue to work to retain and cultivate our internal talent pool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would take &quot;appropriate actions&quot; to protect its intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a company, TSMC competes to our fullest within the law, but we do not slander our competitors and we respect the intellectual property rights of others. Similarly, we expect our suppliers and other companies to respect TSMC's intellectual property rights and will take appropriate protective actions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSMC CEO Chiang declined to comment for this story. QXIC did not respond to Nikkei's request for comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Nikkei staff writer Lauly Li&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Joan Feynman has died</title>
<link>https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/feynman.cfm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/feynman.cfm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Born in 1927, Feynman grew up in Queens, New York, alongside her older brother Richard, nine years her senior, who would eventually become one of the world’s most well-known physicists. He would become Joan's first teacher and someone who fostered her inquisitive nature, believing her capable of learning all the math and science he could teach her. In her 2018 talk, Feynman recounted early memories of solving math problems for the unique reward of getting to pull her brother’s hair and serving as his &quot;lab assistant&quot; at the age of five. A late-night trip to the golf course near the Feynman family home to see an aurora inspired Feynman’s curiosity and would eventually guide her research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her fourteenth birthday, Richard gave Feynman a copy of &lt;em&gt;Astronomy&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Horace Baker, a college-level physics text, that both taught her about physics and what was possible: Feynman credited a figure attributed to Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin for proving to her that women could indeed have a career doing science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman would go on to receive a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin College, and she attended Syracuse University, studying condensed matter theory and earning a PhD in 1958. By 1960, Feynman was married with two children and, having not secured the kind of research position she was looking for, she decided to take a break from physics to take on the role of homemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The break was short-lived, as Feynman grew depressed from the drudgery of keeping a home and caring for two small children: In 1962, at the advice of a therapist, she went in search of employment, securing three job offers at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. At Lamont, where she worked part-time, Feynman began her research into Earth’s magnetosphere, identifying its shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Feynman accepted a job at the NASA Ames Research Center, where she developed a way to detect solar coronal mass ejections from the sun by searching for the presence of helium in solar wind. She would go on to hold positions at the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado; the National Science Foundation; and Boston College. In 1985, Feynman accepted a position at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, where she would conduct research until her retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of her research at JPL, Feynman identified the mechanism that leads to the formation of auroras and developed a statistical model to determine the number of high-energy particles expelled from coronal mass injections that would hit a spacecraft during its lifetime. After her retirement from a senior scientist position in 2003, Feynman continued to conduct research on the impact of solar activity on the early climate of the Earth and the role of climate stabilization in the development of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Joan Feynman leaves a legacy of exemplary scientific research, having made important contributions to our understanding of the solar wind, the earth’s magnetosphere, and the origin of auroras,&quot; said APS CEO Kate Kirby. &quot;Despite being discouraged to pursue science by women in her family, she persevered, and her accomplishments serve as an inspiration to women who wish to pursue a career in science.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Hello hackers. What would be your advice for Belarus protesters to keep connected to each other and the rest of the world.There are some solutions for short-range communication (e.g. https://briarproject.org/), but what are the solutions for the mid-range (e.g. city) and long-range (hundreds of kilometers) communication? I suppose the HAM radio could be used for that or AMPRNet. Any ideas how to provide low-cost, decentralized, communication infrastructure for the time when internet is cut off?&lt;/td&gt;
