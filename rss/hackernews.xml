<title>Hard Startups</title>
<link>https://blog.samaltman.com/hard-startups</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.samaltman.com/hard-startups</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The most counterintuitive secret about startups is that it’s often easier to succeed with a hard startup than an easy one.  A hard startup requires a lot more money, time, coordination, or technological development than most startups. A good hard startup is one that will be valuable if it works (not all hard problems are worth solving!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when Instagram started to get really popular—it felt like you couldn’t go a day without hearing about another photo sharing startup.  That year, probably over 1,000 photo sharing startups were funded, while there were fewer than ten nuclear fusion startups in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It’s usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join—you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few recruiting messages are as powerful (when true) as “the world needs this, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a derivative of the Peter Principle at play here—your startup will rise to the level where it can no longer attract enough talented people.  (This sometimes holds true for careers too—the limiting factor for many careers eventually becomes how many talented people you know and can get to work with you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy startup is a headwind; a hard startup is a tailwind.  If people care about your success because you seem committed to doing something significant, it’s a background force helping you with hiring, advice, partnerships, fundraising, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the magic of Silicon Valley is that people default to taking you seriously if you’re willing to be serious—they’ve learned it’s a very expensive mistake, in aggregate, not to.  If you want to start a company working on a better way to build homes, gene editing, artificial general intelligence, a new education system, or carbon sequestration, you may actually be able to get it funded, even if you don’t have a degree or much experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let yourself become more ambitious—figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step. You don’t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing.  Most people aren’t, which is part of the reason they pick “easy” startups.  In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you’re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you’ll have a very large edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Luke Miles for reviewing drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Another solution to this problem is to think about startups that can become quite successful with less than ten people.  As compensation packages from the giant tech companies continue to increase, I suspect this will become a trend.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DOJ plans to strike against encryption while the Techlash iron is hot</title>
<link>https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/02/doj-plans-strike-against-encryption-while-techlash-iron-hot</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/02/doj-plans-strike-against-encryption-while-techlash-iron-hot</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a story in today’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Washington Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2020/02/25/the-cybersecurity-202-the-justice-department-is-giving-up-on-an-encryption-truce-with-big-tech/5e54102688e0fa632ba828ea/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Cybersecurity 202” newsletter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that confirms that the Department of Justice is capitalizing on the techlash in order to build up congressional support for the DOJ’s long-desired goal of legislation that will restrict your freedom to encrypt your data and communications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;reports that, according to assistant attorney general for national security John Demers, the DOJ has given up hope that tech companies will “voluntarily” backdoor their own encryption, as the agency had been pressing them to do since around 2016. Instead, the DOJ is now “focusing on getting legislation that forces companies to cooperate – and is hoping encryption-limiting laws in Australia and the United Kingdom will ease the path for a similar law in the United States.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why now? What’s changed since 2016, when we had the great Apple vs. FBI showdown? According to Demers, two things: (1) the “techlash” by Congress and the public “in the wake of myriad privacy scandals” and the 2016 election; and (2)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/09/comments-assistance-access-act-australian-independent-national-security-legislation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Australia’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;2018 passage of the Assistance and Access Act, which followed on the heels of similar legislation in the United Kingdom in 2016. Demers “hopes these laws will create a model for how lawmakers in the United States might limit encryption.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These two factors lay out, straight from the horse’s mouth, what I’ve been saying for a while. It comes as something of a relief for a high-ranking DOJ official to finally acknowledge publicly the playbook I could see they were running to try to get Congress to finally ban strong encryption. That doesn’t mean I’m happy about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I explained&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;last month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the techlash has now gained enough momentum that law enforcement may have a fighting chance of getting its anti-encryption wish, under the guise of protecting children, in the form of a terrible bill called the EARN IT Act. That bill doesn’t look much like Australia’s Assistance and Access Act or the UK’s IP Act -- in fact it doesn’t mention the word “encryption” at all -- but right now it’s the lead contender for the DOJ to get an “encryption-limiting law” passed in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exploiting the techlash is a strategy I’ve been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2017/10/response-%E2%80%9Cresponsible-encryption%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;calling law enforcement out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for since October 2017. It’s incredibly frustrating for me to see that this obvious ploy is working so well. AAG Demers admitted that the DOJ thinks it can persuade congressmembers to be angry at tech companies over encryption because they’re already mad at those companies for violating users’ privacy. But this, let’s call it, transitive rage contradicts itself. Why? Because encryption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;protects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;user privacy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It doesn’t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;do that; indeed, information security experts have had to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/security_vs_pri.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;push back for years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;against the overly simplistic “security versus privacy” framing to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/security-debate-we-need-have&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;emphasize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the encryption debate is primarily a question of “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/protecting-republic-securing-communications-more-important-ever&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;security versus security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” Nevertheless, privacy certainly is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;one of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the main interests that encryption protects. And it doesn’t just shield your data and conversations from criminals and snoops: it can even shield them from the eyes of the entity that provided the encryption. For example, when you use a chat app such as WhatsApp that end-to-end encrypts your conversations by default,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;not even the app provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Facebook, in the case of WhatsApp) can read your messages or listen in on your calls. So, if you’re mad at Facebook for invading your privacy, you should be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;glad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that they use encryption that prevents them from snooping on your WhatsApp conversations, and that they’re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-whatsapp-instagram-chat-combined-encryption-identity/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;planning the same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for their other messaging services too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, the DOJ’s strategy is obviously just trying to sow confusion among the public and Congress by mixing up the issues: conflating tech companies’ privacy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;violations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with tech companies’ privacy-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;protective&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;encryption, as I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/703191/in-renewed-encryption-fight-the-techlash-cuts-both-ways&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pointed out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in a recent press article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Even Senator Graham, the author of the EARN IT Act bill, admitted in that very same article that this doesn’t make any sense: “When asked whether he saw any tension between Capitol Hill’s ongoing effort to pass privacy legislation and its burgeoning push to mandate encryption backdoors,” Graham admitted he saw “‘a lot.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, if even Senator Graham can see through the DOJ’s ploy to elicit what I’m calling transitive rage, why is it working? The answer might be: children. Per the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;today (and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/10/william-barr-and-winnie-pooh&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;me last fall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), “Justice officials have also shifted their messaging on encryption, talking less about the danger of terrorists recruiting and planning operations outside law enforcement's view and more about the threat of a surge in child predators sharing illicit images or luring children on social media.” Congress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/12/thoughts-senate-judiciary-committee%E2%80%99s-hearing-encryption&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;seems receptive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to this child-safety messaging. Legislators expect Big Tech to protect the privacy of users, including&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145698/google-student-privacy-lawsuit-education-schools-chromebooks-new-mexico-balderas&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Encryption shields users’ privacy. Simultaneously, they also expect Big Tech to be able to detect the bad guys on their services, including those who are hurting children. But encryption shields the bad guys too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to resolve this dilemma? Previously, the answer from Congress was “do nothing,” both on passing an anti-encryption law -- something for which Congress has heretofore shown no appetite -- and on passing comprehensive federal privacy legislation. But the tide has shifted, the Hill is awash in the techlash, and the DOJ has succeeded in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/11/banning-strong-encryption-does-not-mean-catching-criminals-it-only-makes-you-less-safe&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;equating being pro-encryption with being anti-child safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. If pedophiles benefit from strong encryption built in by default to popular software and devices, then, according to Senator Graham,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;nobody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;should get that benefit anymore. (Never mind that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/11/banning-strong-encryption-does-not-mean-catching-criminals-it-only-makes-you-less-safe&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;it won’t work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;out the way he thinks.) In a Congress already dithering over passing a federal privacy law, the child safety rationale may prevail, at the expense of the many interests that encryption protects -- privacy not least among them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe Graham, in acknowledging the dilemma of demanding both privacy and encryption backdoors simultaneously, was really just tacitly admitting that when 327 million Americans’ privacy is pitted against the rhetorical power of “think of the children,” privacy loses. Overall, the attitude from Congress in 2020 seems to be, to paraphrase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: “Protect users. Not too much. Mostly kids.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In October 2018, I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/riana-pfefferkorn-how-are-boundaries-digital-privacy-shifting&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;warned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the passage of the Australian law (then a pending bill) would likely have a domino effect on other Five Eyes countries, including the U.S. By passing the bill in December 2018, “Australia set an example of a Western democracy passing legislation that undermined encryption, making it look like that’s normal and OK,” I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/07/william-barr-despises-your-power-keep-him-snooping-you&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;last summer. It’s not OK, even if it becomes normal. Of the DOJ officials currently rejoicing over the opening Australia and the UK have given them to finally shove anti-encryption legislation through Congress, how many have ever said to their children, “And if all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The DOJ wants the U.S. to take a blinkered view of how governments should handle the topic of encryption. In July 2018, I had&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/07/comments-dojs-cyber-digital-task-force-report&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;predicted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the DOJ would place itself in an echo chamber where it would listen to “only other countries whose governments have adopted anti-encryption stances,” specifically Australia and the UK, while ignoring countries that have come out more strongly in favor of encryption, such as Germany. That seems to be what’s happening now: the DOJ wants America to imitate Australia, when Germany’s federal Office of Information Security just today issued&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/requirements/Requirements-Smartphones.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a set of proposed requirements for smartphones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;full-disk encryption. This shows that another way is possible than the path chosen by the UK and Australia. The German approach may have much to teach the U.S. It is dangerous for DOJ to urge Congress to stick its head in the sand and refuse to listen.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9a3220c3-7fff-c311-0b76-b3dc8e19f2a5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet here we are. With the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;disastrous EARN IT Act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;bill about to drop, the DOJ is openly and pointedly taking the gloves off in the encryption fight. But make no mistake: once the DOJ throws its knock-out punch, it’ll be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;privacy and security that hit the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Monopoly was invented to demonstrate the evils of capitalism (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the dual sets of rules, said Magie, was for players to experience a ‘practical demonstration of the present system of land grabbing with all its usual outcomes and consequences’ and hence to understand how different approaches to property ownership can lead to vastly different social outcomes. ‘It might well have been called “The Game of Life”,’ remarked Magie, ‘as it contains all the elements of success and failure in the real world, and the object is the same as the human race in general seems to have, ie, the accumulation of wealth.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was soon a hit among Left-wing intellectuals, on college campuses including the Wharton School, Harvard and Columbia, and also among Quaker communities, some of which modified the rules and redrew the board with street names from Atlantic City. Among the players of this Quaker adaptation was an unemployed man called Charles Darrow, who later sold such a modified version to the games company Parker Brothers as his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the game’s true origins came to light, Parker Brothers bought up Magie’s patent, but then re-launched the board game simply as Monopoly, and provided the eager public with just one set of rules: those that celebrate the triumph of one over all. Worse, they marketed it along with the claim that the game’s inventor was Darrow, who they said had dreamed it up in the 1930s, sold it to Parker Brothers, and become a millionaire. It was a rags-to-riches fabrication that ironically exemplified Monopoly’s implicit values: chase wealth and crush your opponents if you want to come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time someone invites you to join a game of Monopoly, here’s a thought. As you set out piles for the Chance and Community Chest cards, establish a third pile for Land-Value Tax, to which every property owner must contribute each time they charge rent to a fellow player. How high should that land tax be? And how should the resulting tax receipts be distributed? Such questions will no doubt lead to fiery debate around the Monopoly board – but then that is exactly what Magie had always hoped for.&lt;img src=&quot;https://metrics.aeon.co/count/daf1e6ff-4b0a-416b-8553-7e46573bb92e.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Raworth is a senior visiting research associate at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute and a senior associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://neutralino.js.org</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Neutralino is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node creates large overhead and makes even simple apps like “hello world” considerable in size. Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js also with many advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Chrome&amp;#039;s fear of Microsoft Edge is revealing its bad side</title>
<link>https://www.laptopmag.com/news/googles-fear-of-microsoft-edge-is-revealing-its-bad-side</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.laptopmag.com/news/googles-fear-of-microsoft-edge-is-revealing-its-bad-side</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Google is figuratively batting its eyelashes and puckering its lips in an attempt to seduce Microsoft Edge users to its industry-dominating Chrome browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of the new Chrominium-based Microsoft Edge are being aggressively targeted on popular Google platforms with messages urging Edge users to switch to Chrome, &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2020/02/24/google-chrome-microsoft-edge-switch-pop-up/&quot;&gt;9to5Google&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;hawk-widget&quot; data-render-type=&quot;fte&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;seasonal&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To use docs offline,&quot; Chrome wrote in its alluring message to Edge users, &quot;upgrade to Chrome.&quot; The pop-up, of course, is insinuating that Edge users won't be able to enjoy the full scope of Google Docs' features -- offline usage included -- by limiting themselves to Microsoft Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docs isn't the only platform Google is using to seduce Edge users into using Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google is also showing these 'Switch to Chrome' pop-ups to Microsoft Edge users on its Search homepage, News, and even on Google Translate. You can see some screenshots of these below,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laptopmag.com/news/Google%20is%20also%20showing%20these%20“Switch%20to%20Chrome”%20pop-ups%20to%20Microsoft%20Edge%20users%20on%20its%20Search%20homepage,%20News,%20and%20even%20on%20Google%20Translate.%20You%20can%20see%20some%20screenshots%20of%20these%20below.&quot;&gt;9to5Google&lt;/a&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google recommends using Chrome,&quot; Chrome warned Edge users using the Google search engine. &quot;Try a fast, secure browser with updates built in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned last week, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laptopmag.com/news/google-is-using-scare-tactics-to-get-people-to-use-chrome-instead-of-edge&quot;&gt;Chrome suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that their browser is fast and secure, it plants a seed in the mind of Edge users that their internet crawler is unsafe. That is despite there being no proof that the new Chrominum-based Edge browser is a security hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's peculiar about Chrome's messages is that, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://mspoweruser.com/google-is-pushing-chromium-edge-users-to-switch-to-chrome/&quot;&gt;MSPowerUser&lt;/a&gt; points out, Google seems to be solely targeting Edge users: &quot;We didn't receive any pop ups or warnings on Opera, which is also based on Chromium framework.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes us wonder if Chrome is sweating bullets about Edge potentially snatching a large share of its browser users. After all, in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laptopmag.com/news/hands-on-with-microsofts-new-edge-the-chrome-killer-is-here&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, we called the new browser &quot;the Chrome killer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have had a history of competing -- and playing a little dirty -- for each other's consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of Microsoft, for example, persuading users to choose Edge over Chrome on Windows 10. Perhaps Google, perpetuating this petty tug-of-war, is simply returning the favor.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Hearing Day 2</title>
<link>https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/02/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-2/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/02/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-2/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This afternoon Julian’s Spanish lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, left court to return to Madrid. On the way out he naturally stopped to shake hands with his client, proffering his fingers through the narrow slit in the bulletproof glass cage. Assange half stood to take his lawyer’s hand. The two security guards in the cage with Assange immediately sprang up, putting hands on Julian and forcing him to sit down, preventing the handshake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was not by any means the worst thing today, but it is a striking image of the senseless brute force continually used against a man accused of publishing documents. That a man cannot even shake his lawyer’s hand goodbye is against the entire spirit in which the members of the legal system like to pretend the law is practised. I offer that startling moment as encapsulating yesterday’s events in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 proceedings had started with a statement from Edward Fitzgerald, Assange’s QC, that shook us rudely into life. He stated that yesterday, on the first day of trial, Julian had twice been stripped naked and searched, eleven times been handcuffed, and five times been locked up in different holding cells. On top of this, all of his court documents had been taken from him by the prison authorities, including privileged communications between his lawyers and himself, and he had been left with no ability to prepare to participate in today’s proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Baraitser looked at Fitzgerald and stated, in a voice laced with disdain, that he had raised such matters before and she had always replied that she had no jurisdiction over the prison estate. He should take it up with the prison authorities. Fitzgerald remained on his feet, which drew a very definite scowl from Baraitser, and replied that of course they would do that again, but this repeated behaviour by the prison authorities threatened the ability of the defence to prepare. He added that regardless of jurisdiction, in his experience it was common practice for magistrates and judges to pass on comments and requests to the prison service where the conduct of the trial was affected, and that jails normally listened to magistrates sympathetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser flat-out denied any knowledge of such a practice, and stated that Fitzgerald should present her with written arguments setting out the case law on jurisdiction over prison conditions. This was too much even for prosecution counsel James Lewis, who stood up to say the prosecution would also want Assange to have a fair hearing, and that he could confirm that what the defence were suggesting was normal practice. Even then, Baraitser still refused to intervene with the prison. She stated that if the prison conditions were so bad as to reach the very high bar of making a fair hearing impossible, the defence should bring a motion to dismiss the charges on those grounds. Otherwise they should drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both prosecution and defence seemed surprised by Baraitser’s claim that she had not heard of what they both referred to as common practice. Lewis may have been genuinely concerned at the shocking description of Assange’s prison treatment yesterday; or he may have just had warning klaxons going off in his head screaming “mistrial”. But the net result is Baraitser will attempt to do nothing to prevent Julian’s physical and mental abuse in jail nor to try to give him the ability to participate in his defence. The only realistic explanation that occurs to me is that Baraitser has been warned off, because this continual mistreatment and confiscation of documents is on senior government authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last small incident for me to recount: having queued again from the early hours, I was at the final queue before the entrance to the public gallery, when the name was called out of Kristin Hrnafsson, editor of Wikileaks, with whom I was talking at the time. Kristin identified himself, and was told by the court official he was barred from the public gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I was with Kristin throughout the entire proceedings the previous day, and he had done absolutely nothing amiss – he is rather a quiet gentleman. When he was called for, it was by name and by job description – they were specifically banning the editor of Wikileaks from the trial. Kristin asked why and was told it was a decision of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage John Shipton, Julian’s father, announced that in this case the family members would all leave too, and they did so, walking out of the building. They and others then started tweeting the news of the family walkout. This appeared to cause some consternation among court officials, and fifteen minutes later Kristin was re-admitted. We still have no idea what lay behind this. Later in the day journalists were being briefed by officials it was simply over queue-jumping, but that seems improbable as he was removed by staff who called him by name and title, rather than had spotted him as a queue-jumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the above goes to the official matter of the case. All of the above tells you more about the draconian nature of the political show-trial which is taking place than does the charade being enacted in the body of the court. There were moments today when I got drawn in to the court process and achieved the suspension of disbelief you might do in theatre, and began thinking “Wow, this case is going well for Assange”. Then an event such as those recounted above kicks in, a coldness grips your heart, and you recall there is no jury here to be convinced. I simply do not believe that anything said or proved in the courtroom can have an impact on the final verdict of this court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to the actual proceedings in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the defence, Mark Summers QC stated that the USA charges were entirely dependent on three factual accusations of Assange behviour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Assange helped Manning to decode a hash key to access classified material.&lt;br/&gt;Summers stated this was a provably false allegation from the evidence of the Manning court-martial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Assange solicited the material from Manning&lt;br/&gt;Summers stated this was provably wrong from information available to the public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Assange knowingly put lives at risk&lt;br/&gt;Summers stated this was provably wrong both from publicly available information and from specific involvement of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Summers stated the US government knew that the allegations being made were false as to fact, and they were demonstrably made in bad faith. This was therefore an abuse of process which should lead to dismissal of the extradition request. He described the above three counts as “rubbish, rubbish and rubbish”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers then walked through the facts of the case. He said the charges from the USA divide the materials leaked by Manning to Wikileaks into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Diplomatic Cables&lt;br/&gt;b) Guantanamo detainee assessment briefs&lt;br/&gt;c) Iraq War rules of engagement&lt;br/&gt;d) Afghan and Iraqi war logs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers then methodically went through a), b), c) and d) relating each in turn to alleged behaviours 1), 2) and 3), making twelve counts of explanation and exposition in all. This comprehensive account took some four hours and I shall not attempt to capture it here. I will rather give highlights, but will relate occasionally to the alleged behaviour number and/or the alleged materials letter. I hope you follow that – it took me some time to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 1) Summers at great length demonstrated conclusively that Manning had access to each material a) b) c) d) provided to Wikileaks without needing any code from Assange, and had that access before ever contacting Assange. Nor had Manning needed a code to conceal her identity as the prosecution alleged – the database for intelligence analysts Manning could access – as could thousands of others – did not require a username or password to access it from a work military computer. Summers quoted testimony of several officers from Manning’s court-martial to confirm this. Nor would breaking the systems admin code on the system give Manning access to any additional classified databases. Summers quoted evidence from the Manning court-martial, where this had been accepted, that the reason Manning wanted to get in to systems admin was to allow soldiers to put their video-games and movies on their government laptops, which in fact happened frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Baraitser twice made major interruptions. She observed that if Chelsea Manning did not know she could not be traced as the user who downloaded the databases, she might have sought Assange’s assistance to crack a code to conceal her identity from ignorance she did not need to do that, and to assist would still be an offence by Assange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers pointed out that Manning knew that she did not need a username and password, because she actually accessed all the materials without one. Baraitser replied that this did not constitute proof she knew she could not be traced. Summers said in logic it made no sense to argue that she was seeking a code to conceal her user ID and password, where there was no user ID and password. Baraitser replied again he could not prove that. At this point Summers became somewhat testy and short with Baraitser, and took her through the court martial evidence again. Of which more…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser also made the point that even if Assange were helping Manning to crack an admin code, even if it did not enable Manning to access any more databases, that still was unauthorised use and would constitute the crime of aiding and abetting computer misuse, even if for an innocent purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief break, Baraitser came back with a real zinger. She told Summers that he had presented the findings of the US court martial of Chelsea Manning as fact. But she did not agree that her court had to treat evidence at a US court martial, even agreed or uncontested evidence or prosecution evidence, as fact. Summers replied that agreed evidence or prosecution evidence at the US court martial clearly was agreed by the US government as fact, and what was at issue at the moment was whether the US government was charging contrary to the facts it knew. Baraitser said she would return to her point once witnesses were heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser was no making no attempt to conceal a hostility to the defence argument, and seemed irritated they had the temerity to make it. This burst out when discussing c), the Iraq war rules of engagement. Summers argued that these had not been solicited from Manning, but had rather been provided by Manning in an accompanying file along with the Collateral Murder video that showed the murder of Reuters journalists and children. Manning’s purpose, as she stated at her court martial, was to show that the Collateral Murder actions breached the rules of engagement, even though the Department of Defense claimed otherwise. Summers stated that by not including this context, the US extradition request was deliberately misleading as it did not even mention the Collateral Murder video at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Baraitser could not conceal her contempt. Try to imagine Lady Bracknell saying “A Handbag” or “the Brighton line”, or if your education didn’t run that way try to imagine Pritti Patel spotting a disabled immigrant. This is a literal quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you suggesting, Mr Summers, that the authorities, the Government, should have to provide context for its charges?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unfazed Summers replied in the affirmative and then went on to show where the Supreme Court had said so in other extradition cases. Baraitser was showing utter confusion that anybody could claim a significant distinction between the Government and God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Summers’ argument went to refuting behaviour 3), putting lives at risk. This was only claimed in relation to materials a) and d). Summers described at great length the efforts of Wikileaks with media partners over more than a year to set up a massive redaction campaign on the cables. He explained that the unredacted cables only became available after Luke Harding and David Leigh of the Guardian published the password to the cache as the heading to Chapter XI of their book &lt;strong&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/strong&gt;, published in February 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody had put 2 and 2 together on this password until the German publication Die Freitag had done so and announced it had the unredacted cables in August 2011. Summers then gave the most powerful arguments of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US government had been actively participating in the redaction exercise on the cables. They therefore knew the allegations of reckless publication to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Die Freitag announced they had the unredacted materials, Julian Assange and Sara Harrison instantly telephoned the White House, State Department and US Embassy to warn them named sources may be put at risk. Summers read from the transcripts of telephone conversations as Assange and Harrison attempted to convince US officials of the urgency of enabling source protection procedures – and expressed their bafflement as officials stonewalled them. This evidence utterly undermined the US government’s case and proved bad faith in omitting extremely relevant fact. It was a very striking moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With relation to the same behaviour 3) on materials d), Summers showed that the Manning court martial had accepted these materials contained no endangered source names, but showed that Wikileaks had activated a redaction exercise anyway as a “belt and braces” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was much more from the defence. For the prosecution, James Lewis indicated he would reply in depth later in proceedings, but wished to state that the prosecution does not accept the court martial evidence as fact, and particularly does not accept any of the “self-serving” testimony of Chelsea Manning, whom he portrayed as a convicted criminal falsely claiming noble motives. The prosecution generally rejected any notion that this court should consider the truth or otherwise of any of the facts; those could only be decided at trial in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to wrap up proceedings, Baraitser dropped a massive bombshell. She stated that although Article 4.1 of the US/UK Extradition Treaty forbade political extraditions, this was only in the Treaty. That exemption does not appear in the UK Extradition Act. On the face of it therefore political extradition is not illegal in the UK, as the Treaty has no legal force on the Court. She invited the defence to address this argument in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now 06.35am and I am late to start queuing…&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Your Man in the Public Gallery - Assange Hearing Day 2 - Craig Murray</og:title>
<og:description>This afternoon Julian’s Spanish lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, left court to return to Madrid. On the way out he naturally stopped to shake hands with his client, proffering his fingers through the narrow slit in the bulletproof glass cage. Assange half stood to take his lawyer’s hand. The two security guards in the cage with Assange …</og:description>

I am so proud of our staff for making this discovery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brass plaque, erected in Westminster Hall in 1895, marks the spot where the doorway once was but, says Dr Hallam Smith, &quot;almost nothing was known about it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lay behind thick masonry, on the hall side, and wooden panelling, running the full length of a Tudor cloister, on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until three years ago, the cloister had been used as offices by the Labour Party, and before that, a cloakroom for MPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    The west Cloister where the door to the chamber was discovered
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Dr Hallam Smith who discovered evidence of a small, secret access door that had been set into the cloister's panelling, during Parliament's last major renovation in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were trawling through 10,000 uncatalogued documents relating to the palace at the Historic England Archives in Swindon, when we found plans for the doorway in the cloister behind Westminster Hall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we looked at the panelling closely, we realised there was a tiny brass key-hole that no-one had really noticed before, believing it might just be an electricity cupboard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team turned to Parliament's locksmith for help and, with some difficulty, he was able to open the wood panel door, to reveal a tiny, stone-floored chamber, with a bricked-up doorway on the far wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered the original hinges for two wooden doors 3.5m high, that would have opened into Westminster Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found graffiti dating back to the rebuilding of Parliament, in a neo-Gothic style, following the fire in 1834 which destroyed much of the medieval palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scrawled pencil marks, left by men who helped block the passageway on both sides in 1851, read: &quot;This room was enclosed by Tom Porter who was very fond of Ould Ale.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Pencil graffiti dating back to the 1850s is still visible
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then names the witnesses of &quot;the articles of the wall&quot; - evidently architect Sir Charles Barry's masons who had joined bricklayer's labourer Thomas Porter in a toast to mark the room's enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men can be traced in the 1851 census returns as Richard Condon, James Williams, Henry Terry, Thomas Parker and Peter Dewal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally the graffiti notes: &quot;These masons were employed refacing these groines...[ie repairing the cloister] August 11th 1851 Real Democrats.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reference to &quot;real democrats&quot; suggests the group were part of the Chartist movement, which campaigned for every man aged 21 to have a vote, and for would-be MPs to be allowed to stand even if they did not own property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Charles Barry's masons were quite subversive,&quot; said Dr Hallam Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They had been involved in quite a few scraps as the Palace was being built. I think these ones were being a little bit bolshie but also highly celebratory because they had just finished the first major restoration of these beautiful Tudor cloisters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A light switch - probably installed in the 1950s - illuminated a large Osram bulb marked 'HM Government Property'. The team is eager to learn more about the history of this hardy bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Collins said further investigations made him certain the doorway dated back at least 360 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    The plaque in Westminster Hall may not be entirely accurate, the team believes
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dendrochronology testing revealed that the ceiling timbers above the little room dated from trees felled in 1659 - which tied in with surviving accounts that stated the doorway was made in 1660-61 for the coronation banquet of Charles II. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to the words on the brass plaque in Westminster Hall, which state the passageway was used in 1642 by Charles I, when he attempted to arrest five MPs, which the researchers believe is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Collins said the plans that led to their discovery will now be digitised as part of Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The mystery of the secret doorway is one we have enjoyed discovering - but the palace no doubt still has many more secrets to give up,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We hope to share the story with visitors to the palace when the building is finally restored to its former glory, so it can be passed on down the generations and is never forgotten again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;postmeta&quot;&gt;Published February 24, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://evanm.website/images/energy-startup-lessons/glacier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, I’ve worked at two startups in what is now being called the climate tech sector&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;fn1ref&quot; href=&quot;https://evanm.website/2020/02/five-years-in-energy/#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Given the recent surge in interest in this space, I thought it would be worthwhile to record a handful of lessons that I’ve learned from this experience. These lessons span business strategy and the realities of the electric utility industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;timeline-what-has-this-guy-actually-done&quot;&gt;Timeline: What has this guy actually done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Twitter in early 2015 with the goal of finding software opportunities in grid modernization&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;fn2ref&quot; href=&quot;https://evanm.website/2020/02/five-years-in-energy/#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon thereafter, I met a couple guys who were leaving &lt;acronym title=&quot;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&quot;&gt;LBNL&lt;/acronym&gt; to start a company around &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/931c/9a2e7a5843ed077e8564455b551aff74a655.pdf&quot;&gt;a novel sensing technique&lt;/a&gt; for monitoring home energy use. I joined them as the first employee of Whisker Labs, where we set about making it cheaper and easier to mine residential energy data. After a handful of successful pilots and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/05/earth-networks-acquires-whisker-labs-and-launches-diy-home-energy-monitor/&quot;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, I parted ways with Whisker Labs in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then spent some time developing an idea to address painpoints I’d observed while working with electric utilities at Whisker Labs. I ended up joining an early-stage team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.company&quot;&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; that shared my thinking on this specific problem space. I can’t say much of anything about this project, due to the secretive nature of X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following unordered and subjective list reflects my thinking about startups in the energy space, particularly those that aim to sell software to utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-consumers-dont-care-about-energy&quot;&gt;1. Consumers don’t care about energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal energy system is one that fades into the background. The overwhelming majority of people don’t ever want to think about how electricity is delivered to their homes or how much of it they’re using. No one actually wants to look at time series plots of energy usage. They just want the lights to turn on when they flip a switch or yell at Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early adopter types might enjoy seeing in real time how much power their solar panels are generating or their car is drawing, but this is not functionality that will drive user engagement or revenue at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-exits-are-different-than-those-for-traditional-tech-startups&quot;&gt;2. Exits are different than those for traditional tech startups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be blunt—you’re probably not going to sell your climate tech startup to Facebook. In the event you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get acquired, a statistically likely buyer is an oil major like Exxon Mobil, an industrial giant like Siemens, or a European utility like E.ON, Enel, or ENGIE. These companies aren’t going to pay $10 MM per employee or cater to your taste in programming languages or productivity software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that energy startups can’t have exits that make money for founders and investors. But the scale of these exits and the character of acquiring companies is typically not what you see for software startups in other venture-fueled verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-you-live-or-die-by-the-trust-you-build-in-the-industry&quot;&gt;3. You live or die by the trust you build in the industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is the ultimate example of an industry where “build it and they will come” doesn’t work. For utilities, downtime is often measured in fatalities and switching costs are massive. There is huge institutional inertia impeding the adoption of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming this inertia takes a long time and requires that your team include deep subject matter experts who can speak the language of the industry. As in any other enterprise setting, you need to build real relationships with stakeholders up and down your target customer’s org chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And realize that the people who write checks are typically not the people who will use your software. As a consequence, the quality or state-of-the-artness of your technology often won’t be a primary contributor to your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-energy-economics-are-a-poor-match-for-venture-capital&quot;&gt;4. Energy economics are a poor match for venture capital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, energy is a commodity good. This translates to razor-thin margins for companies whose primary product is electricity or natural gas. If your business involves selling to these companies, then you inherit their commodity-driven nature, making it very difficult to achieve returns that are attractive to investors used to SaaS companies with 80% margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way many successful companies avoid this problem is by changing the nature of the product they offer. By framing your business around something other than energy/savings (e.g. comfort, convenience, automation, luxury), you can escape the razer-thin margin game. Your overarching mission can still be to save energy or reduce emissions, but as a by-product of a valuable service that customers will pay real money for. In consumer settings, this approach can also help work around the fact that most consumers don’t care about energy (discussed above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-beware-the-utility-sales-cycle&quot;&gt;5. Beware the utility sales cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glacial pace of the utility sales cycle has a big impact on cash management and fundraising for startups. Companies aiming to sell to utilities need to be extra mindful of runway and plan far in advance the traction metrics they can realistically raise money on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilities are some of the most-regulated and slowest-moving companies in existence. They plan budgets in multi-year increments and introduce new technologies over the course of decades. Staying alive as a utility vendor or service provider requires minimizing your company’s burn rate and scraping together enough early pilot projects to show traction to the next round’s investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, say you start a company with money from friends and family to build a product that will help utilities decarbonize the residential sector. In order to raise money in 9–12 months, institutional investors will expect to see one or two signed pilot agreements and demonstrated progress towards the milestones of these pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you send emails, get on the phone, and rack up airline miles to sell the stuffing out of your idea. You convince a decision-maker at a utility across the country that your product is the perfect fit for a demonstration project they’ve been planning for months. This person introduces you to an executive with “Innovation” in their title and helps you develop a case for why your product is exactly what they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later, you’ve made it through an &lt;acronym title=&quot;Request For Proposals&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/acronym&gt; process and landed a $5 MM pilot. The pilot is split into three phases over the course of the next five years, with most of the money coming in the last phase. $500k lands in your bank account for phase zero, which only extends your runway three months once you factor in the people you’ll need to hire. Seven months has passed since your friends-and-family round and you’re losing sleep over the number of parenthesized numbers in your financial spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;An aside on funding—grants (for instance, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbir.gov/&quot;&gt;the Small Business Innovation Research program&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grants.gov/learn-grants/grant-making-agencies/department-of-energy.html&quot;&gt;Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;) can be an alternative source of early stage funding that is better suited to many energy projects than traditional VC. They provide patient capital and, in many cases, don’t take an equity stake. Grants can help get an R&amp;amp;D project off the ground without having to jump on the VC treadmill right out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But grants do have downsides. You lock yourself into arbitrary demonstration milestones that tend to quickly diverge from where market opportunities lie. Customer development should always come first, and you run the risk of getting sidetracked with the care and feeding of grant milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-policy-is-more-important-than-technology&quot;&gt;6. Policy is more important than technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as bending the warming curve towards 1.5° C is concerned, I think policy and regulatory reform is currently a larger source of leverage than technology. In particular, carbon pricing (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/the-fastest-way-to-cut-carbon-emissions-is-a-fee-and-a-rebate-top-leaders-say/2020/02/13/b63b766c-4cfc-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html&quot;&gt;if done right&lt;/a&gt;) is the single most effective tool we have to reduce global emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong—technology innovation is obviously a primary means to addressing climate change. But I feel more and more that we’re approaching the point at which technology has gone about as far as it can within the confines of a 20th century policy regime. Buying EVs and solar panels make us feel good, but only represents marginal progress while oil subsidies artificially prop up the internal combustion engine and campaign finance laws give incumbent fossil fuel companies undue influence to hamstring the deployment of clean technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within an antagonistic policy framework, solar, wind, and batteries are proving to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many geographies. Imagine how far they’ll go once the rules actually incentivize them at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that we’ll get where we need to go without a global price on carbon. This is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://evanm.website/2019/03/my-climate-lobby-hobby/&quot;&gt;I volunteer with the Citizens’ Climate Lobby&lt;/a&gt; to build political will for a national carbon fee and dividend policy in the US. It seems insurmountable given the current political climate, but you’d be surprised how much progress we’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-words-of-encouragement&quot;&gt;Closing words of encouragement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure this essay has made clear, five years of building technologies for sale to utilities has left me rather burnt out by the slow pace and legacy nature of the energy industry. That being said, I remain excited by the incredible work being done throughout the energy/climate startup ecosystem. I don’t mean to dissuade anyone from taking the plunge, but founding teams need to know what they’re signing up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And investors need to know what they’re funding. Energy is not the realm of hyper-growth SaaS apps that can scale to 10 million users in the blink of an eye. A utility might only have 20 people in their organization that will meaningfully use a specialized product. And it could take three years of sales and integration legwork to get a product paid for and incorporated into day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take these lessons with a grain of salt. If you’re setting out on a startup journey in the energy sector, your mileage will undoubtedly vary. I’m rooting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
