<title>Is Stupidity Expanding? Some Hypotheses</title>
<link>https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BHqzGLNyQHjDXhEc8/is-stupidity-expanding-some-hypotheses</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BHqzGLNyQHjDXhEc8/is-stupidity-expanding-some-hypotheses</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;To be ex­plained: &lt;strong&gt;It feels to me that in re­cent years, peo­ple have got­ten stupi­der, or that stupid has got­ten big­ger, or that the parts of peo­ple that were always stupid have got­ten louder, or some­thing like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come up with a suite of hy­pothe­ses to ex­plain this (with a lit­tle help from my friends). I thought I’d throw them out here to see which ones the wise crowd here think are most likely. Bonus points if you come up with some new ones. Gold stars if you can rule some out based on ex­ist­ing data or can pro­pose tests by which they might be ren­dered more or less plau­si­ble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hy­pothe­ses come in two broad fam­i­lies: 1) my feel­ing that stupid is ex­pand­ing is an illu­sion or mis­per­cep­tion, and 2) stupid is ex­pand­ing and here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol readability=&quot;35.316170957261&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1.6588235294118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have be­come more at­tuned to stu­pidity for [rea­sons], so even though there is no more of it than usual, it stands out more to me. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion&quot;&gt;Baader-Mein­hof phe­nomenon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What used to look like non-stu­pidity was ac­tu­ally wide­spread con­for­mity to a com­mon menu of fool­ish­nesses. To­day the cul­tural bea­cons of re­spectable idiocy have been over­thrown and there is in­creas­ing di­ver­sity in fool­ish­ness. Diver­gent fools seem more fool­ish to each other when in fact we’re all just as stupid as we’ve always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m run­ning in stupi­der cir­cles than I used to for some rea­son, while in gen­eral things haven’t changed much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.6794425087108&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the one get­ting stupi­der, or was stupid all along, and so I don’t have the cog­ni­tive strength to ac­cu­rately judge the stu­pidity level around me, and just hap­pen to be think­ing it is get­ting worse be­cause I don’t know any bet­ter. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dun­ning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple aren’t get­ting any stupi­der, it’s just that the ar­tifi­cial in­tel­li­gence of the bots I’m mis­tak­ing for peo­ple on-line isn’t all that good yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not get­ting stupi­der; I’m just get­ting more con­ceited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple or­di­nar­ily use differ­ent modes of think­ing in differ­ent com­mu­ni­ca­tions con­texts. In some, find­ing the truth is im­por­tant and so they use ra­tio­nal in­tel­li­gence. In oth­ers, dec­o­ra­tive dis­play, rit­ual, as­sert­ing dom­i­nance or sub­mis­sion, dis­play­ing tribal alle­giances, etc. are more im­por­tant and so they use modes more ap­pro­pri­ate to those things. It’s not that peo­ple are get­ting stupi­der, but that these non-in­tel­li­gent forms of com­mu­ni­ca­tion (a) are more am­plified than they used to be, (b) more com­monly prac­ticed than they used to be, or (c) are more promi­nent where I hap­pen to be train­ing my at­ten­tion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ac­quiring greater wis­dom with age as I ought, but the av­er­age age of the typ­i­cal per­son I en­counter stays the same so they can­not keep up. I’m notic­ing the con­trast in­creas­ing but mis­at­tribut­ing it. (David Wood­er­son effect)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple use in­tel­li­gence for differ­ent things in differ­ent eras. Just as lan­guage, mu­sic, art changes over time, so does think­ing. I’m just not keep­ing up, and as­sum­ing be­cause kids these days can’t dance the men­tal Charleston that they can’t dance at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.78378378378378&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were just as stupid back in the day, and I just don’t re­mem­ber it that way. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection&quot;&gt;Rosy ret­ro­spec­tion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no truth, only power. What I’ve been in­ter­pret­ing as truth and ra­tio­nal­ity has been my own at­tempt to al­ign my think­ing with the poli­ti­cal clique that was in power when I was be­ing ed­u­cated. What I’m in­ter­pret­ing as ris­ing stu­pidity has been the col­lapse in power and sta­tus of that clique and the poli­ti­cal ob­so­les­cence of the va­ri­ety of “truth” and “ra­tio­nal­ity” I in­ter­nal­ized as a child. Those pomo philoso­phers were right all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stu­pidity doesn’t have stay­ing power, rel­a­tive to non-stu­pidity: there’s a sort of sur­vival of the fittest in which vast amounts of ex­pres­sions are be­ing pro­duced all the time, most of which are stupid and fall away, but the ones that aren’t stupid are more likely to sur­vive in mem­ory and to be main­tained in the his­tor­i­cal record. This bi­ases things to make it ap­pear that the pro­por­tion of non-stupid ex­pres­sions was lower in the past than it re­ally was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poli­tics and con­sumer cap­i­tal­ism are mo­ti­vated to iden­tify and tar­get stupid peo­ple so as to take ad­van­tage of them, so they have cre­ated sys­tems that en­courage stupid peo­ple to self-iden­tify and make them­selves promi­nent so that they can be picked off; that I’m notic­ing this is just a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple have given up try­ing to un­der­stand things in this messed-up timeline and are just rol­ling with it; it’s a sort of in­tel­lec­tual learned hel­pless­ness that ap­pears as ex­pand­ing stu­pidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stu­pidity has its fash­ions, and the lat­est fash­ions are more in-your-face than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals that have be­come pop­u­lar in re­cent decades have cog­ni­tive side effects that are difficult to mea­sure in the in­di­vi­d­ual but cause no­tice­able effects in the ag­gre­gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly some­thing in our diet, for ex­am­ple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly all that ex­tra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the at­mo­sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly tox­o­plas­mo­sis meow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly some other sort of change in our ma­te­rial en­vi­ron­ment (ex­clud­ing cul­tural changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, when a per­son had a stupid idea, they would be re­luc­tant to put it for­ward as their own. Rather, they would wait to see if some­one else would voice the idea so they could just agree with it. This used to be rel­a­tively rare, but now you just have to google “[my stupid idea]” to find that some­one or other has said it first, and then you’re off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a smart idea, you may also be smart enough to re­al­ize that it’s not use­ful right now /​ has already been bet­ter said /​ is in­ap­pro­pri­ate in con­text. If you have a dumb idea, such thoughts may be less likely to oc­cur to you due to the aura of dumbth that sur­rounds the dumb idea and re­pels sen­si­ble con­sid­er­a­tions. Back when ex­pres­sions of stu­pidity were mostly ephemeral, this didn’t mat­ter much, but now that they ac­quire in­stant per­ma­nence and global reach, they ap­pear to swamp ev­ery­thing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid choices used to re­li­ably have un­de­sir­able re­sults; now there is more of a dis­con­nect where peo­ple are shielded from the re­sults of their stupid choices, or even re­warded for them (man lights him­self on fire in an eas­ily-forsee­able mis­ad­ven­ture, be­comes YouTube leg­end). So peo­ple may be ap­pear­ing stupid not as a re­sult of be­ing stupid but as the re­sult of a per­verse cost-benefit anal­y­sis. Peo­ple are no dumber than they used to be, but for [rea­sons] it has be­come ad­van­ta­geous to dis­play stu­pidity and so smart peo­ple some­times mimic idiocy so as to reap such ad­van­tages. The smarter they are, the quicker they caught on to this and the bet­ter mimics they are, so this makes it look as though the smart peo­ple are be­ing re­placed by mo­rons, when re­ally it’s more a mat­ter of cam­ou­flage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we ed­u­cate chil­dren went se­ri­ously side­ways a while back, and so, yeah, stupid hap­pened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly-pop­u­lar me­dia and/​or its con­tent is some­how di­rectly dam­ag­ing to men­tal fac­ul­ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in me­dia/​com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy al­low stupid peo­ple to be much more promi­nent than they used to be and/​or com­par­a­tively muffle smarter peo­ple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So­cial me­dia dy­nam­ics erode rea­son­ing and truth-seek­ing while re­ward­ing cog­ni­tive bi­ases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news me­dia were do­ing a bet­ter job than we re­al­ized in fil­ter­ing out crap and con­tex­tu­al­iz­ing new in­for­ma­tion in­tel­li­gently for us, and as the in­ter­net de­stroyed the busi­ness model be­hind in­tel­li­gent re­port­ing, we failed to come up with a sub­sti­tute in time to pre­vent idiocy from filling the void and it’s too big a job for in­di­vi­d­u­als to do with­out in­sti­tu­tional as­sis­tance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;18/ Once, in the middle of 2017, our VP of Product pulled me aside and said, “hey, you look really stressed out—is everything OK?” It was such a kind, generous and supportive gesture. I could have, and should have, been open with her. I wasn't. She left 6 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Waypoint: Build, deploy, and release applications across any platform</title>
<link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;56.74931880109&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we are happy to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/&quot; title=&quot;HashiCorp Waypoint&quot;&gt;HashiCorp Waypoint&lt;/a&gt;, a new open source project that provides developers a consistent workflow to build, deploy, and release applications across any platform.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Waypoint enables developers to get their applications from development to production in a single file and deploy using a single command: &lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out of the box, Waypoint supports Kubernetes, HashiCorp Nomad, Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances, Docker, Buildpacks, and more. Waypoint is fully extensible and is based on a plugin system which allows Waypoint to work with any tool or platform. After deployment, Waypoint provides features such as logs, exec, and more to validate and debug any deployments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waypoint is software you download and self-host to manage the deployment of applications that run on your own infrastructure or platforms. Waypoint does not require any HashiCorp-provided services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download and try Waypoint now from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/&quot; title=&quot;Waypoint Project website&quot;&gt;Waypoint project website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Continue reading to learn more about what Waypoint is, the problems it solves, the features it has, and an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=250 250w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=500 500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=750 750w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1000 1000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1500 1500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2000 2000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704453-waypoint-up.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2500 2500w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; alt=&quot;waypoint up workflow&quot; data-testid=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;72&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Addressing Deployment Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built Waypoint for one simple reason: developers just want to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At HashiCorp, we have the opportunity to work with all types of organizations and individuals in our community, exposing us to a range of challenges facing developers in getting applications deployed and available to users. We talk with dozens of individual users every day through GitHub Issues, discussion forums, email, etc. We meet with over 500 companies every single week to discuss their ongoing development and operational challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these interactions, we saw a pattern of developers (especially in medium-sized and larger organizations) being inundated with complexity: containers, schedulers, YAML files, serverless, and more. This complexity has improved the capability of our applications in many ways, but the cost can be seen in the learning curve required to just get your first application deployed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge we saw is that depending on where you want to deploy your application, the tool you use is often different — Docker and kubectl for Kubernetes, HashiCorp Packer and Terraform for VMs, custom CLIs for each serverless platform, etc. For the individual, this fragmentation again poses a learning curve challenge. For teams, it’s a challenge in consistency and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Waypoint, we aim to solve these two challenges. Waypoint provides one easy-to-use command to get any application deployed: &lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt;. This workflow is consistent across any platform, including Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, Google Cloud Run, and over a dozen more at launch. Waypoint can be extended with plugins to target any build/deploy/release logic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers just want to deploy. Waypoint gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;26.912228796844&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoint provides a range of features that provide a workflow for deploying your applications as well as validating and debugging deployments. These features make Waypoint a powerful deployment tool for any application on any platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; A single command that builds, deploys, and releases your application. Waypoint uses a configuration file, stored with your app’s code, to define how this works. We go into more detail about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/lifecycle&quot; title=&quot;Waypoint app lifecycle&quot;&gt;Waypoint app lifecycle&lt;/a&gt; in the Waypoint documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Per-App and Per-Deployment URLs:&lt;/strong&gt; Applications deployed with Waypoint receive a public &lt;code&gt;waypoint.run&lt;/code&gt; URL with a valid TLS certificate automatically generated via &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot; title=&quot;Let's Encrypt&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. Use this URL to quickly view your deployed applications and share your applications with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exec:&lt;/strong&gt; You can execute commands in the context of a deployed application using &lt;code&gt;waypoint exec&lt;/code&gt;. You can use exec to open up a shell in your app, which you can use for debugging, executing database migrations, and many other purposes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://waypointproject.io/docs/exec&quot; title=&quot;Waypoint exec&quot;&gt;Learn more about waypoint exec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logs:&lt;/strong&gt; Waypoint gives you access to a real-time snapshot of your application’s logs. These logs are helpful when you need to debug emergent application behavior. They do not, however, replace comprehensive logging solutions like Datadog or Splunk. Waypoint app logs are aggregated and available to view via the CLI and the web-based UI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://waypointproject.io/docs/logs&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about Waypoint logs&quot;&gt;Learn more about logs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web UI:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to a simple and powerful command-line interface, Waypoint also includes a web-based user interface that allows you to view builds, deployments, and releases for projects and applications. The UI is read-only today and we will be continuously developing it to support more functionality in the future. We have also included tips within the UI on how to complete Waypoint workflows in the CLI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugins:&lt;/strong&gt; The build, deploy, and release logic is fully extensible using plugins. Waypoint ships with over a dozen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/plugins&quot; title=&quot;Waypoint built-in plugins&quot;&gt;built-in plugins&lt;/a&gt;, and anyone is welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/extending-waypoint&quot; title=&quot;Extend Waypoint by writing a plugin&quot;&gt;extend Waypoint by writing their own plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use an example to showcase the various features of Waypoint. This skips some setup steps, so if you'd like to try a full example on your own, please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started&quot; title=&quot;Waypoint Getting Started guides&quot;&gt;Getting Started guides&lt;/a&gt;. For this example, we'll deploy an application to Kubernetes. Alongside our app, we'll create a &lt;code&gt;waypoint.hcl&lt;/code&gt; file. This file describes how to build, deploy, and release our application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;CodeBlock_codeBlockContainer__3UXdt&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;project = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;HashiCorp Waypoint&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;app &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;waypoint-up&quot;&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;g-code-block&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;62&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build, Deploy, Release&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Waypoint configuration file describes three main stages of the application lifecycle: build, deploy, and release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The build stage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;takes application source code and converts it to an artifact. The build process may also include an optional registry configuration to push the built artifact to a registry so that it is available for the deployment platform. For example, this stage converts your source to a Docker  image, an EC2 AMI, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deploy stage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;takes a previously built artifact and stages it onto the target deployment platform and is available via deployment URLs or other internal means. Waypoint supports Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, ECS, Google Cloud Run, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The release stage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;activates a previously staged deployment and opens it to general traffic. We will be adding support to the project in the future for promoting applications between environments, rolling back deployments and releases, and for progressively moving traffic between servers following a release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt; command runs the entire build, deploy, and release stages to deploy the application. At the end, it outputs one or more URLs you can use to access your application. No matter what application you're deploying or to what platform, you always use &lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt; to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;App and Deployment URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Applications deployed with Waypoint will receive a public &lt;code&gt;waypoint.run&lt;/code&gt; URL with a valid TLS certificate automatically generated via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Use this URL to quickly view your deployed applications and share your applications with others. We provide this URL via a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp. This feature is optional and can be disabled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the example above, the URL is &lt;code&gt;https://recently-pleasant-duck--v1.waypoint.run&lt;/code&gt;. (Note that this URL will not work anymore since we only kept the app running while we were authoring this blog post.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can also browse to specific deployment versions using the syntax &lt;code&gt;https://recently-pleasant-duck--vN.waypoint.run&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; is the deployment version number. This is a very useful feature to share pre-release versions of your application with team members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waypoint gives you access to a real-time snapshot of your application’s logs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These logs are helpful when you need to debug emergent application behavior. They do not, however, replace comprehensive logging solutions. Waypoint app logs are aggregated and available to view via the CLI and the web-based UI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This log feature works no matter what platform you're using. Whether you're on Kubernetes, EC2, Google Cloud Run, or any other platform, you can view your logs in a consistent way. Using the UI, you can view logs across multiple applications that may be deployed to different platforms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=250 250w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=500 500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=750 750w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1000 1000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1500 1500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2000 2000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602709441-3-ui-screen.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2500 2500w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; alt=&quot;Waypoint Web UI&quot; data-testid=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint Exec&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can execute commands in the context of a deployed application using &lt;code&gt;waypoint exec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This feature lets you open a shell, run scripts, or do anything else you'd like to do to your deployments. Just like logs, this feature works across all platforms supported by Waypoint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=250 250w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=500 500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=750 750w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1000 1000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1500 1500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2000 2000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1602704607-2-wp-exec.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=2500 2500w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; alt=&quot;waypoint exec command&quot; data-testid=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;LongformContentSection_longformContentSection__1LH1A g-type-body&quot; readability=&quot;85.52021187622&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Even More Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This list is just a glimpse of some of the features Waypoint supports. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waypoint can be used to manage application configuration through environment variables, you can integrate Waypoint with your CI or GitHub, you can use workspaces to create branch-specific environments, you can write your own plugins, and more. Additionally, Waypoint is a brand new project. We expect to continue to add more features to Waypoint over the coming months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waypoint with Existing Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have existing apps and a deployment workflow, you might feel uncertain that you can easily make use of Waypoint. We do not expect that teams are immediately going to rebuild their existing workflows from scratch using Waypoint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, we have plugins such as &quot;docker-pull&quot; and a local execution mode that enable you to adopt Waypoint into applications that have previously defined workflows. Additionally, we have documentation that describes how to integrate Waypoint into CI systems such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/automating-execution/circle-ci&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CircleCI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/automating-execution/jenkins&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jenkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This feature lets you get your application deployment history into the Waypoint UI and can enable exec, logs, configuration, and more for your app. With a small amount of effort, you get the immediate benefit of using Waypoint while you consider whether you'd like to move to a more managed plugin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, if you have multiple applications, this approach lets you mix and match: some applications with predefined deployment logic may use the &quot;exec&quot; plugin, while newer applications might opt to using a buildpack-based approach. Either way, &lt;code&gt;waypoint up&lt;/code&gt; gets your applications to production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fully Extensible via Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The build, deploy, and release logic is fully extensible using plugins. Waypoint is built on the same plugin system as Terraform, and we believe it is just as easy, if not easier, to write plugins for Waypoint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waypoint ships with over a dozen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/plugins&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;built-in plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to start, and we hope and expect that over time, with the help of the open source community, this number will grow dramatically. When we first released Terraform, we shipped around 6 providers. Today, there are over 300 Terraform providers. We believe Waypoint has the opportunity to do the same for application deployment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you're interested in writing plugins, please read our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/extending-waypoint&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;plugin authoring guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and take a look at the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/builtin&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;source for the plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that are built-in to the Waypoint 0.1 release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A warning about Glassdoor</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: A little info from Glassdoor that I learned as part of my last job in marketing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The most recent review left, regardless of its score, is weighted at 80%. This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Original&lt;/strong&gt;: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seekers overall job-seeking toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;About a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;I have a very close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a strategic repositioning, if you will, for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, all of the similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, &quot;great culture&quot;, &quot;build your skills&quot;, &quot;enlightened management&quot;, &quot;cool tech&quot;, &quot;takes care of employees&quot;. I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their &quot;proprietary algorithm&quot; to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter and Facebook&amp;#039;s action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing,&quot; said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Congress should invest in open-source software</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;5536&quot; height=&quot;4160&quot; src=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Unsplash_Nagle_FOSS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1066724&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;12.426470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to past crises, investments in physical infrastructure have helped the United States recover and thrive after significant challenges. After both the Great Depression and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/02/22/eight-years-later-what-the-recovery-act-taught-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Great Recession&lt;/a&gt;, for example, increased investment in transportation infrastructure was a key part of bringing the American economy back from disaster.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant economic crisis requires a similarly significant response, but it also asks of lawmakers to consider what is next. We can’t just invest in highways—we also need to invest in the technology underpinning the information superhighway. To rebuild from one of the greatest challenges of our time, the United States must invest both in physical and digital infrastructure to secure its recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;17.647350993377&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, both &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-infrastructure/u-s-house-democrats-call-for-760-billion-in-infrastructure-spending-over-five-years-idUSKBN1ZS0UZ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-infrastructure/trump-calls-for-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-to-help-economy-during-coronavirus-crisis-idUSKBN21I2F3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have called for major infrastructure investments, only for them not to materialize. These efforts to fund infrastructure investment have focused on the physical world—highways, railroads, bridges. While those are important areas for investment, we must not forget the equal importance of digital infrastructure, especially the free and open-source software (FOSS) that is built mostly by volunteer labor and underpins the digital world. FOSS is even working its way into the physical world, as it is built into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrazdan/2020/07/14/linux-android-and-autonomous-vehicles-who-says-elephants-cannot-dance-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/blog/iot-canonical-and-ges-firstbuild-collaborate-on-smart-refrigerator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;refrigerators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-1066642&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;25.234567901235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSS began in the 1980s as an effort to give developers the ability to tinker with and alter software, which was prevented by most software vendors at the time. This led to the “free” in FOSS being defined as &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Free as in Free Speech, not as in Free Beer,”&lt;/a&gt; although frequently the software was also free of costs. For years, FOSS was primarily the domain of hobbyists, but as computing and the internet became a larger part of daily life, so too did FOSS. The untiring efforts of countless volunteers collaborating remotely eventually led to a robust FOSS ecosystem. Now, FOSS underpins the entire digital economy in the form of operating systems (Linux, Android, etc.), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), and big data and artificial intelligence software (Hadoop, TensorFlow, etc.). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Multi-billion dollar companies&lt;/a&gt; are regularly built on the back of FOSS. Even Microsoft, whose leadership once &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called Linux “a cancer&lt;/a&gt;” and equated it to communism, has now embraced FOSS and uses it as the core of its Azure cloud computing offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;16.469208211144&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic has highlighted, our economy is increasingly reliant on digital infrastructure. As more and more in-person interactions have moved online, products like Zoom have become &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/08/27/zoom-is-now-critical-infrastructure-thats-a-concern/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; supporting business meetings, classroom education, and even congressional hearings. Such communication technologies build on FOSS and rely on the FOSS that is deeply ingrained in the core of the internet. Even grocery shopping, one of the strongholds of brick and mortar retail, has seen an increased reliance on digital technology that allows higher-risk shoppers to pay someone to shop for them via apps like InstaCart (which itself &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instacart.com/opensource&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relies on, and contributes to, FOSS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;13.783783783784&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core infrastructure of the digital world now needs major upgrades. Thirty-five years ago, the federal government &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=106875&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in the National Super Computing Centers (NSCC), which led not only to advances in computer hardware, but also in software – including the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache web server&lt;/a&gt;, now one of the most widely used web servers, and which helped spur the construction of the internet we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;9.6284289276808&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of investments in digital infrastructure tend to see major returns. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w19507&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that NSCC investments saw a rate of return of at least 17% for the Apache software itself, let alone the billions of dollars of technology and commerce that have since been built on top of it. This is more than double the federal government’s commonly used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A94/a094.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;baseline expected rate of return of 7%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;15.825613079019&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although such direct investment is one way to encourage positive, effective outcomes, there are additional cost-effective methods that require less upfront capital outlay. For example, my recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3355486&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that changing federal procurement regulations that favor FOSS over proprietary software can have numerous positive spillovers to the private sector, including increases in company productivity, the number of technology startups founded, and the size of the technology-related labor force. This research shows that the passage of such a law in France led to as much as an 18% increase in the founding of French IT-related startups and as much as a 14% increase in the number of French workers employed in IT-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;14.913544668588&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some FOSS contributors are paid by their employer to contribute, most contributions to FOSS are made without direct compensation. Therefore, another option is to provide tax credits to the people who volunteer their free time to help create and maintain FOSS. A &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S490&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; for such a credit has been introduced in the New York State Assembly every legislative session since 2009 but has never made it out of committee. If passed, this bill would provide a $200 tax credit for expenses related to FOSS development, which would help incentivize more individuals to contribute, likely leading to spillover benefits for the state of New York similar to those from the French procurement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of these levers for FOSS—direct funding, procurement regulation, and tax incentives—should be included in the next infrastructure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;18.037228541882&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the $1.5 trillion &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/house-passes-15-trillion-infrastructure-bill/2020/07/01/6a0a19e8-bbe6-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; recently passed by the House of Representatives includes $100 billion for increasing access to broadband in underserved communities, that only solves the problem of today—it does not lay the groundwork to solve the problems of tomorrow. Our work through the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/census-program-ii/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Core Infrastructure Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a joint project between Harvard’s Laboratory for Innovation Science and the Linux Foundation, has shown there are significant vulnerabilities in the core infrastructure of the digital economy that, unaddressed, could lead to significant problems down the road. These vulnerabilities include: a heavy reliance on FOSS components that are outdated or not regularly maintained, a lack of both transparency and consistent naming conventions, making it difficult for companies to update their software properly, and a lack of project governance safeguards, which could allow malicious actors to insert backdoors into FOSS projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;15.928306551298&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the magnitude of the vulnerabilities contained in widely deployed open-source code, consider the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL, which affected nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/04/08/half-a-million-widely-trusted-websites-vulnerable-to-heartbleed-bug.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;20% of secure websites on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 a bug was mistakenly introduced into the project’s underlying code. Heartbleed went undiscovered for two years, partly because the project was being maintained by only one full-time engineer and a few part-time volunteers. The Core Infrastructure Initiative was launched in response to Heartbleed, and major technology companies like Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft donated millions to better support OpenSSL and other critical FOSS projects. Firms that normally compete against each other realized that FOSS is so critical to the digital economy that they need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt; to help secure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;core-block&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSS projects are too vital to modern commerce and communications to rely on the benevolence of the private sector alone. The federal government also needs to play its part. Future infrastructure bills should also include new funding and incentives for FOSS development and maintenance. For our economy to recover and grow tomorrow, we need to invest in our open-source digital infrastructure today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Dropbox Converts to Permanent WFH</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-letting-all-employees-work-from-home-permanently-2020-10</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-letting-all-employees-work-from-home-permanently-2020-10</guid>
<description>&lt;ul class=&quot;summary-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dropbox just announced it would allow all employees to work from home permanently. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company initially ordered staff to work from home in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-halts-recruiting-onboarding-strains-work-from-home-2020-3&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;summary_bullets&quot;&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company plans to convert its existing offices to coworking spaces to aid in team building and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;While we know we may not get it 100% right immediately, we wanted to take this opportunity to fundamentally redesign how we work, and be more intentional and prescriptive with the guidance we're giving to our employees,&quot; a Dropbox spokesperson told Business Insider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;summary_bullets&quot;&gt;Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is going remote — permanently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud-storage company announced Tuesday it would allow all employees to work from home going forward. The shift comes after an internal survey found nearly 90% of Dropbox workers said they were more productive at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Starting today, Dropbox is becoming a Virtual First company,&quot; the company said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Remote work (outside an office) will be the primary experience for all employees and the day-to-day default for individual work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox initially ordered employees to work from home to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-halts-recruiting-onboarding-strains-work-from-home-2020-3&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company will convert its existing real estate into flexible coworking spaces called Dropbox Studios, where employees can choose to go in to work. These spaces are primarily for team building and collaboration, not for &quot;solo work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said since this approach is &quot;brand new,&quot; the program could change depending on feedback from staff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we know we may not get it 100% right immediately, we wanted to take this opportunity to fundamentally redesign how we work, and be more intentional and prescriptive with the guidance we're giving to our employees,&quot; a Dropbox spokesperson told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox has offices in San Francisco, Seattle, Dublin, and Austin, Texas, but said it may build more flexible studios in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company will also allow for greater employee relocation outside cities where there are offices. To help employees in different time zones work together, the company will allow each worker to decide their own work hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox joins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-permanently-2020-5&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/atlassian-says-employees-they-can-work-from-home-permanently-2020-8&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; as major firms that have allowed all employees to permanently work from home.

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Hi, I’m He Yang (@kernel.bin), one of the GSoC-2020 students of ReactOS. How time flies, three months have passed and now GSoC is coming to an end. During the last three months, I’ve been working on rapps, and I’ve made some small progress on it: improving rapps by increasing it’s functionality, stability, and make the code more well-organized. During GSoC, I’ve acquired a lot of coding skills and knowledge about Win32.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The persecution of the Uyghurs is a crime against humanity</title>

<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;article__aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;time itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/DateTime&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-10-17T00:00:00Z&quot; class=&quot;article__dateline-datetime&quot;&gt;Oct 17th 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HE FIRST&lt;/small&gt; stories from Xinjiang were hard to believe. Surely the Chinese government was not running a gulag for Muslims? Surely Uyghurs were not being branded “extremists” and locked up simply for praying in public or growing long beards? Yet, as we report in this week’s China section (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2020/10/17/how-xinjiangs-gulag-tears-families-apart&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;), the evidence of a campaign against the Uyghurs at home and abroad becomes more shocking with each scouring of the satellite evidence, each leak of official documents and each survivor’s pitiful account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In 2018 the government pivoted from denying the camps’ existence to calling them “vocational education and training centres”—a kindly effort to help backward people gain marketable skills. The world should instead heed Uyghur victims of China’s coercive indoctrination. Month after month, inmates say, they are drilled to renounce extremism and put their faith in “Xi Jinping Thought” rather than the Koran. One told us that guards ask prisoners if there is a God, and beat those who say there is. And the camps are only part of a vast system of social control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;China’s 12m Uyghurs are a small, disaffected minority. Their Turkic language is distant from Chinese. They are mostly Muslim. A tiny handful have carried out terrorist attacks, including a bombing in a market in 2014 that left 43 people dead. No terrorist incidents have occurred since 2017: proof, the government says, that tighter security and anti-extremism classes have made Xinjiang safe again. That is one way of putting it. Another is that, rather than catching the violent few, the government has in effect put all Uyghurs into an open-air prison. The aim appears to be to crush the spirit of an entire people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Even those outside the camps have to attend indoctrination sessions. Any who fail to gush about China’s president risk internment. Families must watch other families, and report suspicious behaviour. New evidence suggests that hundreds of thousands of Uyghur children may have been separated from one or both detained parents. Many of these temporary orphans are in boarding schools, where they are punished for speaking their own language. Party cadres, usually Han Chinese, are stationed in Uyghur homes, a policy known as “becoming kin”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Rules against having too many children are strictly enforced on Uyghur women; some are sterilised. Official data show that in two prefectures the Uyghur birth rate fell by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018. Uyghur women are urged to marry Han Chinese men and rewarded if they do with a flat, a job or even a relative being spared the camps. Intimidation extends beyond China’s borders. Because all contact with the outside world is deemed suspect, Uyghurs abroad fear calling home lest they cause a loved one to be arrested, as a harrowing report in &lt;em&gt;1843&lt;/em&gt;, our sister magazine, describes (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/10/15/if-i-speak-out-they-will-torture-my-family-voices-of-uyghurs-in-exile&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The persecution of the Uyghurs is a crime against humanity: it entails the forced transfer of people, the imprisonment of an identifiable group and the disappearance of individuals. Systematically imposed by a government, it is the most extensive violation in the world today of the principle that individuals have a right to liberty and dignity simply because they are people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;China’s ruling party has no truck with this concept of individual rights. It claims legitimacy from its record of providing stability and economic growth to the many. Its appeal to the majority may well command popular support. Accurate polling is all but impossible in a dictatorship, and censorship insulates ordinary Chinese from the truth about their rulers. But many Chinese people clearly do back their government, especially since to object is deemed unpatriotic (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2020/10/17/china-calls-its-heroic-handling-of-covid-19-proof-of-its-wisdom&quot; data-tegid=&quot;i9cr29dtos4nuk2bl8oc10av79a4jbjt&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). Awkward minorities, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs, have no protection in such a system. Unbound by notions of individual rights, the regime has been determined to terrorise them into submission and force them to assimilate into the dominant Han culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;China lies at the extreme of a worrying trend. Globally, democracy and human rights are in retreat. Although this began before covid-19, 80 countries have regressed since the pandemic began and only Malawi has improved, says Freedom House, a think-tank. Many people, when scared, yearn to be led to safety by a strong ruler. The virus offers governments an excuse to seize emergency powers and ban protests (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights&quot; data-tegid=&quot;c61o16vjphgvi0of8kfscn6rv5gqpr33&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Abusive rulers often rally the majority against a minority. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, espouses an aggressive Hindu nationalism and treats India’s Muslims as if they were not really citizens. For this, he earns stellar approval ratings. So does Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who urges the murder of criminal suspects. Hungary’s prime minister crushes democratic institutions and says his opponents are part of a Jewish plot. Brazil’s president celebrates torture and claims that his foreign critics want to colonise the Amazon. In Thailand the king is turning a constitutional monarchy into an absolute one (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/node/21792837&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;How can those who value liberty resist? Human rights are universal, but many associate them with the West. So when the West’s reputation took a battering, after the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the botched war in Iraq, respect for human rights did, too. Although America has imposed targeted sanctions over the Uyghurs, the suspicion that Western preaching was hypocritical has grown under Donald Trump. A transactional president, he has argued that national sovereignty should come first—and not only for America. That suits China just fine. It is working in international forums to redefine human rights as being about subsistence and development, not individual dignity and freedom. This week, along with Russia, it was elected to the &lt;small&gt;UN&lt;/small&gt; Human Rights Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start in Xinjiang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Resistance to the erosion of human rights should begin with the Uyghurs. If liberals say nothing about today’s single worst violation outside a war zone, how can anyone believe their criticism of other, lesser crimes? Activists should expose and document abuse. Writers and artists can say why human dignity is precious. Companies can refuse to collude. There is talk of boycotts—including, even, of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Ultimately, governments will need to act. They should offer asylum to Uyghurs and, like America, slap targeted sanctions on abusive officials and ban goods made with forced Uyghur labour. They should speak up, too. China’s regime is not impervious to shame. If it were proud of its harsh actions in Xinjiang, it would not try to hide them. Nor would it lean on smaller countries to sign statements endorsing its policies there. As the scale of the horror emerges, its propaganda has grown less effective: 15 majority-Muslim countries that had signed such statements have changed their mind. China’s image has grown darker in many countries in recent years, polls suggest: 86% of Japanese and 85% of Swedes now have an unfavourable view of the country. For a government that seeks to project soft power, this is a worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Some say the West would lose too much by lecturing about human rights—China won’t change, and the acrimony will stymie talks about trade, pandemics and climate change. True, keeping human rights separate from such things is impossible, and China will try to convince other countries that moral candour will cause them economic harm. Nonetheless, liberal democracies have an obligation to call a gulag a gulag. In an age of growing global competition, that is what makes them different. If they fail to stand up for liberal values they should not be surprised if others do not respect them, either. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
