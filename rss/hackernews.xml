<title>WHO declares coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-reconvenes-assess-latest-coronavirus-1.5445775</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-reconvenes-assess-latest-coronavirus-1.5445775</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A World Health Organization (WHO) panel declared the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that has killed 213 people a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced the decision&lt;/a&gt; after a meeting of its emergency committee, an independent panel of experts, amid mounting evidence of the virus's spread from China to 19 countries — with Italy the latest to report cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;inread-wrapper-id-4779061&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Let me be clear, this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,&quot; Tedros said. &quot;Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Friday, Chinese health authorities raised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/1.5445583&quot;&gt;death toll in the country to 213.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The WHO panel, chaired by Didier Houssin of France, is composed of 16 independent experts. Twice last week the experts decided not to declare an emergency while they sought more information from China and awaited evidence of confirmed person-to-person spread of the virus in other countries, so as to meet their criteria for a global emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;similarLinks&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;similarListItem&quot;&gt;&lt;span/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;labelText external&quot;&gt;Updated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;similarLinkText&quot;&gt;Coronavirus death toll rises to 213 in China&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations health agency defines an international emergency as an &quot;extraordinary event&quot; that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response. The declaration triggers recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease, while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It covers temporary recommendations for national health authorities worldwide, which include stepping up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a wake-up call for the world to pay attention to it,&quot; Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease physician in Toronto, told CBC News. &quot;I don't think it changes much what we do here in Canada.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the WHO has no legal authority to sanction countries, it could ask governments to provide scientific justification for any travel or trade restrictions that they impose in the event of an international emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A declaration of a public health emergency of international concern — known as a PHEIC in WHO jargon — is rare. Only five have been declared in the past decade: The H1N1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic in 2009, West Africa's Ebola outbreak, polio in 2014, Zika virus in 2016 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WHO 'very impressed' by China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, WHO's emergencies chief told reporters that China was taking &quot;extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge&quot; posed by the coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted,&quot; said Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme who accompanied the body's chief on a trip to China this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge,&quot; he said, referring to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person-to-person spread of the new coronavirus is worrying and would be considered by experts reconvened to consider declaring a global emergency, the WHO said Wednesday. As of Thursday, the countries with such instances include the United States, Germany, Vietnam and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WATCH | WHO 'very impressed' by China's handling of coronavirus:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;The World Health Organization is praising China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, calling it 'highly organized.' 1:21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus. International solidarity is extremely important and for that purpose all countries should behave in a ... responsible manner,&quot; Zhang Jun, China's ambassador to the United Nations, said in response to the WHO declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we understand the concerns of other countries, we should also listen to the advice of [the] WHO director-general,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;He said he had full confidence in China's efforts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang noted that it was important to avoid &quot;overreactions, which may result in spillover negative effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Jan. 30, about 99 per cent of the more than 7,700 cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at two per cent, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate, and it's likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the SARS virus killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/&quot;&gt;about 10 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of people who caught it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While this is likely more contagious than SARS, it's not nearly as contagious as influenza or we'd already have it widespread here in Canada,&quot; Gardam said. &quot;The mortality rate of two per cent looks very scary, but we know that's going to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So this is not as dangerous as SARS was and it's not as contagious as influenza.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO director-general said that during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he was &quot;was very encouraged and impressed by the president's detailed knowledge of the outbreak and his personal involvement in the outbreak. This, for me, is real leadership.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tedros, asked about an international team to be sent to China, said it would be composed of WHO staff, and countries should make &quot;bilateral arrangements&quot; to send their own experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My day was completely ruined yesterday when I stumbled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;upon a fun fact that absolutely obliterated my mind. I saw this tweet yesterday that said that not everyone has an internal monologue in their head. All my life, I could hear my voice in my head and speak in full sentences as if I was talking out loud. I thought everyone experienced this, so I did not believe that it could be true at that time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Literally the first person I asked was a classmate of mine who said that she can not “hear” her voice in her mind. I asked her if she could have a conversation with herself in her&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;head and she looked at me funny like I was the weird one in this situation.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So I began to become more intrigued. Most peo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ple I asked said that they have this internal monologue that is running ram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;pant throughout the day. However, every once in a &lt;span&gt;while, someone would say that they don’t experience this.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My life began to slowly spiral out of co&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ntrol with millions of questions. How do they get through the day? H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ow do they read? How do they make decisions betwe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;en choice A and choice B? My friend described it as “concept maps” that she sees in her brain. Another friend says that she&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;literally sees the words in her head if she is trying to think about something. I was taking ibuprofen at this point in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;day because my brain was literally unable to comprehend this revelation. How have I made it 25 years in life without realizing that people don’t think like me? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Currently 91 people have responded that they have an internal monologue and 18 people reported that they do not have this. I began asking those people questions about the things that they experience and it is quite d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ifferent from the majority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would tell them that I could look at myself in the mirror and have a full blown telepathic conversation with myself without opening my mouth and th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ey responded as if I had schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;One p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;erson even mentioned that when they do voice overs in movies of people’s thoughts, they “wished that it was real.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Another person said that if they tried to have a conversation with themselves in the mirror, they would have to speak out loud because they can’t physically do it inside of their mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

People were telling me that I ruined their day and that they now do not understand anyth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ing about life. Maybe you are all just a figment of my imagination, but regardless, yesterday made reality seem even more skewed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do they think? How does this affect their relationships, jobs, experiences, education? How has this not been mentioned to me before? All of these quest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ions started flooding my mind. Can those people without the internal monologue even formulate these questions in their mind? If they can, how does it happen if they don’t “hear” their voice?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I mentioned earlier that I was spiraling out of control. Well, as I write this and as I hear my own voice in my head, I am continuing to fall down the rabbit hole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether peop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;le just have different definitions of their thoughts, or if people literally don’t have an internal monologue, there is one thing that we do know… you will definitely get a headache if you keep thinking about this. Just trying to wrap my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;head around it is causing irrevers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ible brain damage. I suggest asking people around you what they experience. If you are one of the few that do not have this internal monologue, please enlighten me, because I still do not understand life anymore. Send help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Monoliths Are the Future</title>
<link>https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you’re about to read is an excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/gotime/114&quot;&gt;Go Time #114&lt;/a&gt;. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/gotime/114#transcript-96&quot;&gt;original transcript&lt;/a&gt; or listen to the entire conversation for more context. To set the stage, this is the 2nd of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower&quot;&gt;Kelsey Hightower’s&lt;/a&gt; unpopular opinions (our new segment which people seem to be enjoying.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monoliths are the future because the problem people are trying to solve with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices&quot;&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t really line up with reality. Just to be honest - and I’ve done this before, gone from microservices to monoliths and back again. Both directions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people say,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.26953125&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Look, we lost all of our discipline in the monolith. We just started creating classes, this person went and bought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns&quot;&gt;Gang of Four book&lt;/a&gt;, came back and started doing design patterns and then &lt;em&gt;QUIT&lt;/em&gt;, so half our codebase is doing this thing over here…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So now it’s a nightmare. Now the codebase is so bad, and you say,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You know what we should do? We should break it up. We’re gonna break it up and &lt;mark&gt;somehow find the engineering discipline we never had in the first place&lt;/mark&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then what they end up doing is creating 50 deployables, but it’s really a &lt;em&gt;distributed&lt;/em&gt; monolith. So it’s actually the same thing, but instead of function calls and class instantiation, they’re initiating things and throwing it over a network and hoping that it comes back. And since they can’t reliably &lt;em&gt;make it&lt;/em&gt; come back, they introduce things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentracing.io&quot;&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt;, all of this stuff. I’m like, &lt;strong&gt;“What are you doing?!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Now you went from writing bad code to building bad infrastructure&lt;/mark&gt; that you deploy the bad code on top of. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; reasons that you do a microservice. So, to me a microservice makes sense in the context of…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’re a bank, and you have this big monolith that does everything. Then mobile comes out. You wanna do mobile banking, but it requires a different set of APIs. You don’t have to add that to the monolith. You can go create a new application that handles most of the mobile concerns, and then connect back to the existing infrastructure to do its work. That makes sense to me. But this idea of “microservices are a best practice” - it seems to be unpopular with most people’s &lt;em&gt;initiatives&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re like,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.2660550458716&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, we’re bringing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/topic/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, so we can do microservices. We are going to rearchitect everything.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because it drives a lot of new spend, it drives a lot of new hiring…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So a lot of people get addicted to all the flourishment of money, and marketing, and it’s just a lot of buzz that people are attaching their assignment to, when honestly &lt;mark&gt;it’s not gonna necessarily solve their problem&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hear Kelsey’s expert opinion on where Kubernetes is headed (and more)&lt;/em&gt; 👇&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tell HN: Mailgun lowers free-tier API from 10k to 625 emails per month</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22192543</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22192543</guid>
<description>Email:
&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mailgun is adjusting our plans and pricing to more accurately reflect the value users get from the service and to make room for some great new deliverability features we just released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2019, we were hard at work adding and improving our email capabilities and optimizing our support to help your business grow. While many of these updates were made behind the scenes, the truth is that Mailgun can do a lot more than it could two years ago when we last updated our plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you? On March 1, 2020, we will automatically transition your account to the new Flex plan, a pay-as-you-go plan comparable to the Concept plan you’re currently on. You’ll receive your first invoice under the new plan on April 1 if your amount due is greater than $0.50. According to your usage last month, your invoice under the new price per message of $0.0008 would have been $0 for December. It’s a modest change, but we wanted to be transparent about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s changing with the Flex plan? Flex offers you the same pay-per-use model you were used to on the Concept plan. The main differences are that we are no longer offering 10,000 free emails or 100 free validations per month, and our support options now include limited ticket support as well as enhanced self-service Q&amp;amp;As so you can find answers faster. Additionally, while your existing routes will still be functional, new routes will not be supported on this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other options do I have? We have several other plans available with additional features and service levels, including a new subscription plan called Foundation that starts at $35 per month. This plan provides access to new deliverability tools like Inbox Placement so you can effortlessly increase your deliverability and email ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for validations, inbound routing, or more support? Foundation is a great starter plan. If this is something you’re interested in, check out your plan options.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The spine of San Francisco is now car-free</title>
<link>https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2020/01/market-street-car-free-san-francisco-bike-lanes-transit/605674/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2020/01/market-street-car-free-san-francisco-bike-lanes-transit/605674/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a city known for stunning vistas, San Francisco’s Market Street offers a notoriously ugly tangle of traffic. Cars and delivery trucks vie with bikes and pedestrians along this downtown corridor, as buses and a historic streetcar clatter through the mix. Dedicated lanes for transit and bikes end abruptly several blocks from the street’s terminus at the edge of the San Francisco Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the vehicular frenzy is ending, in part: Starting Wednesday, private vehicles—meaning both passenger automobiles and for-hire ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft—may no longer drive down Market, east of 10th Street. Only buses, streetcars, traditional taxis, ambulances, and freight drop-offs are still allowed. The closure to private vehicle traffic heralds the start of a new era for the city’s central spine, and perhaps for San Francisco at large, as it joins cities around the world that are restricting cars from downtown centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to do better than use Market as a queuing place for the Bay Bridge,” said Jeffrey Tumlin, the newly arrived executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. “Today represents the way the world is finally changing how it thinks about the role of transportation in cities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/10/car-free-san-francisco-market-street-design-bikes-streetcar/599983/&quot;&gt;decades of debate&lt;/a&gt;, the vision for a car-free Market Street has arrived at a remarkable level of support among activists, politicians, planners, and businesses. (Especially compared to the rancor and legal challenges that greeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/10/better-bus-system-public-transit-book-cities-federal-funding/599776/&quot;&gt;New York City’s long-delayed effort to create a car-free busway&lt;/a&gt; along 14th Street in Manhattan.) In October, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s board of directors voted unanimously in support of a $600 million “Better Market Street” capital construction plan. Ground is set to break on construction for a protected bikeway, repaved sidewalk, fresh streetscaping, and updated streetcar infrastructure by the start of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Market Street is the heart of San Francisco’s transportation network, and I’m incredibly excited that it is finally being returned to pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement. “San Francisco continues to grow and our streets need to reflect what it means to be a world-class city that prioritizes our transit-first policy, our climate action goals, and our commitment to ensuring that everyone can travel safely and reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is kicking off this infrastructural transformation with the private car ban, with the aim to reduce crashes amid a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/11/vision-zero-data-traffic-deaths-pedestrians-cyclist-safety/601831/&quot;&gt;Vision Zero&lt;/a&gt;” traffic safety push. Market Street sees about 100 injury collisions per year; traffic fatalities spiked to 29 citywide in 2019. Now, new signage and traffic enforcement will alert drivers of turn and parking restrictions, while bus-only lanes will be extended further east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This should make our intersections run better and safer,” said Cristina Olea, an engineer with San Francisco Public Works and the project manager of Better Market Street. “Transit will be more reliable, it’ll run smoother. There will be less friction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco’s car-free move is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/12/car-free-streets-plans-sf-market-street-new-york-europe-us/603391/&quot;&gt;wave of cities&lt;/a&gt; around the globe pedestrianizing their downtown cores and corridors, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/nyregion/car-ban-14th-street-manhattan.html&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/07/madrid-car-ban-street-map-city-politics-mayor-court-decision/594487/&quot;&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-51088499&quot;&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;. And there are signs that SF’s effort will not end at Market Street: Local officials in the city are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-lawmaker-proposes-car-free-tenderloin-streets/&quot;&gt;calling to remove cars&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelswan/status/1222232707561734144?s=20&quot;&gt;other sections of the city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bay Area transportation leaders are also considering adopting congestion pricing, in which fees for driving into busy parts of San Francisco would be used to fund transit, biking, and other car-free modes. Cheap gas, the tech boom, and the rise of ride-hailing have meant the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2019/01/sfmta_mobility_trends_report_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;traffic entering San Francisco has grown by 27 percent since 2010&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is that making congestion increasingly miserable, with average travel speeds on corridors like Market Street &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2019/01/sfmta_mobility_trends_report_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;dropping nearly 20 percent&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also foiling this famously progressive city’s efforts to meet its climate goals. Already, greenhouse gases from transportation make up almost half of San Francisco’s overall emissions. As its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kqed.org/news/11741275/map-the-bay-area-leads-california-in-population-growth&quot;&gt;population grows&lt;/a&gt;, leaders say that the Bay Area must find ways to help more people move along the same amount of street space, and with a lower environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For most of the 20th century, there was a belief that the primary function of our transportation infrastructure was reducing congestion. Most people would agree that those efforts failed,” said Tumlin. “If we want cities to exist, we have to to use our abilities to cut emissions through transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/sovereign/sovereign&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e3caf2e9799da7f914402217ed5589ffae2a45d3/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f736f7665726569676e2f736f7665726569676e2e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/sovereign/sovereign.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9f0a9888efef1a732b9f23f630844bb5c23738d/68747470733a2f2f626573747072616374696365732e636f7265696e6672617374727563747572652e6f72672f70726f6a656374732f3436302f6261646765&quot; alt=&quot;CII Best Practices&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/460/badge&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sovereign is a set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ansible.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; playbooks that you can use to build and maintain your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clown%20computing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;personal cloud&lt;/a&gt; based entirely on open source software, so you’re in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never used Ansible before, you might find these playbooks useful to learn from, since they show off a fair bit of what the tool can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original author's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/wiki/Background-and-Motivations&quot;&gt;background and motivations&lt;/a&gt; might be of interest. tl;dr: frustrations with Google Apps and concerns about privacy and long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereign offers useful cloud services while being reasonably secure and low-maintenance. Use it to set up your server, SSH in every couple weeks, but mostly forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Services Provided&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you get if you point Sovereign at a server? All kinds of good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t want one or more of the above services? Comment out the relevant role in &lt;code&gt;site.yml&lt;/code&gt;. Or get more granular and comment out the associated &lt;code&gt;include:&lt;/code&gt; directive in one of the playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What You’ll Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A VPS (or bare-metal server if you wanna ball hard). My VPS is hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com/?r=45405878277aa04ee1f1d21394285da6b43f963b&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll probably want at least 512 MB of RAM between Apache, Solr, and PostgreSQL. Mine has 1024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;64-bit Debian 8.3&lt;/a&gt; or an equivalent Linux distribution. (You can use whatever distro you want, but deviating from Debian will require more tweaks to the playbooks. See Ansible’s different &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_packaging_modules.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;packaging&lt;/a&gt; modules.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tarsnap.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tarsnap&lt;/a&gt; account with some credit in it. You could comment this out if you want to use a different backup service. Consider paying your hosting provider for backups or using an additional backup service for redundancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need to acquire an SSL certificate. The SSL certificates you need will be obtained from &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; automatically when you deploy your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the remote server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following steps are done on the remote server by &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;ing into it and running these commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Install required packages e.g &lt;code&gt;aptitude&lt;/code&gt; is required on Debian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;apt-get install sudo python
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Get a Tarsnap machine key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarsnap.com/download.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;download and install Tarsnap&lt;/a&gt;, or use &lt;code&gt;brew install tarsnap&lt;/code&gt; if you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new machine key for your server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tarsnap-keygen --keyfile roles/tarsnap/files/decrypted_tarsnap.key --user me@example.com --machine example.com
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Prep the server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For goodness sake, change the root password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;passwd
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a user account for Ansible to do its thing through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;useradd deploy
passwd deploy
mkdir /home/deploy
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorize your ssh key if you want passwordless ssh login (optional):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
nano /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 400 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown deploy:deploy /home/deploy -R
echo 'deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' &amp;gt; /etc/sudoers.d/deploy
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your new account will be automatically set up for passwordless &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. Or you can just add your &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; user to the sudo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;adduser deploy sudo
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On your local machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible (the tool setting up your server) runs locally on your computer and sends commands to the remote server. Download this repository somewhere on your machine, either through &lt;code&gt;Clone or Download &amp;gt; Download ZIP&lt;/code&gt; above, &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; as below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Configure your installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the settings in the &lt;code&gt;group_vars/sovereign&lt;/code&gt; folder to your liking. If you want to see how they’re used in context, just search for the corresponding string. All of the variables in &lt;code&gt;group_vars/sovereign&lt;/code&gt; must be set for sovereign to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Git hosting, copy your public key into place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub roles/git/files/gitolite.pub
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, replace the &lt;code&gt;host.example.net&lt;/code&gt; in the file &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt;. If your SSH daemon listens on a non-standard port, add a colon and the port number after the IP address. In that case you also need to add your custom port to the task &lt;code&gt;Set firewall rules for web traffic and SSH&lt;/code&gt; in the file &lt;code&gt;roles/common/tasks/ufw.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Set up DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve just bought a new domain name, point it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.linode.com/dns-manager&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Linode’s DNS Manager&lt;/a&gt; or similar. Most VPS services (and even some domain registrars) offer a managed DNS service that you can use for this at no charge. If you’re using an existing domain that’s already managed elsewhere, you can probably just modify a few records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; records which point to your server's IP address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mail.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for Web hosting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;autoconfig.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for email client automatic configuration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;read.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for Wallabag)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;news.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for Selfoss)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cloud.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for ownCloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git.example.com&lt;/code&gt; (for cgit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Run the Ansible Playbooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#getting-ansible&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;got Ansible 1.9.3+ installed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the whole dang thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook -i ./hosts --ask-sudo-pass site.yml
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you chose to make a passwordless sudo deploy user, you can omit the &lt;code&gt;--ask-sudo-pass&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run just one or more piece, use tags. I try to tag all my includes for easy isolated development. For example, to focus in on your firewall setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook -i ./hosts --tags=ufw site.yml
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might find that it fails at one point or another. This is probably because something needs to be done manually, usually because there’s no good way of automating it. Fortunately, all the tasks are clearly named so you should be able to find out where it stopped. I’ve tried to add comments where manual intervention is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; tag just installs dependencies, performing no other operations. The tasks associated with the &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; tag do not rely on the user-provided settings that live in &lt;code&gt;group_vars/sovereign&lt;/code&gt;. Running the playbook with the &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; tag is particularly convenient for working with Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Finish DNS set-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; record for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; which assigns &lt;code&gt;mail.example.com&lt;/code&gt; as the domain’s mail server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure your emails pass DKIM checks you need to add a &lt;code&gt;txt&lt;/code&gt; record. The name field will be &lt;code&gt;default._domainkey.EXAMPLE.COM.&lt;/code&gt; The value field contains the public key used by DKIM. The exact value needed can be found in the file &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/EXAMPLE.COM.default.txt&lt;/code&gt;. It will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDKKAQfMwKVx+oJripQI+Ag4uTwYnsXKjgBGtl7Tk6UMTUwhMqnitqbR/ZQEZjcNolTkNDtyKZY2Z6LqvM4KsrITpiMbkV1eX6GKczT8Lws5KXn+6BHCKULGdireTAUr3Id7mtjLrbi/E3248Pq0Zs39hkDxsDcve12WccjafJVwIDAQAB
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For DMARC you'll also need to add a &lt;code&gt;txt&lt;/code&gt; record. The name field should be &lt;code&gt;_dmarc.EXAMPLE.COM&lt;/code&gt; and the value should be &lt;code&gt;v=DMARC1; p=none&lt;/code&gt;. More info on DMARC can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://dmarc.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up SPF and reverse DNS &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;as per this post&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to validate that it’s all working, for example, by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:check-auth@verifier.port25.com&quot;&gt;check-auth@verifier.port25.com&lt;/a&gt; and reviewing the report that will be emailed back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Miscellaneous Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign in to the ZNC web interface and set things up to your liking. It isn’t exposed through the firewall, so you must first set up an SSH tunnel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ssh deploy@example.com -L 6643:localhost:6643
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then proceed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:6643&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:6643&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, to access the server monitoring page, use another SSH tunnel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ssh deploy@example.com -L 2812:localhost:2812
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again proceeding to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:2812&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:2812&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, sign into ownCloud with a new administrator account to set it up. You should select PostgreSQL as the configuration backend. Use &lt;code&gt;owncloud&lt;/code&gt; as the database user and the database name. For the database password ansible has created a set of random passwords for each service and stores them in your local folder &lt;code&gt;secret&lt;/code&gt;, use the one in the file &lt;code&gt;owncloud_db_password&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Use Your New Personal Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re collecting known-good client setups &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/wiki/Usage&quot;&gt;on our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into an errors, please check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/wiki/Troubleshooting&quot;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;. If the problem you encountered, is not listed, please go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/issues/new&quot;&gt;create an issue&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have a bugfix and/or workaround, just put them in the issue and the wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reboots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to manually enter the password for any encrypted volumes on reboot. This is not Sovereign-specific, but rather a function of how EncFS works. This will necessitate SSHing into your machine after reboot, or accessing it via a console interface if one is available to you. Once you're in, run this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;encfs /encrypted /decrypted --public
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that some daemons may need to be restarted after you enter your password for the encrypted volume(s). Some services may stall out while looking for resources that will only be available once the &lt;code&gt;/decrypted&lt;/code&gt; volume is available and visible to daemon user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask questions and provide feedback in &lt;code&gt;#sovereign&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://freenode.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Command-line tools can be faster than a Hadoop cluster (2014)</title>

<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/&quot;&gt;Tom Hayden&lt;/a&gt; about using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/&quot;&gt;Amazon Elastic Map Reduce&lt;/a&gt; (EMR) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob&quot;&gt;mrjob&lt;/a&gt; in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm&quot;&gt;millionbase archive&lt;/a&gt;, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).
&lt;p&gt;After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called &lt;em&gt;Big Data ™&lt;/em&gt; tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://storm-project.net/&quot;&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern &lt;em&gt;Big Data ™&lt;/em&gt; tools.
&lt;p&gt;An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-about-the-data&quot;&gt;Learn about the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[Event &quot;F/S Return Match&quot;]
[Site &quot;Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG&quot;]
[Date &quot;1992.11.04&quot;]
[Round &quot;29&quot;]
[White &quot;Fischer, Robert J.&quot;]
[Black &quot;Spassky, Boris V.&quot;]
[Result &quot;1/2-1/2&quot;]
(moves from the game follow...)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; case means the game was a draw. There is also a &lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;acquire-sample-data&quot;&gt;Acquire sample data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rozim/ChessData&quot;&gt;rozim&lt;/a&gt; that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.
&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-a-processing-pipeline&quot;&gt;Build a processing pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sleep &lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello world.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print &lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt; but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat *.pgn &amp;gt; /dev/null&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; to generate the stream of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat *.pgn | grep &lt;span&gt;&quot;Result&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will give us only the &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt; commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat *.pgn | grep &lt;span&gt;&quot;Result&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | sort | uniq -c&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the &lt;code&gt;sort | uniq&lt;/code&gt; steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat *.pgn | grep &lt;span&gt;&quot;Result&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | awk &lt;span&gt;'{ split($0, a, &quot;-&quot;); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; while this is running shows that &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;parallelize-the-bottlenecks&quot;&gt;Parallelize the bottlenecks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; command, which will allow us to parallelize the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;-print0&lt;/code&gt; argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; is null-terminated. The corresponding &lt;code&gt;-0&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; how many inputs to give each process and the &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The &lt;code&gt;-F&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;find . -type f -name &lt;span&gt;'*.pgn'&lt;/span&gt; -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F &lt;span&gt;&quot;Result&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | gawk &lt;span&gt;'{ split($0, a, &quot;-&quot;); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;find . -type f -name &lt;span&gt;'*.pgn'&lt;/span&gt; -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk &lt;span&gt;'/Result/ { split($0, a, &quot;-&quot;); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of &lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt; file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;find . -type f -name &lt;span&gt;'*.pgn'&lt;/span&gt; -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk &lt;span&gt;'/Result/ { split($0, a, &quot;-&quot;); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt; | awk &lt;span&gt;'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can make it a bit faster still by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html&quot;&gt;mawk&lt;/a&gt;, which is often a drop-in replacement for &lt;code&gt;gawk&lt;/code&gt; and can offer better performance.
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;find . -type f -name &lt;span&gt;'*.pgn'&lt;/span&gt; -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk &lt;span&gt;'/Result/ { split($0, a, &quot;-&quot;); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt; | mawk &lt;span&gt;'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;find | xargs mawk | mawk&lt;/code&gt; pipeline gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB/sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop for data processing tasks that can better be accomplished on a single machine with simple shell commands and tools. If you have a huge amount of data or really need distributed processing, then tools like Hadoop may be required, but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used where a traditional relational database or other solutions would be far better in terms of performance, cost of implementation, and ongoing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</og:title>
<og:description>Introduction As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from Tom Hayden about using Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) and mrjob in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the millionbase archive, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.</og:description>
