<title>Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt&amp;#039;s New Root and Intermediate Certificates</title>
<link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/09/17/new-root-and-intermediates.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letsencrypt.org/2020/09/17/new-root-and-intermediates.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, September 3rd, 2020, Let’s Encrypt issued six new certificates: one root, four intermediates, and one cross-sign. These new certificates are part of our larger plan to improve privacy on the web, by making ECDSA end-entity certificates widely available, and by making certificates smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that we issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/&quot;&gt;1.5 million certificates every day&lt;/a&gt;, what makes these ones special? Why did we issue them? How did we issue them? Let’s answer these questions, and in the process take a tour of how Certificate Authorities think and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every publicly-trusted Certificate Authority (such as Let’s Encrypt) has at least one root certificate which is incorporated into various browser and OS vendors’ (e.g. Mozilla, Google) trusted root stores. This is what allows users who receive a certificate from a website to confirm that the certificate was issued by an organization that their browser trusts. But root certificates, by virtue of their widespread trust and long lives, must have their corresponding private key carefully protected and stored offline, and therefore can’t be used to sign things all the time. So every Certificate Authority (CA) also has some number of “intermediates”, certificates which are able to issue additional certificates but are not roots, which they use for day-to-day issuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2015/06/04/isrg-ca-certs.html&quot;&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, Let’s Encrypt has had one root: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=7394&quot;&gt;ISRG Root X1&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 4096-bit RSA key and is valid until 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over that same time, we’ve had four intermediates: the Let’s Encrypt Authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=7395&quot;&gt;X1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=9745&quot;&gt;X2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=16418&quot;&gt;X3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=16429&quot;&gt;X4&lt;/a&gt;. The first two were issued when Let’s Encrypt first began operations in 2015, and were valid for 5 years. The latter two were issued about a year later, in 2016, and are also valid for 5 years, expiring about this time next year. All of these intermediates use 2048-bit RSA keys. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html&quot;&gt;all of these intermediates are cross-signed&lt;/a&gt; by IdenTrust’s DST Root CA X3, another root certificate controlled by a different certificate authority which is trusted by most root stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?id=2929281974&quot;&gt;ISRG Root OCSP X1&lt;/a&gt; certificate. This one is a little different – it doesn’t issue any certificates. Instead, it signs Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses that indicate the intermediate certificates have not been revoked. This is important because the only other thing capable of signing such statements is our root itself, and as mentioned above, the root needs to stay offline and safely secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/images/2020-09-17-hierarchy-pre-sept-2020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Let’s Encrypt’s hierarchy as of August 2020&quot; title=&quot;Let's Encrypt's hierarchy as of August 2020&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, we’ve issued two new 2048-bit RSA intermediates which we’re calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=183267&quot;&gt;R3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=183268&quot;&gt;R4&lt;/a&gt;. These are both issued by ISRG Root X1, and have 5-year lifetimes. They will also be cross-signed by IdenTrust. They’re basically direct replacements for our current X3 and X4, which are expiring in a year. We expect to switch our primary issuance pipeline to use R3 later this year, which won’t have any real effect on issuance or renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other new certificates are more interesting. First up, we have the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=183269&quot;&gt;ISRG Root X2&lt;/a&gt;, which has an ECDSA P-384 key instead of RSA, and is valid until 2040. Issued from that, we have two new intermediates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=183283&quot;&gt;E1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?caid=183284&quot;&gt;E2&lt;/a&gt;, which are both also ECDSA and are valid for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, these ECDSA intermediates are not cross-signed by IdenTrust’s DST Root CA X3. Instead, the ISRG Root X2 itself is &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?id=3334561878&quot;&gt;cross-signed by our existing ISRG Root X1&lt;/a&gt;. An astute observer might also notice that we have not issued an OCSP Signing Certificate from ISRG Root X2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/images/2020-09-17-hierarchy-post-sept-2020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Let’s Encrypt’s hierarchy as of September 2020&quot; title=&quot;Let's Encrypt's hierarchy as of September 2020&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the technical details out of the way, let’s dive in to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the new hierarchy looks the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/&quot;&gt;other articles&lt;/a&gt; you can read about the benefits of ECDSA (smaller key sizes for the same level of security; correspondingly faster encryption, decryption, signing, and verification operations; and more). But for us, the big benefit comes from their smaller certificate sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every connection to a remote domain over https:// requires a TLS handshake. Every TLS handshake requires that the server provide its certificate. Validating that certificate requires a certificate chain (the list of all intermediates up to but not including a trusted root), which is also usually provided by the server. This means that every connection – and a page covered in ads and tracking pixels might have dozens or hundreds – ends up transmitting a large amount of certificate data. And every certificate contains both its own public key and a signature provided by its issuer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a 2048-bit RSA public key is about 256 bytes long, an ECDSA P-384 public key is only about 48 bytes. Similarly, the RSA signature will be another 256 bytes, while the ECDSA signature will only be 96 bytes. Factoring in some additional overhead, that’s a savings of nearly 400 bytes per certificate. Multiply that by how many certificates are in your chain, and how many connections you get in a day, and the bandwidth savings add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These savings are a public benefit both for our subscribers – who can be sites for which bandwidth can be a meaningful cost every month – and for end-users, who may have limited or metered connections. Bringing privacy to the whole Web doesn’t just mean making certificates available, it means making them efficient, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside: since we’re concerned about certificate sizes, we’ve also taken a few other measures to save bytes in our new certificates. We’ve shortened their Subject Common Names from “Let’s Encrypt Authority X3” to just “R3”, relying on the previously-redundant Organization Name field to supply the words “Let’s Encrypt”. We’ve shortened their Authority Information Access Issuer and CRL Distribution Point URLs, and we’ve dropped their CPS and OCSP urls entirely. All of this adds up to another approximately 120 bytes of savings without making any substantive change to the useful information in the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-signing is an important step, bridging the gap between when a new root certificate is issued and when that root is incorporated into various trust stores. We know that it is going to take 5 years or so for our new ISRG Root X2 to be widely trusted itself, so in order for certificates issued by the E1 intermediate to be trusted, there needs to be a cross-sign somewhere in the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had basically two options: we could cross-sign the new ISRG Root X2 from our existing ISRG Root X1, or we could cross-sign the new E1 and E2 intermediates from ISRG Root X1. Let’s examine the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-signing the new ISRG Root X2 certificate means that, if a user has ISRG Root X2 in their trust store, then their full certificate chain will be 100% ECDSA, giving them fast validation, as discussed above. And over the next few years, as ISRG Root X2 is incorporated into more and more trust stores, validation of ECDSA end-entity certificates will get faster without users or websites having to change anything. The tradeoff though is that, as long as X2 isn’t in trust stores, user agents will have to validate a chain with two intermediates: both E1 and X2 chaining up to the X1 root. This takes more time during certificate validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-signing the intermediates directly has the opposite tradeoff. On the one hand, all of our chains will be the same length, with just one intermediate between the subscriber certificate and the widely-trusted ISRG Root X1. But on the other hand, when the ISRG Root X2 does become widely trusted, we’d have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2019/04/15/transitioning-to-isrg-root.html&quot;&gt;go through another chain switch&lt;/a&gt; in order for anyone to gain the benefits of an all-ECDSA chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we decided that providing the option of all-ECDSA chains was more important, and so opted to go with the first option, and cross-sign the ISRG Root X2 itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Online Certificate Status Protocol is a way for user agents to discover, in real time, whether or not a certificate they’re validating has been revoked. Whenever a browser wants to know if a certificate is still valid, it can simply hit a URL contained within the certificate itself and get a yes or no response, which is signed by another certificate and can be similarly validated. This is great for end-entity certificates, because the responses are small and fast, and any given user might care about (and therefore have to fetch) the validity of wildly different sets of certificates, depending on what sites they visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But intermediate certificates are a tiny subset of all certificates in the wild, are generally well-known, and are rarely revoked. Because of this, it can be much more efficient to simply maintain a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) containing validity information for all well-known intermediates. Our intermediate certificates all contain a URL from which a browser can fetch their CRL, and in fact some browsers even aggregate these into their own CRLs which they distribute with each update. This means that checking the revocation status of intermediates doesn’t require an extra network round trip before you can load a site, resulting in a better experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a recent change (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/2020/07/16/ballot-sc31-browser-alignment/&quot;&gt;ballot SC31&lt;/a&gt;) to the Baseline Requirements, which govern CAs, has made it so intermediate certificates are no longer required to include an OCSP URL; they can now have their revocation status served solely by CRL. And as noted above, we have removed the OCSP URL from our new intermediates. As a result, we didn’t need to issue an OCSP responder signed by ISRG Root X2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve shared our new certificates look the way they do, there’s one last thing we’d like to mention: how we actually went about issuing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of new root and intermediate certificates is a big deal, since their contents are so regulated and their private keys have to be so carefully protected. So much so that the act of issuing new ones is called a “ceremony”. Let’s Encrypt &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/about/&quot;&gt;believes strongly in automation&lt;/a&gt;, so we wanted our ceremony to require as little human involvement as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months we’ve built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/tree/main/cmd/ceremony&quot;&gt;ceremony tool&lt;/a&gt; which, given appropriate configuration, can produce all of the desired keys, certificates, and requests for cross-signs. We also built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/letsencrypt/2020-hierarchy-demo&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of our ceremony, showing what our configuration files would be, and allowing anyone to run it themselves and examine the resulting output. Our SREs put together a replica network, complete with Hardware Security Modules, and practiced the ceremony multiple times to ensure it would work flawlessly. We shared this demo with our technical advisory board, our community, and various mailing lists, and in the process received valuable feedback that actually influenced some of the decisions we’ve talked about above! Finally, on September 3rd, our Executive Director met with SREs at a secure datacenter to execute the whole ceremony, and record it for future audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the ceremony is complete. We’ve updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/certificates&quot;&gt;our certificates page&lt;/a&gt; to include details about all of our new certificates, and are beginning the process of requesting that our new root be incorporated into various trust stores. We intend to begin issuing with our new intermediates over the coming weeks, and will post further announcements in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;community forum&lt;/a&gt; when we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this has been an interesting and informative tour around our hierarchy, and we look forward to continuing to improve the internet one certificate at a time. We’d like to thank IdenTrust for their early and ongoing support of our vision to change security on the Web for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We depend on contributions from our community of users and supporters in order to provide our services. If your company or organization would like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/&quot;&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt; Let’s Encrypt please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;sponsor@letsencrypt.org&lt;/a&gt;. We ask that you make an &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/donate/&quot;&gt;individual contribution&lt;/a&gt; if it is within your means.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Not Rust?</title>
<link>https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using LLVM” is not a universal solution to all performance problems. While I am not aware of benchmarks comparing performance of C++ and Rust at scale, it’s not to hard to come up with a list of cases where Rust leaves some performance on the table relative to C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;12.842424242424&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest one is probably the fact that Rust’s move semantics is based on values (&lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; at the machine code level). In contrast, C++ semantics uses special references you can steal data from (pointers at the machine code level). In theory, compiler should be able to see through chain of copies; in practice it often doesn’t: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077&quot;&gt;#57077&lt;/a&gt;. A related problem is the absence of placement new — Rust sometimes need to copy bytes to/from the stack, while C++ can construct the thing in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;9.5774647887324&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat amusingly, Rust’s default ABI (which is not stable, to make it as efficient as possible) is sometimes worse than that of C: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26494#issuecomment-619506345&quot;&gt;#26494&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;10.671641791045&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while in theory Rust code should be more efficient due to the significantly richer aliasing information, enabling aliasing-related optimizations triggers LLVM bugs and miscompilations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878&quot;&gt;#54878&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;10.314606741573&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to reiterate, these are cherry-picked examples, sometimes the field is tilted the other way. For example, &lt;code&gt;std::unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHIkrotSwcc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1261&quot;&gt;has a performance problem&lt;/a&gt; which Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;11.14691943128&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potentially bigger issue is that Rust, with its definition time checked generics, is less expressive than C++. So, some C++ &lt;a href=&quot;http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Expression_templates&quot;&gt;template tricks&lt;/a&gt; for high performance are not expressible in Rust using a nice syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>We need physical audio kill switches</title>
<link>https://rubenerd.com/we-need-physical-audio-kill-switches/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rubenerd.com/we-need-physical-audio-kill-switches/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Update: I didn’t mention this concerned &lt;strong&gt;wired&lt;/strong&gt; headphones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aggressively disagree with any computer design decisions that detract from ergonomics or health, and nowhere does this continue to remain bafflingly true than audio output. Strap in, I’m about to get a bit ranty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we encounter an unwanted audio signal emanating from our computers, especially an uncomfortably-loud one over headphones, we should &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; be able to terminate it. No exceptions. If there is any latency &lt;em&gt;whatsoever&lt;/em&gt; between us hitting a mute button and the audio not cutting out, the hardware or software has failed. Crypton Future Media’s Hatsune Miku wouldn’t tolerate latency with her headphones, and neither should we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@1x.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/miku-headphones@2x.jpg 2x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a conference call last Friday where I’d adjusted the volume up to compensate for the client’s quiet microphone, only to be audibly shot in the ears by an auto-playing video on a website. There is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of problematic stuff to unpack there, much of which is not the fault of the audio hardware or OS. But shocked in the moment, I hit the mute button on my MacBook Pro Touchbar, and it took a solid two seconds for it to register. My ears were ringing throughout the whole call. &lt;em&gt;This is unacceptable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-engineered mute buttons on keyboards shouldn’t need to go to software, they should immediately send a signal to the motherboard’s DAC—ideally on a separate wire or connection—to say &lt;em&gt;terminate this signal&lt;/em&gt;. Then it’s less of a concern if it takes the OS a few seconds to react to the change, because our ears have been spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;just ackchyually&lt;/em&gt; crowd would don their Captain Obvious capes and brightly-coloured underwear to proclaim that people could &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; unplug their headphones, or rip them off ones head when suddenly inundated with loud audio. Sure, and if you start getting electric shocks from your keyboard you could &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; use an external one, bro. Or if you get your hand caught in a mixer, &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; use your other hand, that’s why you have two of them. There are so many reasons why this dismissive attitude is specious, but even if it weren’t, it would still take more physical effort &lt;em&gt;than a button&lt;/em&gt;. And if a mute button doesn’t fulfill the function for which it’s labelled and designed, what’s the point of it? But then, these people know all that, they’re just being obtuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have valid privacy arguments advocating for physical Wi-Fi, camera, and microphone buttons; I’d say audio should be voiced in these discussions too. They should be heard. Sound ideas should be reverberated. Miku.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FinCEN Files show trillions in tainted dollars flow freely through major banks</title>
<link>https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ecret U.S. government documents reveal that JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and other big banks have defied money laundering crackdowns by moving staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records show that five global banks — JPMorgan, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon — kept profiting from powerful and dangerous players even after U.S. authorities fined these financial institutions for earlier failures to stem flows of dirty money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. agencies responsible for enforcing money laundering laws rarely prosecute megabanks that break the law, and the actions authorities do take barely ripple the flood of plundered money that washes through the international financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases the banks kept moving illicit funds even after U.S. officials warned them they’d face criminal prosecutions if they didn’t stop doing business with mobsters, fraudsters or corrupt regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest bank based in the United States, moved money for people and companies tied to the massive looting of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Jho-Low&quot;&gt;public funds in Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, Venezuela and Ukraine, the leaked documents reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank moved more than $1 billion for the fugitive financier behind Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal, the records show, and more than $2 million for a young energy mogul’s company that has been accused of cheating Venezuela’s government and helping cause electrical blackouts that crippled large parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also processed more than $50 million in payments over a decade, the records show, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Paul-Manafort&quot;&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/a&gt;, the former campaign manager for President Donald Trump. The bank shuttled at least $6.9 million in Manafort transactions in the 14 months after he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-manafort-resigns-from-trump-campaign-227197&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the campaign amid a swirl of money laundering and corruption allegations spawning from his work with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tainted transactions continued to surge through accounts at JPMorgan despite the bank’s promises to improve its money laundering controls as part of settlements it reached with U.S. authorities in 2011, 2013 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this story, JPMorgan said it was legally prohibited from discussing clients or transactions. It said it has taken a “leadership role” in pursuing  “proactive intelligence-led investigations” and developing “innovative techniques to help combat financial crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon also continued to wave through suspect payments despite similar promises to government authorities, the secret documents show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked documents, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt;, include more than 2,100 suspicious activity reports filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fincen.gov/&quot;&gt;Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&lt;/a&gt;. The agency, known in shorthand as FinCEN, is an intelligence unit at the heart of the global system to fight money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/fincen-files&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt; obtained the records and shared them with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/&quot;&gt;International Consortium of Investigative Journalists&lt;/a&gt;. ICIJ organized a team of more than 400 journalists from 110 news organizations in 88 countries to investigate the world of banks and money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/mining-sars-data&quot;&gt;ICIJ analysis&lt;/a&gt; found, the documents identify more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity — including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/suspicious-activity-reports-explained/&quot;&gt;Suspicious activity reports&lt;/a&gt; reflect the concerns of watchdogs within banks and are not necessarily evidence of criminal conduct or other wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial institutions have abandoned their roles as front-line defenses against money laundering.&lt;/strong&gt; – Paul Pelletier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a vast amount, the $2 trillion in suspicious transactions identified within this set of documents is just a drop in a far larger flood of dirty money gushing through banks around the world.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt; represent less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million suspicious activity reports that financial institutions filed with FinCEN between 2011 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FinCEN and its parent, the Treasury Department, did not answer a series of questions sent last month by ICIJ and its partners. FinCEN told BuzzFeed News that it does not comment on the “existence or non-existence” of specific suspicious activity reports, sometimes known as SARs. Days before the release of the investigation by ICIJ and its partners, FinCEN &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-seeks-comments-enhancing-effectiveness-anti-money-laundering-programs&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was seeking public comments on ways to improve the U.S.’s anti-money laundering system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/suspicious-activity-reports-explained/&quot;&gt;suspicious activity reports&lt;/a&gt; — along with hundreds of spreadsheets filled with names, dates and figures — flag bank clients in more than 170 countries who were identified as being involved in potentially illicit transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with sifting through the FinCEN Files, ICIJ and its media partners obtained more than 17,600 other records from insiders and whistleblowers, court files, freedom-of-information requests and other sources. The team interviewed hundreds of people, including financial crime experts, law enforcement officials and crime victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;, some of the secret records were requested as part of U.S. congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Others were gathered by FinCEN following requests from law enforcement agencies, BuzzFeed said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FinCEN Files offer unprecedented insight into a secret world of international banking, anonymous clients and, in many cases, financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They show banks blindly moving cash through their accounts for people they can’t identify, failing to report transactions with all the hallmarks of money laundering until years after the fact, even doing business with clients enmeshed in financial frauds and public corruption scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S., who play a leading role in the global battle against money laundering, have ordered big banks to reform their practices, fined them hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars, and held threats of criminal charges over them as part of so-called deferred prosecution agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/about-the-fincen-files-investigation/&quot;&gt;16-month investigation&lt;/a&gt; by ICIJ and its reporting partners shows that these headline-making tactics haven’t worked. Big banks continue to play a central role in moving money tied to corruption, fraud, organized crime and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By utterly failing to prevent large-scale corrupt transactions, financial institutions have abandoned their roles as front-line defenses against money laundering,” Paul Pelletier, a former senior U.S. Justice Department official and financial crimes prosecutor, told ICIJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said banks know that “they operate in a system that is largely toothless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of the banks that appear most often in the FinCEN Files — Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon, Standard Chartered, JPMorgan and HSBC — repeatedly violated their official promises of good behavior, the secret records show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, London-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-ditry-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/a&gt;, the largest bank in Europe, signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/hsbc-holdings-plc-and-hsbc-bank-usa-na-admit-anti-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations&quot;&gt;deferred prosecution deal&lt;/a&gt; and admitted it had laundered at least $881 million for Latin American drug cartels. Narcotraffickers used specially shaped boxes that fit HSBC’s teller windows to drop off the huge amounts of drug money they were pushing through the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal with prosecutors, HSBC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-probe/hsbc-to-pay-1-9-billion-u-s-fine-in-money-laundering-case-idUSBRE8BA05M20121211&quot;&gt;paid $1.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; and the government agreed to put criminal charges against the bank on hold and dismiss them after five years if HSBC kept its pledge to aggressively fight the flow of dirty money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that five-year probationary period, the FinCEN Files show, HSBC continued to move money for questionable characters, including suspected Russian money launderers and a Ponzi scheme under investigation in multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the government allowed HSBC to announce in December 2017 that it had “lived up to all of its commitments” under its deferred prosecution pact — and that prosecutors were dismissing the criminal charges for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to ICIJ, HSBC declined to answer questions about specific customers or transactions. HSBC said ICIJ’s information is “historic and predates” the end of its five-year deferred prosecution deal.  During that time, the bank said, it “embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime. . . . HSBC is a much safer institution than it was in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC noted that in deciding to release the bank from the threat of criminal charges, the government had access to reports from a monitor who reviewed the bank’s reforms and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice declined to answer specific questions. In a statement, a spokesperson for the department’s criminal division said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Department of Justice stands by its work, and remains committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting financial crime — including money laundering — wherever we find it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-nav&quot;&gt;‘Everyone is doing badly’: Dirty money swamps bureaucrats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money laundering isn’t a victimless crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free flow of dirty cash helps sustain criminal gangs and destabilize nations. And it is a driver of global economic inequality. Laundered funds are often shunted between accounts owned by obscure shell companies registered in secretive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/&quot;&gt;offshore tax havens&lt;/a&gt;, allowing elites to hide massive sums from law enforcement and tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/mining-sars-data&quot;&gt;ICIJ analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that banks in the FinCEN files regularly processed transactions to companies registered in so-called secrecy jurisdictions and did so without knowing the ultimate owner of the account. At least 20% of the reports contained a client with an address in one of the world’s top offshore financial havens, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/tags/british-virgin-islands/&quot;&gt;British Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;, while many others provided addresses in the U.K., the U.S., Cyprus, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICIJ’s analysis found that in half of the reports banks didn’t have information about one or more entities behind the transactions. In 160 reports, banks sought more information about corporate vehicles, only to be met with no response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Studies/Illicit_financial_flows_2011_web.pdf&quot;&gt;United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime&lt;/a&gt; indicate that $2.4 trillion in illicit funds are laundered each year —  the equivalent of nearly 2.7% of all goods and services produced annually in the world.  But the agency estimates that authorities detect less than 1% of the world’s dirty money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/everyone-is-doing-badly-anti-money-laundering-czar-warns/&quot;&gt;Everyone is doing badly,&lt;/a&gt;” David Lewis, executive secretary of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, a partnership of governments around the world that sets anti-money laundering standards, acknowledged in an interview with ICIJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His organization’s country-evaluation reports — which dig into how well banks and government agencies meet anti-money-laundering laws and regulations — show lots of box-checking but little practical progress. Many countries seem more concerned with looking good on paper than actually cracking down on money laundering, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even an association of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/&quot;&gt;world’s biggest banks&lt;/a&gt; complained last year that regulators focus on “technical compliance” rather than whether systems “are really making a difference in the fight against financial crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Bombing in Jerusalem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some financial institutions, the problem client is another bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One early morning in 2003 Steven Averbach was on the No. 6 bus in Jerusalem, when a man rushed to board as the bus pulled away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were too many things out of place” with the man, recalled Averbach, who grew up in New Jersey but immigrated to Israel as a teenager. The man wore long black pants, a white shirt and a black jacket, the typical garb of an Orthodox Jew. But he wore “tipped shoes” that didn’t fit with the Orthodox sect dress, and his jacket was bulging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his right hand was a device that looked like a doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averbach, who had previously served as chief weapons instructor for the Jerusalem police force, drew his sidearm. But as the ex-cop turned to face the man, “he detonated himself,” Averbach later testified in a video deposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast killed seven and wounded 20 others, leaving Averbach paralyzed from the neck down. He died in 2010 of complications from the long-term effects of his injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, he and his family had become plaintiffs in a lawsuit in the U.S. accusing a Jordanian financial institution, Arab Bank, of moving funds that helped bankroll terrorists involved in the bus bombing and other attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FinCEN Files show that as the litigation was casting a shadow over Arab Bank, it was benefiting from a working relationship with a much bigger, more influential bank: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sc.com&quot;&gt;Standard Chartered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.-headquartered bank helped Arab Bank clients access the U.S. financial system after regulators found deficiencies in Arab Bank’s money laundering controls in 2005 and forced it to curtail its money-transfer activities in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered continued its relationship with Arab Bank as the lawsuit against the Jordanian bank worked its way through U.S. courts — and even after American authorities put Standard Chartered on notice that it must stop processing transactions for suspect clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York regulators concluded in 2012 that Standard Chartered had “schemed with the Government of Iran” for nearly a decade to push through $250 billion in secret transactions, reaping “hundreds of millions of dollars in fees” and leaving “the U.S. financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes.” This pattern of conduct cost Standard Chartered nearly $670 million in penalties in the second half of 2012 as part of two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/standard-chartered-bank-agrees-forfeit-227-million-illegal-transactions-iran-sudan-libya-and&quot;&gt;deferred prosecution agreements&lt;/a&gt; and other deals with New York and U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its official pledges to stay away from suspect customers, Standard Chartered processed 2,055 transactions totaling more than $24 million for Arab Bank customers between September 2013 and September 2014, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in late September 2014, Standard Chartered got another reason to back away from Arab Bank. In the lawsuit stemming from the 2003 Jerusalem bus bombing and other attacks, a jury in Brooklyn found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/nyregion/arab-bank-found-guilty-of-supporting-terrorist.html&quot;&gt;Arab Bank liable&lt;/a&gt; for knowingly supporting terrorism by transmitting money disguised as charitable donations for the benefit of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that the U.S. classifies as a terrorist organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a year later, compliance staffers at Standard Chartered sent FinCEN a suspicious activity report acknowledging the bank’s dealings with Arab Bank up to a few days after the verdict in Brooklyn and expressing concerns about “potential terrorist financing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered shifted nearly $12 million more in transactions for Arab Bank customers from just after the verdict until February 2016, according to a follow-up suspicious activity report included in the FinCEN Files. Many wires referred to “charities,” “donations,” “support” or “gifts,” the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-17655&quot; src=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Banks-TerroristFinancing-SAR.png&quot; alt=&quot;Arab Bank SAR from FinCEN Files&quot; width=&quot;1424&quot; height=&quot;763&quot; srcset=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Banks-TerroristFinancing-SAR.png 1424w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Banks-TerroristFinancing-SAR-760x407.png 760w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Banks-TerroristFinancing-SAR-1194x640.png 1194w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Banks-TerroristFinancing-SAR-768x412.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px&quot;/&gt; A snapshot from one suspicious activity report in the FinCEN Files that features Arab Bank.
&lt;p&gt;The follow-up report noted that the payment records raised concerns —  as in the Brooklyn trial — that “illicit activities” were being potentially  funded “under the guise of charity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil verdict against Arab Bank was overturned when an appeals court found flaws in the trial judge’s jury instructions. Arab Bank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arab-bank-decision/arab-bank-terrorism-case-ends-as-u-s-court-voids-jury-verdict-idUSKBN1FT26Z&quot;&gt;then settled&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 600 victims and victims’ relatives for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Arab Bank told ICIJ it “abhors terrorism and does not support or encourage terrorist activities.” The bank said that allegations against it date back nearly 20 years to a time when anti-money-laundering laws, tools and technologies were different than they are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In every country where it operates, Arab Bank is in good standing with government regulators and complies with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws,” the bank said.  The 2005 U.S. regulatory limits against the bank were formally lifted in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered told the BBC, a partner of ICIJ,  that it “initiated account closure” in connection to Arab Bank shortly after the jury verdict. “This process can take time in some cases,” the bank said, “but in all cases the bank continues to fulfil its regulatory obligations” while exiting accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arab Bank noted it “enjoys a longstanding relationship with Standard Chartered” that “continues today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered no longer processes U.S. dollar transactions for Arab Bank,  but it still provides other banking services for the Jordanian financial institution, Arab Bank told ICIJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why do banks move suspect money? Because it’s profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks can pad their bottom lines with the fees they collect as money spins through the webs of accounts often maintained by corrupt users of the financial system. JPMorgan, for example, scored an estimated half a billion dollars in revenues by serving as the chief banker to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madoff.com/document/dockets/001145-jpmorganbrief11-5044docket80.pdf&quot;&gt;Bernie Madoff&lt;/a&gt;, according to filings in the bankruptcy case spawned by the collapse of his multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with shady customers does carry risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid $88.3 million in 2011 to settle regulators’ claims that it had violated economic sanctions against Iran and other countries under U.S. embargoes. Treasury officials hit the bank with a “cease and desist” order in 2013 that described “systemic deficiencies” in its anti-money-laundering efforts, noting the bank had “failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in January 2014, the bank paid $2.6 billion to U.S. agencies to settle investigations over its role in Madoff’s scheme. JPMorgan posted profits of more than double that amount in just that quarter on its way to nearly $22 billion in profits for the year. Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan continued, after those enforcement actions, to move money for people involved in alleged financial crimes, the FinCEN Files show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Jho-Low&quot;&gt;Jho Low&lt;/a&gt;, a financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of being the mastermind behind the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. He moved just over $1.2 billion through JPMorgan from 2013 to 2016, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low first gained notoriety for partying with Paris Hilton, Leonardo DiCaprio and other celebrities. One night at a club on the French Riviera, he got into a bidding war over a cache of Cristal champagne — winning the contest with a final bid of 2 million euros, according to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/quartzy/1392005/malaysias-1mdb-scandal-the-hollywood-celebrities-connected-to-jho-low/&quot;&gt;Billion Dollar Whale&lt;/a&gt;,” a bestselling book about the 1MDB swindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was first outed by media reports in early 2015 as a key figure in the 1MDB scandal, the so-called “heist of the century.” Singapore issued a warrant for his arrest in April 2016. Authorities in the U.S., Malaysia and Singapore are seeking his capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also moved money for companies and people tied to corruption &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/How-banks-helped-Venezuelas-boligarchs-extract-billions&quot;&gt;scandals in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; that have helped create one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. One in three Venezuelans is not getting enough to eat, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1058051&quot;&gt;UN reported&lt;/a&gt; this year, and millions have fled the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Venezuelans who got help from JPMorgan was Alejandro “Piojo” Isturiz, a former government official who has been charged by U.S. authorities as a player in an international money laundering scheme. Prosecutors allege that between 2011 and 2013 Isturiz and others solicited bribes to rig government energy contracts. The bank moved more than $63 million for companies linked to Isturiz and the money laundering scheme between 2012 and 2016, the FinCEN Files show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isturiz could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret records show that JPMorgan also provided banking services to Derwick Associates, an energy firm that won billions of dollars in no-bid contracts to repair Venezuela’s failing electricity grid. A 2018 analysis by the Venezuelan chapter of the nonprofit group &lt;a href=&quot;https://transparencia.org.ve/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/EPE-II-Sector-Ele%CC%81ctrico.pdf&quot;&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Derwick Associates failed to deliver the power capacity expected — and overbilled the Venezuelan government by at least $2.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Betancourt was in his 20s when he co-founded Derwick with a younger cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News articles and Internet postings from 2011 raised allegations about Derwick. The company later filed a lawsuit that claimed it was the victim of a smear campaign that falsely accused it of being part of a “criminal group.” The suit was settled on undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FinCEN Files show that Derwick used accounts at JPMorgan to move at least  $2.1 million in 2011 and 2012 and that the bank processed other transactions of undisclosed amounts for Derwick and its managers at least into 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the U.S. Justice Department charged a senior Derwick executive, Francisco Convit Guruceaga, in an alleged $1.2 billion bribery and money-laundering scheme. Betancourt was cited in the criminal complaint as an unnamed co-conspirator, the Miami Herald, an ICIJ partner, later reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Betancourt said: “My client denies any wrongdoing.” Convit’s attorney declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a general statement, JPMorgan noted that it had acknowledged in 2014 that it needed to improve its anti-money-laundering controls and that since then it has invested heavily toward this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars are devoted to helping support law enforcement and national security efforts,” the bank said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‘Boss of bosses’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the secret files show, banks handling cross-border transactions have little idea who they’re dealing with — even when they’re shifting hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the case of a mysterious shell company called ABSI Enterprises. ABSI sent and received more than $1 billion in transactions through JPMorgan between January 2010 and July 2015, the FinCEN Files show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This amount included transactions through a direct bank account with JPMorgan, which ABSI closed in 2013, and through so-called correspondent banking arrangements, in which a bank with significant U.S. operations, such as JPMorgan, allows foreign banks to process U.S. dollar transactions through its own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance watchdogs based at the bank’s Columbus, Ohio, operations hub decided to try to figure out ABSI’s actual owner in 2015 after a Russian news site reported that a similarly-named shell company — which JPMorgan’s records indicated was the parent of ABSI — was linked to an underworld figure named Semion Mogilevich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogilevich has been described as the “Boss of Bosses” of Russia mafia groups. When the FBI put him on its Top Ten Most Wanted list in 2009, it said his criminal network was involved in weapons and drug trafficking, extortion and contract murders. The chain-smoking, beefy Ukrainian’s signature method of neutralizing an enemy, The Guardian once reported, is the car bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records show the compliance officers searched in vain through their files on the shell company, unable to determine who was behind the firm or what its true purpose was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those details still remain unclear, JPMorgan had plenty of reasons to examine ABSI years earlier: it operated as a shell company in Cyprus, considered a major money laundering center at the time, and it was directing hundreds of millions of dollars through JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogilevich is featured in “World’s Most Wanted,” a Netflix documentary series released in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a spokesperson, Mogilevich said he had no knowledge of ABSI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has previously said: “I am not a leader or an active participant of any criminal group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mighty dollar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News used the cache of suspicious activity reports in 2018 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/themoneytrail&quot;&gt;publish stories revealing secret payments&lt;/a&gt; to shell companies controlled by Manafort, who is now serving a federal prison sentence in home confinement in a case based largely on these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former U.S. Treasury Department official, Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to unlawfully disclose FinCEN documents to BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News has not commented on its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FinCEN and other U.S. agencies play an outsized role in anti-money-laundering efforts around the world, largely because money launderers and other criminals share the same goal as many bank customers who operate across borders: moving U.S. dollars, the de facto global currency, between account holders in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elite group of mostly U.S. and European banks with large operations in New York pocket fees for performing this trick, drawing on their privileged access to the U.S. Federal Reserve. These banks’ U.S. operations can also help turn local money into U.S. dollars, another key money laundering goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American law entrusts banks with frontline responsibility to prevent money laundering, even though their financial incentives run entirely in the direction of keeping money — dirty or clean — moving. While banks are empowered to stop a transaction if it appears to be shady, they’re not necessarily required to do so. They simply have to file a suspicious activity report with FinCEN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FinCEN, which has roughly 270 employees, collects and sifts through more than two million new suspicious activity reports each year from banks and other financial firms. It shares information with U.S. law enforcement agencies and with financial intelligence units in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long gone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside big banks, systems for sniffing out illicit cash flows rely on overworked, under-resourced staffers, who typically work in back offices far from headquarters and have little clout within their organizations. Documents in the FinCEN Files show compliance workers at major banks often resort to basic Google searches to try to learn who’s behind transfers involving hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the secret documents show, banks frequently file suspicious activity reports only after a transaction or customer becomes the subject of a negative news article or a government inquiry — usually after the money is long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interviews with ICIJ and BuzzFeed, more than a dozen former compliance officers at HSBC called into question the effectiveness of the bank’s anti-money-laundering programs. Some said the bank didn’t give them enough time to do much beyond cursory looks at large flows of cash — and that when they requested information about who was behind big transactions, HSBC branches outside the U.S. often ignored them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They would say: ‘Sure, we’ll get back to you.’ But they’d never get back,” recalls Alexis Grullon, who monitored international suspicious activity for HSBC in New York from 2012 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Standard Chartered Bank, a lawsuit filed in December 2019 in federal court in New York claims, employees who objected to illegal transactions weren’t ignored — they were threatened, harassed and fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian Knight and Anshuman Chandra claim in the suit that they were forced out of management jobs at the bank after it learned they had cooperated with an FBI probe into transfers of money that Standard Chartered had pushed through for U.S.-sanctioned entities from Iran, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered, the suit claims, engaged in a “highly sophisticated money laundering scheme,” altering the names of parties subject to U.S. sanctions on transaction documents and creating a technological workaround that allowed illegal transactions to slip through the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chandra, who worked in the bank’s Dubai branch from 2011 to 2016, concluded that the sanctions busting helped bankroll terror attacks “that killed and wounded soldiers serving in the U.S.-led coalition, as well as many innocent civilians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit says the scheme allowed the bank to profit from the “high premium” that Iran and its operatives were willing to pay to convert Iranian rials — the country’s sanctions-depressed currency — into dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can run a show like this probably for a few months without being caught if it’s a small group running it within the bank,” Chandra said in an interview with ICIJ partner BuzzFeed News. “But something like this happening over a period of years and coming into billions of dollars — someone at the top should have asked the question: How are we making this money?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chandra and Knight claim that the bank acknowledged only a fraction of its violations and lied about when illegal transactions had stopped when it came forward and admitted sanctions violations as part of its 2012 deferred prosecution deal with U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency extended the bank’s probationary period again and again over several years. Then, in 2019, the bank paid $1.1 billion more for continuing violations of sanctions against Iran and other countries and agreed to extend its deferred prosecution pact for two more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered didn’t answer questions from ICIJ and its partners about the ex-employees’ claims. In court papers, Standard Chartered said their allegations are implausible and meritless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-nav&quot;&gt;‘I am dying’: Ukraine, JPMorgan and the kleptocrats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one-year-old Olesia Zhukovska took a bullet in the fight against corruption in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d been working as a nurse in western Ukraine in late 2013 when protests broke out in the heart of Kyiv, the capital. During the regime of President Viktor Yanukovych, billions of dollars were being smuggled out of the country — channeled through far-off accounts at some of the world’s biggest banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrators protested their leaders’ tilt toward Russia and the high-level corruption that was wrecking the country’s economy, its schools, its health system. Ukrainians were dying, patient advocates said, because money intended for life-saving medicines and equipment was being stolen by insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhukovska says she couldn’t afford the $3,000 bribe it would take to get a job in an urban hospital. She worked instead at a rural health center with no heat, no medicines. “Nothing,” she says. The structure “looked like an old ruin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, she joined growing anti-government rallies in Kyiv, volunteering to treat demonstrators beaten by baton-swinging government forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was sorting bandages on Feb. 20, 2014, when a sniper’s bullet tore into her neck. It hit less than an inch, she says, from her carotid artery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an ambulance rushed her to the hospital, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OlesyaZhukovska/status/436436294483591168&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “I am dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-theme=&quot;dark&quot; readability=&quot;4.64&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;ru&quot;&gt;Я вмираю&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Olesya Zhukovskaya (@OlesyaZhukovska) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OlesyaZhukovska/status/436436294483591168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 20, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the day of what became known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266855828_The_Snipers'_Massacre_on_the_Maidan_in_Ukraine&quot;&gt;Snipers’ Massacre&lt;/a&gt;.” When the day ended, Zhukovska had survived, but dozens of others had been killed by rooftop police snipers who rained fire on protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhukovska’s tale of struggle and pain is similar to the stories of average people around the world who suffer as corrupt politicians and their cronies — in Ukraine and beyond — enrich themselves with the help of name-brand banks with global footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the young nurse was still healing in a hospital in early 2014, Yanukovych fled the country. So did his closest adviser, Chief of Staff &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Andriy-Klyuyev&quot;&gt;Andriy Klyuyev&lt;/a&gt;, who had emerged as a despised face of the crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ended up in exile in Russia. Both are wanted by Ukrainian authorities and under U.S. sanctions that accuse them of embezzling public funds and subverting Ukrainian democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation later found that a solar energy group run by Klyuyev’s family, Activ Solar, made off with hundreds of millions of dollars in what were purportedly loans from government-owned banks. Its assets were funneled into a network of offshore companies controlled by Klyuyev family members, according to a report by Ukraine’s Financial Intelligence Unit as part of a multinational investigation into the Yanukovych regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Activ Solar affair was part of an orgy of corruption under Yanukovych that included a network of companies linked to Klyuyev’s brother, Serhiy, buying Ukraine’s presidential palace, the Mezhyhirya estate, where Yanukovych lived, for a rock-bottom price. The palace — with a zoo complete with ostriches and a replica of a Spanish galleon for cruises on the Dnieper River — became a symbol of the regime’s decadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, corrupt proceeds need a place to hide. On the way, most pass through Lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lingerie and knee Boots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, the same time Yanukovych was winning the first round of Ukraine’s presidential election, someone incorporated a new company at the U.K.’s corporate registry, Companies House, a government office long criticized for granting legitimacy to companies with secret owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new company, NoviRex Sales LLP, claimed to be in the “domestic appliances” business, but its paperwork suggested something else was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It listed its official address as a small shop in Cardiff, Wales. Recently occupied by a nail salon, the same address was used by hundreds of other companies registered at Companies House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoviRex’s listed owners were two other companies, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-live.ch.gov.uk/docs/R3psDGkhCBfHCSfVOXkx0DIuGkVcZ_5wv_MqHgVckdc/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3CY766G4M%2F20200918%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20200918T201930Z&amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=60&amp;amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEBsaCWV1LXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDjS5izK4gW3nLLJd39sScpDu5gNRKHNDW2HSvO1cJejwIhAO%2FbO4QLXze4oHORLgr5S%2BLLmKakkWKP1Omee8cXV2J4KrQDCDQQAxoMNDQ5MjI5MDMyODIyIgwPaFukLMSoqVIQABwqkQO049IukQJB5SW2NSwLdOEtjOzfXM0vMKCKAkQPEdx6iZRjZnzyukTEUrMNDWwUEfttv%2FSEWP7UVNXXHD63IfmkaXerycfvAK7mXDZJfwktYrW6zv1bUwtoGbMJGxSWR7EsY8UYtb6vEG5%2FDbVMFrOTgkl%2FowByZGjGKkXwz2ios5KYUAjYNUP3f4fwz1WfdaBapN4Xckz9RBADHLh%2FZ2wNNC%2F4VNgkxK4l8GHg%2BtGLEb33sWtUuV1Sq5LLyLS3Hf3fLxGBcE4%2FHwAow7zGL39Dr%2F5mulmhYa0wGrd6%2Ft6lUdWEaOTQatAyTWrvMV8CMjmoQSvkuvLQpBGBOCkyuVR8aKOVjuNwMG1gRgbksVwPoI%2BQNVuuJiou1zxxM7E%2BiBA45oDaQgPAJgcq1GlZOGiAVlM%2Farazr%2FzD5obmfqZJ1rCPttxGavOVH6%2BgzrT3nCdhR5igMhO6AgFiZXOgehUu9V7DNta%2BLqgKfw12QU5ct2FCDvZ4GMeRHBBKts8erOjRJbrYK8wuhj1YNFZaF%2FJfpzDjgJT7BTrqAWxtI8Z%2F0x6svZVi5osd3scxkJTF%2B6WefJzBF%2F60ENsEA0XWkLmN%2B58mn2F6mJplWFIM9H2wTuIKieqPO4wUJ5vwvkqXvyE5RdX%2BZUehIdXHl4vRJytGT9Kkiwq64G0J5LnZXJTBfirQTm1jgwgMBl2ocw9v%2FopBCd2cN6DRFoekiNwqu6zkInZPdgD1iNKhY%2B8ffanVj74tHfj34OIcHbsEnJn47I9DJoOKBRRP40r0l%2F7V5bWyZU5LNS7Ieu388pNsokOZ15O6ZTTc2muMXEffV6X1hBg22kYVcw%2FvzpEub1gi86MZ0%2BDVLA%3D%3D&amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=d44ecae4fca1006559f7bdfb5b567062bd1c1baf0c68e2386514e32a44bd71ac&quot;&gt;incorporated in the British Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt; and also without visible owners. The same two BVI companies were listed as “owners” of thousands more companies at Companies House — many registered to the same shop in Cardiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records show that the two companies that owned NoviRex also owned companies linked in news reports to suspected bid-rigging and other corrupt acts, much of it centering on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt; show NoviRex soon began firing off payments of astonishing size and frequency. For a domestic appliances business, some of the reasons NoviRex gave for the payments were strange: $200,000 for “lingerie” from a British Virgin Islands company … $34,000 for “keyboard stickers” from a Hong Kong firm … almost $400,000 on “knee-boots” from another Hong Kong company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-17687&quot; src=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spreadsheet from FinCEN Files&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; srcset=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w-760x427.jpg 760w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w-1138x640.jpg 1138w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w-768x432.jpg 768w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Novirex-boots-1920w-1536x864.jpg 1536w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot;/&gt; A snapshot of a filtered sample of one spreadsheet found in the FinCEN Files featuring Noverix payments.
&lt;p&gt;Yet as NoviRex moved millions of dollars through the global banking system, its financial statements — available online from Companies House — indicated it was basically moribund, spending less than $2,500 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoviRex sent all its payments from banks in notorious money-laundering centers, including Latvia’s ABLV Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to move dollars internationally, NoviRex needed more than dodgy Latvian banks. It needed a global institution with access to accounts with the New York branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoviRex needed JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Middleman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With roots dating to American Revolutionary era figures Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the global banking behemoth provided ABLV with a U.S. dollar account in New York, allowing the Latvian bank to, in turn, offer dollar accounts to its own customers, including NoviRex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, even as banks faced new obligations under the 2001 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3162&quot;&gt;USA Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt; to carefully check out their foreign banking partners, JPMorgan ramped up business supplying U.S. dollar accounts to foreign banks. By 2003, it had become the global leader in “correspondent banking,” processing payments for the clients of 3,500 other banks around the world, helping bring JPMorgan’s overall daily dollar transaction volume to more than $2 trillion for clients in 46 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/sar_tti_07.pdf&quot;&gt;FinCEN issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; to global banks about Eastern European banks and their shell company customers, reporting that $4 billion in suspicious transactions had been reported since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the year Jamie Dimon was named JPMorgan’s chief executive, FinCEN warned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/explore-the-data/?country=LVA&quot;&gt;Latvian banks&lt;/a&gt; and their “sizable” non-Latvian customer base “continue to pose significant money laundering risks.” FinCEN said: “Many of Latvia’s institutions do not appear to serve the Latvian community, but instead serve suspect foreign private shell companies.” FinCEN said Latvia’s 23 banks then held about $5 billion in “nonresident” deposits, mainly from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/explore-the-data/?client=jp-morgan-chase-co&quot;&gt;JPMorgan’s market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In allowing a transfer, a correspondent bank (in a simple case) deducts the amount from the account of the sending bank and credits the account of the receiving bank, taking a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By granting foreign banks access to U.S. dollars, JPMorgan was opening the system’s doors to their customers, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/&quot;&gt;anonymous shell companies&lt;/a&gt; like NoviRex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return for this gatekeeping power, and the fees it brings, U.S. law requires JPMorgan and other banks like it to monitor each transaction cleared on foreign banks’ instructions — and to vet the foreign banks it does business with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/federal_register_notices/2018-02-16/2018-03214.pdf&quot;&gt;later probe&lt;/a&gt; would find that 90% of ABLV customers were deemed “high risk” by ABLV itself, primarily because they were shell companies registered in secrecy jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these shells were moving billions of dollars later traced to corruption in Ukraine. U.S. regulators concluded ABLV had institutionalized money laundering as “a pillar of the bank’s business practices,” aggressively peddled money laundering schemes to clients, and produced fraudulent documentation of “the highest quality” to support these schemes — all the while bribing Latvian officials to protect the bank from any threats to its business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two financial crime experts who reviewed NoviRex’s transactions at ICIJ’s request said the signs of money laundering were clear. NoviRex had behaved like no legitimate business ever would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I was at JPMorgan and I saw this, I’d be thinking: ‘This is horrendous,’ ” one of the experts, former U.K. police detective Martin Woods, said. “What normal company buys computers, lingerie and buckets?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By early 2014, as citizens were filling the streets to protest Yanukovych, Klyuyev and other government leaders, NoviRex had moved more than $188 million in transactions via JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pulling out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, meanwhile, was moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end 2014 it had terminated correspondent accounts of about 500 foreign banks, including, according to a Latvian banking trade group official, banks in Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a December 2014 report to shareholders, the bank acknowledged “mistakes made and lessons learned from our experiences in foreign correspondent banking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every company makes mistakes (and we’ve made a number of them), but the hallmark of a great company is what it does in response,” Dimon, the CEO, wrote in a cover letter.  He didn’t mention Ukraine or Latvia, or ABLV or NoviRex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did he mention that, shortly before the pullout, U.S. regulators had issued a scathing appraisal of JPMorgan’s money laundering safeguards and ordered the bank to review its correspondent banking practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, Ukraine’s treasury had been looted, JPMorgan’s fees pocketed. JPMorgan’s treasury-services group, the parent of its correspondent-banking business, reported $4.13 billion in revenue in 2013. Dimon’s total compensation in 2014 was $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NoviRex story might have ended there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, in November 2016, Donald Trump was elected America’s 45th president. Soon after, the U.S. Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russia’s election interference and other issues relating to Trump and his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those associates was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Paul-Manafort&quot;&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/a&gt;, onetime chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Death Penalty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manafort had also served as a consultant and lobbyist for Ukraine’s former president, Yanukovych. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt; show staff at JPMorgan’s Columbus, Ohio, compliance office became concerned about press reports from Ukraine of secret payments to Manafort-controlled shell companies disguised as payments for computer equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank noted that NoviRex had made such payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As scrutiny of Manafort’s foreign dealings intensified, the FinCEN Files show, JPMorgan filed more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/suspicious-activity-reports-explained/&quot;&gt;suspicious activity reports&lt;/a&gt; detailing — years after the fact — millions of dollars in payments to the consultant, his associates and their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Manafort’s 2018 trial, NoviRex’s name surfaced as one of a handful of shell companies used by Ukrainian oligarchs to channel payments for political lobbying work to Manafort’s own shell companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, NoviRex secretly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pressreader.com/ukraine/kyiv-post/20180810/281565176589037&quot;&gt;paid $4,190,111&lt;/a&gt; to Manafort’s consulting operation on behalf of Yanukovych’s Party of the Regions, according to government exhibits in his trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manafort was ultimately convicted of bank fraud, failure to report a foreign bank account and other crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one of Manafort’s trials, his former business partner, Rick Gates, finally revealed the person behind NoviRex: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Andriy-Klyuyev&quot;&gt;Klyuyev&lt;/a&gt;, Yanukovych’s right-hand man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The help that JPMorgan provided Klyuyev’s company never came up during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the FinCEN Files show, JPMorgan transmitted 706 transactions totaling at least $230 million for NoviRex from 2010 to 2015. Much of that amount went to companies incorporated in secretive tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, FinCEN declared JPMorgan’s former customer, ABLV, a “primary money laundering concern” that had moved “billions of dollars” for Ukrainian tycoons accused of looting state assets. FinCEN barred U.S. banks from providing ABLV access to U.S. correspondent accounts — a step known in financial circles as the “death penalty.” It is now in liquidation, and some of its bankers have been arrested by Latvian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from ICIJ, an ABLV spokesperson said that during the liquidation, an auditor is carrying out a review of the bank’s ex-clients and their transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: “We cannot publicly comment regarding any specific legal or natural persons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article-nav&quot;&gt;‘Tricks and cunning’: Big penalties don’t stop banks from moving dirty cash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money streamed in from California, Peru, Bolivia, China and other places where low-income families were willing to sink their modest savings — $2,000, $5,000, $10,000 — into an investment they hoped would change their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the click of a keyboard, investors’ money funneled through the New York operations of global banking giant HSBC.  Then it zipped across the world into accounts at HSBC’s sprawling Hong Kong offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like others taken in by what became known as the World Capital Market Ponzi scheme, Reynaldo Pacheco, a 44-year-old father in Santa Rosa, California, promoted the deal to family and acquaintances. When the WCM scheme began to unravel, one of the unlucky investors he’d encouraged to put money into the deal decided to have him killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three men kidnapped him and beat his head with rocks, leaving him dead in a creekbed, his hands tied behind his back with tape and one of his shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of victims lost an estimated $80 million in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FinCEN Files show that HSBC continued shifting money for the WCM investment fund at a time when authorities in three countries were investigating the company and the bank’s internal watchdogs knew it was an alleged Ponzi scheme. More than $30 million tied to WCM flowed through the bank in 2013 and 2014 — at a time when HSBC was under probation as part of its deferred prosecution deal with American authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after U.S. securities regulators won a restraining order freezing the company’s assets, WCM’s account at HSBC Hong Kong stayed active. According to court documents later filed by attorneys seeking money for the scheme’s victims, WCM drained more than $7 million from the account during the following week, drawing its balance to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WCM wasn’t the only company tied to criminal activities that moved money through HSBC during the five-year probation that came with the bank’s $1.9 billion deferred prosecution deal. The bank’s Hong Kong office, for example, processed more than $900 million in transactions involving shell companies linked in court records and media reports to alleged criminal networks, an ICIJ analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American prosecutors and other officials have praised deferred prosecution deals and other types of money laundering settlements as effective tools for making sure big banks follow the law and stop serving criminals. When authorities announced Standard Chartered’s deferred-prosecution deal in 2012, an FBI official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/standard-chartered-bank-agrees-forfeit-227-million-illegal-transactions-iran-sudan-libya-and&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;: “New York is a world financial capital and an international banking hub, and you have to play by the rules to conduct business here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICIJ’s investigation shows that five of the banks that appear most often in the FinCEN Files — HSBC, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and Bank of New York Mellon — continued moving cash for suspect people and companies in the wake of deferred prosecution agreements and other big money laundering enforcement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of those banks signed non-prosecution or deferred prosecution deals in the past 15 years relating to money laundering. The only bank of the five that hasn’t been the subject of a non- or deferred prosecution agreement is Deutsche Bank. Instead, it reached a $258 million civil settlement in 2015 in response to a probe by U.S. and New York banking regulators that found that the bank had moved billions of dollars on behalf of Iranian, Libyan, Syrian, Burmese and Sudanese financial institutions and other entities sanctioned by the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon was among the first big banks to pay a large penalty to U.S. authorities for anti-money-laundering failures. In 2005, two years before its merger with Mellon Financial, Bank of New York paid $38 million dollars and signed a non-prosecution agreement after a federal probe concluded that it had allowed $7 billion in illicit Russian money to flow through its accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media reports said investigators believed that Mogilevich, the alleged Russian mafia “Boss of Bosses,” was behind some of the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as it’s avoided big money laundering enforcement actions in recent years, Bank of New York Mellon has continued doing business with suspect figures, the FinCEN Files show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked records show, for example, that Bank of New York Mellon moved more than $1.3 billion in transactions between 1997 and 2016  tied to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=oleg-Deripaska&quot;&gt;Oleg Deripaska&lt;/a&gt;, a Russia billionaire and a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, Deripaska has been the subject of allegations in media reports tying him to organized crime. When U.S. authorities announced sanctions against him in 2018, they said he had been previously been accused of threatening the lives of corporate rivals, bribing a Russian government official and ordering the murder of a businessman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deripaska denies laundering funds or committing financial crimes. In 2019 the Trump administration lifted sanctions on three companies linked to him. U.S. sanctions on Deripaska himself remain and he’s suing in an effort to upend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BNY Mellon takes its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system seriously, including filing Suspicious Activity Reports,” the bank said in a statement. “As a trusted member of the international banking community, we fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and assist authorities in the important work they do.”&lt;/p&gt;

Banks continued to do business for Firtash amid these allegations.
&lt;h2&gt;Red flags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One striking pattern revealed by ICIJ’s analysis of the leaked records is the willingness of multiple banks to process transactions for the same risky clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deripaska, the Russian oligarch, didn’t just have Bank of New York Mellon helping him out. The secret records reveal Deutsche Bank shuffled more than $11 billion in transactions between 2003 and 2017 for companies he controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records also indicate that Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered helped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/bribery-division/bribery-division-what-is-odebrecht-who-is-involved/&quot;&gt;Odebrecht SA&lt;/a&gt; — a Latin American construction firm behind what U.S. prosecutors called the largest foreign bribery case in history — move $677 million from 2010 from 2016. Deutsche Bank played a role in transactions involving more than $560 million of that amount, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=Dmytro-Firtash&quot;&gt;Dmytro Firtash&lt;/a&gt;, a Ukrainian oligarch who is wanted on criminal charges in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, American prosecutors unsealed an indictment accusing him of bribing officials in India in an effort to secure a mining deal. Since late 2019, U.S. news outlets have reported on claims that Firtash played a role in President Trump’s effort to dig up dirt in Ukraine on his 2020 reelection opponent, Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firtash, who says he began his climb in business trading Ukrainian powdered milk for Uzbek cotton after the fall of the Soviet Union, lives in exile in a mansion in Vienna, protected so far from efforts to extradite him. His Art Nouveau villa has a home cinema and an infinity pool — a 2017 profile by Bloomberg Businessweek dubbed him “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-16/will-trump-rescue-the-oligarch-in-the-gilded-cage&quot;&gt;the Oligarch in the Gilded Cage.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to banking, he and companies tied to him found open doors among many of the industry’s big institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five big banks in ICIJ’s analysis — JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, HSBC and Bank of New York Mellon — handled transactions for companies controlled by Firtash, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/&quot;&gt;FinCEN Files&lt;/a&gt; show. And the records indicate that all five approved transactions tied to Firtash in the time periods after U.S. authorities had forced the banks to pay fines and pledge to work harder to vet suspect clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files show that among these banks, JPMorgan moved the most money for companies controlled by Firtash by far — shuffling hundreds of transactions totaling nearly $2 billion between 2003 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the other banks should have been aware of Firtash’s questionable history as far back as 2010, when a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable linked Firtash to Mogilevich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in 2011, a lawsuit filed in Manhattan by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko provided the banks even more of a heads up, even naming specific accounts at four of the banks that the suit alleged were being used by Firtash for money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit accused Firtash, Mogilevich and future Trump campaign manager Manafort of laundering illicit funds from Ukraine through banks and investment deals in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit claimed accounts at the New York offices of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and Bank of New York Mellon were being used in money laundering operations shifting money stolen in Ukraine to the U.S. and then — after it had been cleaned — round-tripping it back to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the allegations, these five banks continued to handle transactions involving companies controlled by Firtash, the FinCEN Files show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was dismissed in 2013, in part because Tymoshenko and her lawyers weren’t able to provide enough specifics of the transactions involved in the alleged scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firtash has denied wrongdoing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-16/will-trump-rescue-the-oligarch-in-the-gilded-cage&quot;&gt;telling Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; that he’s the victim of “a special machine of propaganda organized against me.” He told the magazine that Tymoshenko was “wrong in everything. She lies all the time. In order to money launder, you need to have dirty money to start with. I always had clean money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, an attorney for Firtash told ICIJ that Firtash “has never had any partnership or other commercial association with Semion Mogilevich.” The attorney said Firtash would not answer questions from ICIJ because its queries are “reliant on the unlawful and criminal disclosure” of suspicious activity reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holding bankers accountable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why haven’t seemingly big financial penalties done more to change banks’ behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Cassara, a financial crime expert who worked as a special agent assigned to FinCEN from 1996 to 2002, said that the size of the penalties paid by HSBC and other big banks may sound large but that they’re a tiny fraction of the banks’ profits. And the money isn’t paid by the bankers who should be held accountable, he said — it’s paid by shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank, received the biggest fine of all in 2014, when it was forced to pay $8.9 billion in the face of evidence that it helped shift billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Sudanese, Iranian and Cuban entities subject to American sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike settlements with HSBC and others, this wasn’t a deferred prosecution. The bank agreed to accept a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bnp-paribas-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-89-billion-illegally-processing-financial&quot;&gt;criminal conviction&lt;/a&gt;, and to force out 13 staffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the French bank, the priority in settlement negotiations was ensuring that its license to process dollar transactions in the U.S. wasn’t permanently taken away. Instead, U.S. regulators barred BNP Paribas from such activities for one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the deal was announced, the bank’s share price rose 4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James S. Henry, a New York-based economist, attorney and author who has been investigating the world of dirty money since the 1970s, says American enforcement actions over the past two decades have had some impact on large banks’ behavior — at least compared to an earlier era when they operated with almost no restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he said it’s going to take “more prosecutorial will and international collaboration” to truly change the relationship between banks and illicit cash flows. That includes holding banks as institutions — as well as top bankers themselves — accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to put some senior executives who are in charge of this stuff at risk,” Henry said. “And that means fines and/or jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shark tank&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded like something out of a spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank employees instructed clients from Iran and other hot spots to lace their payment messages with code words that would trigger special handling. One executive urged workers to employ “tricks and cunning” to avoid detection by American authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tricks of the trade were exposed in a November 2015 announcement by New York banking regulators. Deutsche Bank, state officials said, had been caught shifting nearly $11 billion between 1999 and 2006 on behalf of Iran, Syria and other countries under U.S. sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the $258 million settlement with the state and the Federal Reserve, Deutsche Bank agreed to reform its practices and fire employees involved in the sanctions-evasion operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-17795 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters-1138x640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ukrainian business tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky&quot; width=&quot;1138&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; srcset=&quot;https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters-1138x640.jpg 1138w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters-760x427.jpg 760w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters-768x432.jpg 768w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/Ihor_Kolomoisky_1920px-Reuters.jpg 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1138px) 100vw, 1138px&quot;/&gt; Ukrainian business tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky. &lt;span class=&quot;wp-caption-author&quot;&gt;Image: REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Deutsche Bank framed the deal as old news: “The conduct ceased several years ago, and since then we have terminated all business with parties from the countries involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month after the settlement was announced, the FinCEN Files show, Deutsche Bank was working behind the scenes to move money for a company linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/confidential-clients/#client=ihor-Kolomoisky&quot;&gt;Ihor Kolomoisky&lt;/a&gt; — a Ukrainian billionaire who, U.S. prosecutors later alleged, was engaged in a massive laundering scheme that funnelled cash into the American heartland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolomoisky has his own spy thriller mystique. U.S. prosecutors say he’s long been known for “ruthlessness and even violence” in business dealings, once hiring “armed goons” to take over the offices of a government-owned oil company. In an article in the Wall Street Journal, one associate recalled meeting with Kolomoisky and watching as the oligarch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-secret-weapon-feisty-oligarch-ihor-kolomoisky-1403886665&quot;&gt;pressed a remote-control switch&lt;/a&gt; that dropped crayfish meat to the hungry sharks occupying his office aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked records show Deutsche Bank moved $240 million from December 2015 to May 2016 for a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands that, U.S. court filings claim, was controlled by Kolomoisky and a business partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed last year in state court in Delaware alleges Kolomoisky used the shell company, Claresholm Marketing Ltd., to help pull off a “series of brazen fraudulent schemes” via PrivatBank, a Ukrainian institution that Kolomoisky and a partner controlled until the end of 2016. The new owners of the bank claim in the suit that Kolomoisky and his associates siphoned away billions of dollars from the bank through sham loans and then laundered the money through investments in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past July, New York regulators reached another money laundering settlement with Deutsche Bank. This time, the bank agreed to pay $150 million in penalties related to its dealings with convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein as well as with two non-U.S. banks involved in money laundering scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, U.S. prosecutors filed civil forfeiture complaints in federal court in Florida that included allegations of thievery and money laundering against Kolomoisky similar to the claims in the Delaware lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say much of the money allegedly stolen from PrivatBank between 2008 to 2016 ended up in investments in the U.S. — including commercial real estate in Texas and Ohio, steel plants in Kentucky, West Virginia and Michigan and a cellphone factory in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolomoisky did not respond to questions from ICIJ. A lawyer for him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-accuses-ukrainian-oligarch-of-stealing-billions-from-bank-he-once-owned-and-laundering-it-in-the-us/2020/08/06/b88924b8-d7f4-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_story.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in August: “Mr. Kolomoisky emphatically denies the allegations in the complaints filed by the Department of Justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the state court case in Delaware, lawyers for Kolomoisky’s businesses said the suit fails to show violations of racketeering statutes or other laws. Kolomoisky has also filed a defamation action against PrivatBank in Ukraine, claiming the bank has falsely accused him of fraud and other wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank declined to answer questions about its dealings with Kolomoisky, saying it was legally restricted from commenting on clients or transactions. The bank told ICIJ that it has acknowledged “past weaknesses” and “learnt from our mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said it has “systematically tackled” these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a different bank now,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Laid Off, Now What?</title>
<link>https://bharathpbhat.github.io/2020/09/19/laid-off-now-what.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bharathpbhat.github.io/2020/09/19/laid-off-now-what.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As an immigrant on an H1B, you have exactly 60 days to find a new job when you are laid-off. This is a very short window of time to explore and land any job, let alone a job that matches your skills and interests. I found myself in this situation along with many others when Uber announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262337/uber-layoff-3000-employees-covid-19-coronavirus&quot;&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. The following is a recollection of some things that worked well for me during my eventually successful job hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-be-prepping&quot;&gt;Always be prepping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding interviews are hard to crack if you haven't been prepping, so I was lucky that I had been spending roughly 3-4 hours every week on &lt;a href=&quot;http://leetcode.com&quot;&gt;leetcode&lt;/a&gt;, from about 2 months before the layoff rumours broke. I was lucky that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I knew that I wanted to change jobs in any case and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rumours of layoffs broke approximately a month before the actual layoffs happened, giving me more lead time to prepare and send out emails to recruiters and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever there's an economic downturn, I think it's critical to be acutely aware of what's happening at the company and start preparing for job interviews right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reach-out-to-everyone&quot;&gt;Reach out to everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things to do when you are laid off is to write to your friends and family seeking help. But if there's ever a time to swallow your pride, then this is it. I reached out to everyone I knew, and told them plainly about my situation, and asked to be recommended to specific roles at their companies, or to tell their friends who may be hiring. I am extremely grateful to the help I got from my network, and the kind messages that I received. So many friends wrote to make sure I was okay, and kept checking in throughout the interview process, and they all have my immense gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to just apply on the careers page when you find relevant roles at a company instead of spending time on finding connections and reaching out to them, but in my experience, it was very much worth it. Response times from recruiters was roughly 1-2 days when I was referred by an employee, whereas applying on the careers page was a hit or miss. One BigCo. took 40 days to respond, while some smaller companies were much quicker (3-4 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of companies, cast a wide net because you absolutely need &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; job before a deadline. The steps are the obvious ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a list of companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each company, compile a list of open job profiles that are relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email/Text a connection at the company, or apply on the careers page if all else fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I reached out to an initial list of 10 companies or so on the day news of the layoffs broke. This worked well because there's at least a week's time before you speak to a hiring manager or interviewer from when you reach out, so there's ample time to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What companies to reach out to? In my case, it was the usual suspects (FAANG), and then some domain specific ones such as autonomous vehicle companies. The two most common roles that I applied to were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a hybrid role with ML + Software Engineering skills needed, and job roles usually talk about some specific domain such as recommendation systems, or in the case of autonomous vehicles, things such as perception or object detection. I typically looked for some mention of Computer Vision, NLP and deep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning Infra Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; - This role tends to be more on the software systems side, and deals with the infra for training and serving ML models for production workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;interview-preparation&quot;&gt;Interview Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing for ML specific roles typically involves a few different kinds of interviews, each of which needs specific preparation. I'm outlining the most common ones I saw below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-initial-screen-with-the-hiring-manager&quot;&gt;An initial screen with the hiring manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that do general interviews (Google / Facebook) don't have this step, but most others do. I personally like this, because it means that you are interviewing for a specific position in a specific team, and there's a high level of engagement from the beginning. Most of these calls were about getting to know me, and making sure I have relevant work experience, while some of them also were rapid fire technical questions. The latter ones were rare, and I encountered them when the manager wasn't certain that I was the right person for the job. In my experience, the introduction is the most important part of this interview (&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about yourself&lt;/strong&gt;), and it helps to have prepared intros for each type of role that you are applying to. The idea is to tailor your story to highlight aspects of your work experience that are relevant to the job role. The next most important question is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;What would you like to do in your next role?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. Again, it helps immensely to be prepared to answer this question, and ideally, in a way so that there's reasonable overlap between your answer and what the role offers. Being able to answer this question also provides clarity to the job search process. For example, a consistent theme for me was to be (a) in an impactful / critical role for the company and (b) continue to work with the latest in ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and rehearsing your stories often seems unimportant when compared to more tangible preparation steps such as spending time on leetcode, but I believe that it was critical, because it sets the tone and gives you confidence that you have done this in the past, and done it well, and there's no reason for the interviewer to doubt your abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coding-interviews-phone--onsite&quot;&gt;Coding Interviews (Phone / Onsite)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the standard leetcode style coding interviews, done using coderpad, or some similar service. The template for these is consistent across all companies, and involves 1 or 2 coding questions (or 1 question with follow-ups) that you are expected to implement and test. Some tips that were helpful for me preparation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a premium subscription with leetcode&lt;/strong&gt; - It is nice to be able to filter by companies and have access to the entire question bank, and it is good karma. The service is valuable and the creators should be compensated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulate the interview setting as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt; - For example, I would set aside a 3 hour block of time for leetcode, shut myself in a room, and do 4 questions, 45 minutes each. If you are unable to solve a question in 45 minutes, you still move on to the next one. No extensions or looking at the solution. Think of it like moving on to the next interviewer. After the 3 hour session is done, go back to the questions as needed, either to look at solutions or to understand them better. A question is &lt;code&gt;Done&lt;/code&gt; when your solution passes all the tests on leetcode and is &lt;code&gt;Accepted&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk out loud&lt;/strong&gt; - This is big. Again, assuming that you are in an actual interview, talk out loud about the process you are using during these practice sessions. Talking out loud helps massively because you are forced to put your current train of thought into words, and it is often evident when a solution isn't justifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pick questions?&lt;/strong&gt; - I filtered for questions that were tagged &lt;code&gt;Hard&lt;/code&gt;, and then picked at random. No filter for company, or problem type. I went from doing all Mediums to a mix of Mediums and Hard to all Hards over a span of 4-5 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many questions to do?&lt;/strong&gt; - In the first 2-3 weeks of my prep, I was doing 4 questions on one of the weekend days, and once I had more time post the lay-off news, it was 4 questions every 3 days or so. Overall, my stats look so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/images/leetcode_xp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Leetcode stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;machine-learning-interviews&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These typically come in two flavors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;concepts--basics&quot;&gt;Concepts / Basics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are kind of like rapid fire questions where the interviewer will quiz you about ML basics. Some questions that I recall right now, to give a flavor of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;- What are some unsupervised learning methods?
- What is underfitting / overfitting?
- What is batch normalization? What's the motivation behind it?
- What is dropout? 
- What optimizers have you used? And typically some follow-up like, why does momentum make sense?
- What are some object detection techniques / papers that you are familiar with? (Computer Vision specific)
- What are decision trees? 
- How does logistic regression work?
- How do you train a linear regression model?
- What are some loss functions that you are familiar with?
- Why does Cross Entropy loss make sense?
- What are residual networks?
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are usually follow up questions where the interviewer will try to dig deeper into these concepts, often picking on some portion of the initial answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of reading, and then some writing with a pen and paper for this part of the interview. If I am already somewhat/fairly familiar with a topic, like say, object detection, then my process was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write&lt;/strong&gt; from memory a summary of what I remember about the topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note down &lt;strong&gt;questions&lt;/strong&gt; for the parts that I am not clear about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; about the topic, and fill in whatever I missed on first go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I don't remember much about a topic at all, like say, multi-armed bandits, then I would do step (3) first, and then do steps (1) and (2) a few days later, and eventually repeating step (3) as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to start with a list of topics that you want do this for. This list will grow as you remember more topics or expand the list of companies you are interviewing at. For reference, the list of topics I looked at is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/files/index_card.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a sample of the handwritten notes I made is here, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/files/rec_sys.pdf&quot;&gt;recommendation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;ml-system-design&quot;&gt;ML System Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite interview, and corresponds neatly to skills used day to day as a ML practitioner. These are typically open ended interviews where the candidate is expected to design a product with some ML at its core. For example, things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;- Let's build a model that ranks photos in your photo library based on quality.
- How would you build a model that identifies pedestrians from drone imagery?
- Let's build a model that can does face detection for a user's photo library.
- How do you build a model that automatically picks out thumbnails from videos?
- Building some sort of recommendation system.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact nature of the question and the technologies involved, like Computer Vision or NLP or recommendation systems, depends on the company and the team that you are interviewing for. People generally tend to ask questions on systems that they work on day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any system design question, it's useful to draw out the major components first, and then go into the details. Something like this (thanks to my wife for helping with this):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bharathpbhat.github.io/assets/images/ml_system_design.svg&quot; alt=&quot;ML System Design&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the major components, you need to cover minimally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Formulation&lt;/strong&gt; - How do you formulate the problem? What are the inputs / outputs to the model you are considering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt; - How do you collect the data needed to train this model? User actions, expert annotations...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Training&lt;/strong&gt; - Specifics on model training. What kind of model, loss functions, evaulation metrics and such&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Serving&lt;/strong&gt; - How will the model be deployed? Is it something on device? How many QPS do we need to support? Or are the model predictions computed in a batch offline? Is there versioning involved? Questions of large scale system design are talked about here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt; - What metrics would need to be collected? How do we keep the model up to date as time goes on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to prepare for these interviews is to go through mock practice interview sessions with a friend/co-worker/spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;behavioral-interviews&quot;&gt;Behavioral Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a more involved or extended version of the initial phone screen with the hiring manager. This is typically where you are expected to talk about how your past experiences have shaped your thought processes and made you a better person (hopefully). The exact format of this interview is variable, but each company typically has a list of core values or competencies they look for, like for example, communication. They have a few different questions for each competency. For example, something like &quot;tell me about a time when you had to convince your team members about a design choice you made&quot;. I prepared for these interviews by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List Successes&lt;/strong&gt; - Write down a list of successful projects and situations from you past that you think you had handled well. Go exhaustive - and try to get to 5-10 situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story Writing&lt;/strong&gt; - For each of these, write how you want the story to be told. This is critical, because you'll likely not do the situation any justice if you are talking about it for the first time during the interview. You have to remember that the interviewer knows absolutely nothing about your situation, and hence spending time on setting up context is important. You should then clearly articulate what the challenges were, and how you handled it, and your takeaways. This process gets easier if you write about successful projects when the memory is fresh in your mind. You'll always need to recap your success stories, for the next job or to get a raise. So spending a few hours at the end of a successful project to write a retrospective is a huge force multiplier, and you'll come back to refer to this document often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map to Competencies&lt;/strong&gt; - Before you interview at a company, look at the values / competencies they look for, and map each of them to some story from step (1). This will be a many-to-many map, so you'll have backups, and you can pick a story during the interview to optimize for impact and diversity of stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rehearse&lt;/strong&gt; - Do practice interviews with a friend/co-worker/spouse and rehearse your stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the interview, always take some time to think about how you would modify your story so that it answers the question asked by the interviewer. Don't jump into story-telling. Collect your thoughts first. As you tell your story, make it easy for the interviewer to make their notes by mentioning proxy terms for the skill they are currently testing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I made some private notes on how I ended up in a situation where I got laid off, and some thoughts on avoiding similar pitfalls in the future are noted here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always ask: Is the work that I am going to be doing in this team critical to the product/business? Note that in the case of larger companies, you should try to understand if the product or business that the team supports is large enough. The hiring manager should be able to clearly and succintly articulate the team's mission. There should be well defined examples of past projects and future milestones that relate to company priorities. For ongoing/future projects, how would stakeholders adopt if this team were to stop existing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are joining a research team, the company should be profitable enough and have enough cash to support research activities for the long term, or if not, the research being done has to be critical to the company's mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you decide to start interviewing for jobs, &lt;strong&gt;always always&lt;/strong&gt; talk to multiple companies - it is definitely painful to manage and prepare for multiple interviews, but you need to be able to walk away from a sub-optimal offer, and you can only do that when there are multiple offers or promising processes in the pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>Laid off, now what?</og:title>
<og:description>As an immigrant on an H1B, you have exactly 60 days to find a new job when you are laid-off. This is a very short window of time to explore and land any job, let alone a job that matches your skills and interests. I found myself in this situation along with many others when Uber announced layoffs earlier this year. The following is a recollection of some things that worked well for me during my eventually successful job hunt.</og:description>

<title>Dream Vendor &quot;Canna_Bars&quot; Sentenced to Prison</title>
<link>https://darknetlive.com/post/dream-vendor-canna-bars-sentenced-to-prison/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://darknetlive.com/post/dream-vendor-canna-bars-sentenced-to-prison/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A judge in a California court &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/9BM4V&quot; title=&quot;Sacramento Man Sentenced to over 5 Years in Prison for Distributing Narcotics on the Dark Web and Illegally Possessing Firearms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;sentenced Jose Robert Porras III&lt;/a&gt; to five years and 10 months in federal prison for distributing a controlled substance and illegally possessing firearms. The Northern California Illicit Digital Economy Task Force (NCIDE) investigated Porras in 2018 and identified him as the operator of vendor accounts on Hansa Market, Wall Street Market, and Dream Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;a1b&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aq&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/images/porras-weed.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/post/canna-bars-aka-thefastplug-pleads-guilty-to-drug-distribution-charges/&quot; title=&quot;Canna_Bars aka TheFastPlug Pleads Guilty to Drug Distribution Charges&quot;&gt;Porras pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to a controlled substance distribution charge and one firearm possession charge. Porras originally faced a much longer prison sentence; a grand jury in the Eastern District of California returned a 16-count indictment against Porras and his co-defendant, Pasia Vue. The indictment included additional controlled substance distribution charges, conspiracy distribution charges, money laundering charges, money laundering conspiracy charges, and one illegal firearm possession charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;guilty-plea&quot;&gt;Guilty Plea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the plea agreement, Porras agreed that if the case went to trial, the United States could prove that he had been selling marijuana and Xanax on Wall Street Market and Dream Market. His operation began in early 2017 and continued until his arrest in early 2018. Porras admitted that he had distributed at least 53 kilograms of marijuana though his vendor account on Dream Market between the dates listed in the plea agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admitted creating and using the a vendor account under the username “The Fast Plug” on Wall Street Market and “Canna_Bars” on Dream Market. Although other court documents referenced his use of the Canna_Bars account on Hansa Market, his guilty plea contained no mention of the account or marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porras also admitted possessing a Model A uzi-style pistol; a MAK 90; and an S&amp;amp;W .44 caliber revolver. Although all weapons in Porras’ possession were legal firearms (the uzi-style pistol used post ban parts), a felony conviction for possession with intent precluded firearm ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 16, 2019, United States District Court Judge Kimberly Mueller sentenced Porras to five years and 10 months in federal prison. The judge dismissed all but the charges listed in the plea agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;investigation&quot;&gt;Investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law enforcement investigated Porras as a part of Operation Dark Gold, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190628014333/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-nationwide-undercover-operation-targeting-darknet-vendors-results-arrests-more-35&quot; title=&quot;First Nationwide Undercover Operation Targeting Darknet Vendors Results in Arrests of More Than 35 Individuals Selling Illicit Goods and the Seizure of Weapons, Drugs and More Than $23.6 Million&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;a Department of Justice press release from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Dark Gold was a “coordinated national operation that used the first nationwide undercover action” to target darkweb vendors. The operation involved a multitude of federal agencies and lasted one year in total. At the date of the Dark Gold announcement, the investigation had resulted in the arrest of 35 darkweb vendors and their co-conspirators and the seizure of more than $35 million in cash and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details on how the investigation into Porras began are unknown to general public. Entire sections of the criminal complaint are redacted. Parts of the criminal complaint that detail the actual investigation are similarly impossible to read. We know, thanks to documents from other Operation Dark Gold cases, that Porras had used a money laundering service controlled by Homeland Security Investigations. Vendors sent the money launderer a certain amount of Bitcoin and the money launderer mailed cash back to the vendor. At some point in the money launderer’s career, federal agents quietly took control of the money laundering operation and used the position to identify dozens of darkweb vendors. Public information about the money laundering operation is almost non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;a1b&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aq&quot; data-size=&quot;600x315&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/images/fact-redacted-porras.png&quot; alt=&quot;Redacted Section of the Criminal Complaint&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redacted Section of the Criminal Complaint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the available sections of the document provide evidence reinforcing the link between Porras and the vendor accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the Dream Marketplace, I located a vendor using the identity canna_bars. Canna_Bars registered their account on the Dream Marketplace on July 20, 2017, and offered various quantities of “og kush” marijuana for sale,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Aron Mann wrote at the beginning of a section of the criminal complaint detailing the investigation. While examining the profile on Dream Market, SA Mann noticed the vendor had a verified rating from Hansa Market on the profile. Dutch law enforcement had shut down Hansa Market in July 2017 but the seized data is still available to law enforcement agencies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Feburary 2018, SA Mann requested any available data on the Canna_Bars account on Hansa Market from the Homeland Security Investigations field office in the Netherlands. The Netherlands field office, after gathering the requested data, the sent a copy to SA Mann. The Special Agent reviewed the profile and highlighted elements relevant to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;meth-from-mexico&quot;&gt;Meth from Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SA Mann included the description of a methamphetamine listing on Hansa Market in the criminal complaint. Canna_Bars, on Hansa, advertised pounds of methamphetamine. In the description of the product, Porras had claimed the methamphetamine came “direct from Mexico.” The Special Agent also pointed out that Porras had also misspelled the word “quality” in the description on a listing for marijuana on Dream Market. He provided copies of description on the Dream Market vendor account operated by Porras that contained identical misspellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;a1b&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aq&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/images/wsm-porras.png&quot; alt=&quot;Porras Made the Same Mistake on Wallstreet Market&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porras Made the Same Mistake on Wallstreet Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porras identified himself as a target of &lt;a href=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/post/us-law-enforcement-published-a-tor-site-with-busted-vendor-list/&quot; title=&quot;U.S. Police Launch their Own Tor Site for Darkweb Vendor Busts&quot;&gt;the Northern California Illicit Digital Economy Task Force&lt;/a&gt; in the same listing on Dream Market. He wrote,“whats up we are Canna_Bars a vendor of top qaulity weed we offer qps to multiple pounds we are &lt;strong&gt;operating out of northern california&lt;/strong&gt; and have direct relationships with many growers so expect good qaulity for cheap prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imgur-fingerprints&quot;&gt;Imgur Fingerprints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, while reviewing the data from Hansa Market, SA Mann found a link to an Imgur album containing high resolution pictures of marijuana. Porras provided a potential customer with the album in response to a request for additional pictures of the marijuana Porras had listed on Hansa. The imgur album appears to be this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190618152133/https://imgur.com/a/uy7PY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;imgur.com/a/uy7PY&lt;/a&gt;. The pictures included closeup pictures of Porras’ hand with visible fingerprint ridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;a1b&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aq&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/images/porras-prints.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Visible Fingerprints in a Picture Posted by Porras&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visible Fingerprints in a Picture Posted by Porras&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Agent sent the highest resolution picture to the HSI Forensic Document Laboratory and requested an analysis of the prints. The FDL returned the request after conducting a comparative analysis of the friction ridge detail of the fingerprints from the Imgur album and the fingerprint samples taken after police had arrested Porras for a different crime. The fingerprints in the Imgur album matched the prints they already had on file for Porras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;undercover-purchases&quot;&gt;Undercover Purchases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement made a number of controlled purchases during the investigation into Porras and his co-conspirators. The purchases and subsequent surveillance followed the same pattern every time: make a purchase; watch Porras drive to a storage facility where he stored product; follow Porras to the Post Office; talk to Postal Inspectors about the package Porras or his co-conspirator had dropped into a USPS Blue Box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2018, a USPIS Inspector and I placed an undercover purchase for two pounds of “Double Og Kush” marijuana from CANNA_BARS on the Dream Marketplace. With the order, I sent a PGP encrypted message requesting the parcel be sent to an undercover PO Box controlled by USPIS in another State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 7, 2018, law enforcement established surveillance around the SUBJECT PREMISES after confirming that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was at the residence. At approximately 1038 hours, law enforcement observed PORRAS and VUE leaving in the SUBJECT VEHICLE at which time mobile surveillance was established. Law enforcement followed the SUBJECT VEHICLE to the STORAGE UNIT where PORRAS and VUE remained for approximately 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the U.S. Post Office, both PORRAS and VUE exited the SUBJECT VEHICLE, looked around to observe their surroundings, and retrieved three parcels from the trunk of the SUBJECT VEHICLE. Both PORRAS and VUE entered the Post Office and dropped off the three parcels at three different locations to be placed in the mail stream for delivery. At this point a waiting USPIS Inspector retrieved the three parcels for inspection. PORRAS and VUE left the post office separately and returned to the SUBJECT VEHICLE and departed the area at approximately 1440 hours. At this time law enforcement terminated surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case eventually ended with a 16-count indictment and the arrest of Porras and his primary co-conspirator, Passia Vue.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep Github issues for actual bugs. User support is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uMatrix/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/r/uMatrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forked and refactored from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard&quot;&gt;HTTP Switchboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/blob/master/doc/README.md&quot;&gt;manually&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt;, or install from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may contribute with translation work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki&quot;&gt;HTTP Switchboard's documentation&lt;/a&gt; is still relevant, except for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Changes-from-HTTP-Switchboard&quot;&gt;uMatrix's differences with HTTP Switchboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may contribute with documentation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki&quot;&gt;uMatrix's wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Regarding broken sites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uMatrix does not guarantee that sites will work fine: it is for advanced users who can figure how to un-break sites, because essentially uMatrix is a firewall which works in relaxed block-all/allow-exceptionally mode out of the box: it is not unexpected that sites will break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this means do not file issues to report broken sites when the sites are broken because uMatrix does its job as expected.&lt;/strong&gt; I will close any such issue without further comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using uMatrix logger is key to un-break sites:&lt;/strong&gt; the logger will show you all that uMatrix does internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect there will be community driven efforts for users to help each others. If uMatrix had a home, I would probably set up a forum, but I do not plan for such thing, I really just want to code, not manage web sites. If you need help to un-break a site when using uMatrix, you can try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/umatrix-the-http-switchboard-successor.369601/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wilders Security&lt;/a&gt;, where you are likely to receive help if needed, whether by me or other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uMatrix can be set to work in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views#the-allow-allblock-exceptionally-approach&quot;&gt;allow-all/block-exceptionally&lt;/a&gt; mode with a single click on the &lt;code&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; cell in the global scope &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, if you prefer to work this way. This will of course break less sites, but you would then lose all the benefits which comes with block-all/allow-exceptionally mode -- though you will still benefit from the 62,000+ blacklisted hostnames by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;33.393961440524&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Originally posted by OrdaGarb on April 26th, 2015...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have a slight fascination with sweeteners. About five years ago I imported a kilo of &quot;Neotame&quot; sweetener from a chem factory in Shanghai. It was claimed to be 10,000-12,000 times sweeter than sugar. It's a white powder and came in a metal can with a crimped lid and typically plain chemical labeling. Supposedly it is FDA-approved and a distant derivative of aspartame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;US customs held it for two weeks before sending it on to Colorado with no explanation. When received, the box was covered in &quot;inspected&quot; tape and they had put the canister in a clear plastic bag. The crimped lid looked like a rottweiler chewed it open and white powder was all over the inside of the bag. I unwisely opened this in my kitchen with no respirator as advised by the MSDS which I read after the fact (I am not a smart man).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Despite careful handling of the bag, it is so fine in composition that a small cloud of powder erupted in front of me and a hazy layer of the stuff settled over the kitchen. Eyes burning and some mild choking from inhaling the cloud, I instantly marveled at how unbelievably sweet the air tasted, and it was delicious. For several hours I could still taste it on my lips. The poor customs inspector will have had a lasting memory of that container I'm pretty sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Even after a thorough wipe-down, to this day I encounter items in my kitchen with visually imperceptible amounts of residue. After touching it and getting even microscopic quantities of the stuff on a utensil or cup, bowl, plate, whatever, it adds an intense element of sweetness to the food being prepared, sometimes to our delight. I still have more than 900g even after giving away multiple baggies to friends and family (with proper safety precautions).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;We have been hooked on it since that first encounter. I keep a 100mL bottle of solution in the fridge which is used to fill smaller dropper bottles. I've prepared that 100mL bottle three times over five years, and that works out to about 12g of personal (somewhat heavy) usage for two people in that time. Probably nowhere near the LD50.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I carry a tiny 30mL dropper bottle of the solution for sweetening the nasty office coffee and anything else as appropriate. Four drops to a normal cup of coffee. We sweeten home-carbonated beverages, oatmeal, baked goods (it is heat stable), use it in marinades, and countless other applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't know if it's safe. The actual quantity used is so incredibly tiny that it seems irrelevant. I'd sweeten my coffee with polonium-210 if it could be done in Neotame-like quantities. Between this, a salt shaker loaded with MSG and a Darwin fish on my car, I'm doomed anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;34.301675977654&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;From Nostrademons:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;I predict that Libra will work for a while, but will eventually be overshadowed either by competitors or by the new markets that it enables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There's this pattern I've noticed where every major tech company, once initial traction has been established, gets three pivots. You can think of them as adolescence, mid-life, and rebirth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The first pivot happens when the company is 5-8 years old (since the 1970s at least; older before then), and serves to define the company. The System 360 for IBM, defining it as the provider of mainframes for enterprises. MS-DOS for Microsoft, defining it as the dominant PC OS. The Macintosh for Apple, defining it as the most user-friendly consumer brand out there. GMail and Maps for Google, defining it as the conglomerate of the Internet age. Mobile for Facebook, defining it as the service that connects people regardless of where they are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The second pivot happens when the company is 10-15, at the height of its dominance, and usually results from it entering the hottest new technology wave with a vengeance. It looks like it succeeds for a while, crushes early entrants, serves to legitimize that technology wave, but ultimately peters out as the company can't keep up with the changes that it introduces. The IBM PC for IBM, which legitimized the PC market but ultimately fell to clones. Internet Explorer for Microsoft, which legitimized the Internet but ultimately was eclipsed by Google's many products. The Newton for Apple, which legitimized the PDA market but ultimately was too early. Google+ for Google, which legitimized social networking but ultimately failed to gain traction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The third pivot is when the company realizes that they basically incapable of innovating, and returns to the roots they established with the first pivot to live out their old age. Open-source consulting for IBM, leveraging their massive installed base of enterprise customers. VS Code, XBox, and Azure for Microsoft, recognizing that they are fundamentally a platforms company. The iPhone and iPad for Apple, refocusing on their strengths in UX and delivering top-quality consumer electronics products. Alphabet for Google, realizing that they're fundamentally a conglomerate that lets a thousand flowers bloom (and cancels 990 of them).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Libra is Facebook's second pivot. It'll look like it succeeds for a while, it'll legitimize cryptocurrency, but it'll ultimately end up eclipsed by what it creates. &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;39.57486631016&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This one about whether designers are crazy because the OP didn't understand why designers would care about minute details in their work. It is because attention to detail creates superlative work. It is similar to why premature optimization isn't &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; bad for engineers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5002262&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5002262&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;No, designers aren't crazy. You just don't understand a very fundamental concept of design. It even applies to engineering. It's okay—many people have the same frustrations as you do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But those who care about the details achieve truly high quality results overall. It extends to all areas of the design, not just to the parts you can't see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In the movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit,&quot; there's a scene in a dark room where Roger Rabbit (an animated character) flies across the room, knocks a hanging lamp around, and the lighting becomes so dynamic that all the shadows move around including the animated character's shadow. Here's the scene in question: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This was such a small detail that it would have been forgivable if the animators had left it out entirely: if they had not moved the lamp, kept the shadow steady, no one would have really noticed the difference. It would have been 100 times easier to animate and the effect wouldn't really have been that different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But they did it anyway. The term was later coined, and &quot;bump the lamp&quot; is used throughout Disney (and probably other organizations) to mean something akin to &quot;go the extra mile&quot;—but I see it as having a special significance to design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You're right, most people won't notice. By that logic, you could cut corners a lot of other places too. You could be lax about button colors matching exactly, or per-pixel sharpness on the map and buttons. No one would probably notice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But if you go for every detail like it was the most important detail, you have the possibility of reaching a level of design quality that is superlative, and some people will notice. Others will not notice directly, but will see that the piece exudes style and quality subconsciously, due to the attention to small details. If you carry this into other areas of your work—programming, customer service, market strategy, marketing, and more—then you have a chance to create something of true quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you don't pay attention to detail at that level, well, you might have the chance to actually get something done. Yes, it's a balance, like everything else. But you have to know that it won't be quite as good, and understand that yes, you are sacrificing something, even if you can't see it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; fiaz MANY days ago | parent | favorite | on: Ask News.YC: How to re-motivate yourself?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; APOLOGIES for making this post so annoyingly long, but I really hope you find value in the words below. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm going to first share a personal experience from my early trading days to illustrate where I'm coming from. I used to wake up at 4:30 am everyday in the Chicago suburbs to beat rush hour traffic and make it into downtown Chicago at 6:30 am. In order to wake up so early, I fell into a habit of sleeping at 9:00 pm and like a robot waking up at 4:30 am. This simple routine was indirectly helpful when things seemed darkest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For the first six months, I lost money and was ridiculed constantly by other traders who were more successful than me (which was about 20 other guys CONSTANTLY using me as a punching/whipping bag). The only thing that kept me going was the fact that some of the very same traders that would be making wise cracks at me for losing money were some of the most successful people I knew at the time. For better or worse, if I needed a trader to model myself after, it was the same people that were telling me how bad a trader I was - and although I was not open to really hear what they were saying, they were right about my skills in every way (but their feedback was always packaged in some sort of insult). After racking up some rather hefty losses, I was determined to quit at one point during month four, but because I had a habit of waking up at 4:30 am I simply &quot;forgot&quot; that the night before I told myself I would quit and spare myself further humiliation...by then I was warned that I was now on the red list of traders ready to be cut. Also, my personal savings were starting to approach zero (the base &quot;draw&quot; for house traders was enough to pay for food; you usually make your money on a percentage of your profits, and I was deep in the red at the time).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To say the least, there were many excellent reasons to be &quot;reasonable&quot;, forget about my dreams, and quit. After 4 consecutive &quot;failures to quit&quot;, I realized that I didn't quit because somewhere deep down I was hanging on to a dream, however remote at that point: that I could somehow be as successful as the other traders that I knew. At the same time I realized that I had hit rock bottom in that I couldn't even succeed in failing! Very tough times indeed... An interesting point to note here is that although my losses were starting to get very large, the people who were funding me as a trader kept me because I had one redeeming quality: EFFORT, and this helped build tenacity. Other traders who barely traded but had a fraction of my losses were cut much faster because they didn't put forth much effort. They were not willing to take losses and be bold/brave and fight it out; I was willing to take risks, and this saved me from getting cut faster than others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Slowly I began to reinterpret the constant humiliation I was suffering: perhaps the other traders were right about their &quot;jokes&quot; and there might be something in what they are saying that will help me get out of the red. I also realized that since I had failed at quitting (which was now the ULTIMATE failure), there was no further failure for me and that if I took baby steps they were surely to succeed (this translated into taking smaller trades/profits).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Only after improving upon my abilities as a trader and channeling my energies appropriately did I succeed and earn everybody's respect as a trader (and you have no idea how this made me feel!). I quickly made enough in commissions to be trading my own account, and be successful as an independent trader onward. When I look back at those final months of 1999 (yeah that's right, I was losing huge cash at the end of 1999 when the entire market was going crazy UP!), there was more good than bad even when I was getting my ass handed to me. It's just that I was intentionally creating my own feedback (I'm right everybody else is wrong) instead of seeing the results I was getting (losses/insults) as feedback and information that would help me be successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I kind of snicker every time I see somebody ask for feedback on their startup on YC.News only to end up justifying themselves by telling everybody why they did what they did when they get negative feedback, which is the feedback of greatest value. If somebody tells you how crappy your idea is, thank them that they even spent a few brain cycles considering your idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The lessons I learned from this that are perhaps relevant to your questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Determine if you believe in yourself to succeed as an individual (I know this sounds odd, but for a moment just examine your thought patterns and your actions and see what message you are sending to yourself; do you listen to the voice that says you can't or are you paying attention to the feedback from your efforts and the results you are getting?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Search deep down inside and see if the project you are working on is something you believe in or not. If you can't sell yourself, then you shouldn't bother trying any further...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- ANY attention you get for your efforts is good attention. If you get LOTS of negative feedback, then be grateful - you've jumped the first hurdle of getting people to give a damn about what you are doing! :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- There is responsibility and accountability that goes with both success and failure. You need to be ready for both because they can be equally painful in equal ways. The amount of accountability that comes with success can be more unbearable than the accountability that accompanies failure. I personally know of some very talented people who enjoyed phenomenal initial success only to find just as fast that they were in over their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- The more you resist the possibility of failure then you are less likely to recognize possibilities that will help you succeed. If you are afraid to fail, then most certainly you are afraid to succeed. This sounds counterintuitive but it's based upon the fact that fear makes your mind less supple and less responsive to the changes that will push you out of the game - or conversely it will lessen the impulse to jump on the opportunities you need to succeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- The results you get has everything to do with your users/market and less to do with you as an individual; it's sometimes hard to separate these two. See the other side of the equation and what side you are on before trying to solve it. Don't ever think you are above the feedback of your users...EVER!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Don't have expectations (this is just setting yourself up for failure). Because you are starting out you may not know what is best to help you succeed - ESPECIALLY if you're lacking motivation. Keep in mind that whatever results you get from your efforts will lead to more possibilities (in the form of additional information).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Have some behavioral &quot;context&quot; within which to exercise discipline and structure. Seek to grow your efforts within this context. My context was my sleep schedule. It was a routine that was so ingrained that my drive had a laser focus. This might not work for some, but it worked for me. Finally, I will add that in my opinion failing hard and fast is MUCH better than failing slowly. The faster you know for certain something isn't going to work out, the sooner you can cut your losses and move on to your next idea. When you eventually succeed, you will look back at all the times you were quick to cut your losses and get to where you are... ---------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Please do NOT contact me asking for advice in trading/investing. This is a VERY personal thing, and it has everything to do with who you are, NOT with how much information you have, or which tools you use, or who you know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Raspberry Pi – UASP, Trim, and Boot Performance via USB</title>
<link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-usb-boot-uasp-trim-and-performance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-usb-boot-uasp-trim-and-performance</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, I reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/fastest-usb-storage-options-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;USB drive performance on the Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/uasp-makes-raspberry-pi-4-disk-io-50-faster&quot;&gt;importance of UASP support&lt;/a&gt; for USB drive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both posts generated great discussion, and there were three things I wanted to cover in this follow-up, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which drives support UASP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-world performance benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRIM support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, here are all the products I'm testing in this post (product links are to their Amazon product page, starting from top middle, clockwise):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/usb-performance-devices-tested.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;USB Performance testing - SATA SSD, NVMe, and Flash drives&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a video version of this blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oufXAysaywk&quot;&gt;view video on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UASP support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in the last post, I completely forgot to discuss which of the USB drives I tested supported UASP, and which ones didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a refresher, UASP lets the Raspberry Pi communicate with the drive using the SCSI protocol, which is up to twice as fast for file copies and disk performance as the older 'USB mass storage' protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check if your own drive supports UASP with the command &lt;code&gt;lsusb -t&lt;/code&gt;. If the output shows 'uas', it supports it out of the box. If it shows 'usb-storage', it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a quick graph showing which drives support UASP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;UASP&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Device&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inatech enclosure with Kingston 120GB SSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TDBT M.2 enclosure with XPG SX6000 128GB NVMe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Corsair Flash Voyager GTX 128GB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arcanite 128GB USB 3.1 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SanDisk Ultra Flair 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Samsung Evo+ 32GB microSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like all the fastest drives I benchmarked support it, while all the slowest ones don't. No huge surprise there; the faster drives use better chipsets that are built for SSD performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arcanite is an outlier, though. It doesn't support UASP, but it does perform very well for its price. And it sometimes behaves a little like an SSD—I'll talk about that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second thing I wanted to cover, I was prompted by none other than Gordon Hollingworth, the Director of Engineering at Raspberry Pi, in his Twitter post. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;6.5701754385965&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What would be really interesting is how the different SD card, usb flash and nvme storage compare in terms of booting time and time to start a web page from the command line...&lt;/p&gt;
— Gordon Hollingworth (@gsholling) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gsholling/status/1291648954854146050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'll test boot time performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boot Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing when measuring boot time is to find a way to compare different devices using an objective measure. That is, you don't want to sit around with a stopwatch and try to time 'from plug-in to desktop appearing' boot times. That could be helpful sometimes, but it's not very objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I use a built-in tool in Raspberry Pi OS, called &lt;code&gt;systemd-analyze&lt;/code&gt;. It's a tool that helps you analyze the system manager, and by default, if you just run that command, it will output the boot time. How easy is that?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did that, three times for each drive, and averaged the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/graph-usb-boot-performance.png&quot; alt=&quot;USB boot performance for Raspberry Pi 4&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the drives performed pretty well, though the non-UASP drives did tend to be slower, with the strange exception of the SanDisk Ultra Flair, which punched above its weight class. The slowest by far was the SanDisk Ultra Fit, which I mentioned in the previous post has a tendency to overheat and slow way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are two important caveats to these boot time numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I booted with the August 2020 version of Rasbperry Pi OS, and followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/im-booting-my-raspberry-pi-4-usb-ssd&quot;&gt;directions in this blog post&lt;/a&gt; to configure the USB drive to be able to boot the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it seems like the Pi already optimized its boot performance really well. The first boot was always a bit slower, but subsequent boots took around 15-17 seconds, on all the USB drives I tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference was that first boot was much faster on the faster SSDs and NVMe drive, and a bit slower on the cheap flash drives and the microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Browser launch time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing Gordon mentioned in his tweet was testing the web browser launch time from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually took a bit of doing, figuring out a way to launch Chromium from the command line, load a web page, and then quit it, and get an accurate time measurement of the process. Just using &lt;code&gt;chromium-browser [URL here]&lt;/code&gt; didn't cut it, because that launched the browser, and the process wouldn't exit until I manually quit the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1303779579228717057&quot;&gt;asking on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; about what others might do, I found a neat Node.js utility called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/&quot;&gt;'puppeteer'&lt;/a&gt;, which I could use to do it all automatically, and then I used the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; utility in Linux to benchmark the process three times for each drive. I described how I did this benchmark in detail in this post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/testing-how-long-it-takes-chromium-open-load-web-page-and-quit-on-debian&quot;&gt;Testing how long it takes Chromium to open, load a web page, and quit on Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/usb-web-browser-performance.png&quot; alt=&quot;USB drive web browser performance for Raspberry Pi 4&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference really isn't that big. Definitely not as big as I thought it would be. The faster drives still open Chromium a tiny bit faster—especially on first launch—but only a tiny bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested all of these Pis over a VNC connection, with the resolution set in &lt;code&gt;raspi-config&lt;/code&gt; to 1280x720. And just like the boot times, the first launch of the browser after a reboot would take a bit longer than the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this just means the caching mechanisms in Linux are good at normalizing performance for even very slow boot volumes, as long as you have enough system memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once booted for the second time and after quitting and restarting Chrome, the difference in common UI tasks between the slowest drive and the NVMe drive was almost imperceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things, especially when you're doing upgrades, installing software, writing files, or working on large projects (like Drupal websites I maintain) where the difference is more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that, I installed &lt;code&gt;php7.3-cli&lt;/code&gt; on each of the drives, and checked how long that took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/usb-php-install-performance.png&quot; alt=&quot;USB drive PHP installation performance on Raspberry Pi 4&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And... as with the other performance tests, this one is not the most consistent. I ran it a couple times on some of the drives, re-flashing the entire drive between runs, and the standard deviation—the variance between runs—was usually around 20%, so take these results with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the faster drives &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do better, but it was hard to get exact numbers when benchmarking real-world workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TRIM support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally, in a Hacker News thread, user Legogris &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24075035&quot;&gt;asked about TRIM&lt;/a&gt;, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you aware if the GTX and Arcanite support TRIM? That definitely makes a difference when considering OS storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why would Legogris be interested in TRIM support? Well, the short answer is with SSDs, when little bits of data are deleted, and new data needs to be written to where those old deleted bits were, the drive can slow down and also do more work than it should have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/win95-defragment.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Defragmenting a Windows 95 Hard Drive&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really simple answer, but basically think of it like 'automatic defragmentation' for an SSD. I don't know if you've ever had the honor of sitting in front of an old Windows computer watching it defragment your 80 MB IDE drive for hours on end, but it's kind of like that, at warp speed. TRIM doesn't do defragmentation, technically, but it's similar in that it lets your SSD perform its best through some automatic cleanup processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard thing is, you have to have TRIM support in both your operating system—in our case, Raspberry Pi OS (which does support TRIM)—and in the drive controller's firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to check for TRIM support, like running the &lt;code&gt;fstrim&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo fstrim -v /
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it says &lt;code&gt;the discard operation is not supported&lt;/code&gt;, then TRIM isn't currently working for your drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also run the &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;lsblk -D
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;DISC-MAX&lt;/code&gt; value is &lt;code&gt;0B&lt;/code&gt;, then, again, TRIM isn't currently working for your drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many adapters will work with TRIM after you follow a special process to change their 'provisioning mode'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a separate blog post with details on how to enable TRIM support if your firmware supports it but it's not enabled by default: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/enabling-trim-on-external-ssd-on-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;Enabling TRIM on an external SSD on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some drive controllers may also need a firmware update to enable TRIM support, so check on your drive manufacturer's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results for all the drives I tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Device&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TRIM OOTB&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TRIM support in Firmware&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Inatech enclosure with Kingston 120GB SSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;TDBT M.2 enclosure with XPG SX6000 128GB NVMe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Corsair Flash Voyager GTX 128GB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Arcanite 128GB USB 3.1 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⁉️&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;SanDisk Ultra Flair 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 flash drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Samsung Evo+ 32GB microSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the Inatech enclosure didn't seem to have any TRIM support, while the TDBT NVMe enclosure and the Corsair did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is something I never thought about—the Raspberry Pi actually supports TRIM out of the box for internal microSD cards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most &lt;em&gt;alarming&lt;/em&gt; result is that the Arcanite firmware indicated TRIM support, but when I followed the process to change the provisioning mode and ran &lt;code&gt;fstrim&lt;/code&gt;, the drive failed spectacularly, and now I can't even mount or initialize the thing on any computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... the Arcanite firmware may be from an SSD, but the flash memory itself seemed to not take well to the &lt;code&gt;fstrim&lt;/code&gt; command. Either that, or I had one defective unit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I found there are a lot of different traits, positive and negative, on all the drives I tested. If you just need a drive to store large files, I still think the Arcanite is the best overall value, even though it doesn't support UASP, and it kind of explodes if you try enabling TRIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're after raw performance, an NVMe inside an enclosure is going to give the best bang for your buck, as well as—at least in the case of the TDBT enclosure I tested—full TRIM and UASP support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, if you have any USB 3.0 drive, outside of cheap flash drives, it's probably going to perform as well as or better than a microSD card in a Raspberry Pi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
