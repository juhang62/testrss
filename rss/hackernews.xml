<title>T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&amp;T phone calls are failing across the US</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292024/t-mobile-verizon-att-calls-failing-down-phone-networks-us-carriers</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;JqcP2l&quot;&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers are experiencing issues placing calls across the US, according to user reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://downdetector.com/&quot;&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maggiereimherr/status/1272590911193694208&quot;&gt;on social media&lt;/a&gt;, with reports spiking around 2:20 PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aEApoQ&quot;&gt;The issue appears to be entirely on T-Mobile’s end: While AT&amp;amp;T tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its network is “operating normally” and Verizon says its network is “performing well,” T-Mobile confirmed that it’s working to fix “a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;8.9156626506024&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Teams continue to work as quickly as possible to fix the voice &amp;amp; messaging problems some are seeing.&lt;br/&gt;Data services are now available &amp;amp; some calls are completing. Alternate services like WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Facetime etc. are available. Thanks for your patience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uQiGSAFEAH&quot;&gt;https://t.co/uQiGSAFEAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IXlN2D&quot;&gt;Verizon also says it’s not to blame: “We’re aware that another carrier is having network issues. Calls to and from that carrier may receive an error message,” reads part of a statement from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Prig9p&quot;&gt;As of 6:02PM ET, T-Mobile appears to be resolving the issue, tweeting that “data services are now available” and that “some calls are completing,” but it doesn’t yet have a timeline for a full fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d0U3IV&quot;&gt;Multiple &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers were unable to place calls on T-Mobile. It appears both Sprint, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203146/tmobile-sprint-customers-plans-network-billing-carriers-merger&quot;&gt;now a T-Mobile subsidiary&lt;/a&gt;, and US Cellular are also experiencing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nUEeCB&quot;&gt;It’s unclear what the issue might be at this time. It makes sense that what appears to be a multi-network outage could actually stem from a single carrier, since people reporting failed calls don’t always know which carrier their recipient is using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cqvbCS&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 15th, 7:02 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added additional T-Mobile statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Recently minted database technologies that I find intriguing</title>
<link>https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; fan of databases, so much so that I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://7dbs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;written a book&lt;/a&gt; on so-called “NoSQL” databases, I spent some of my most fruitful years in tech working on the highly influential distributed database &lt;a href=&quot;https://riak.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Riak&lt;/a&gt;, and I even built a database called &lt;a href=&quot;https://purpledb.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Purple&lt;/a&gt; last year just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I’m always on the lookout for new and exciting developments in databases and DB-related tools when I scan (trash fires like) Twitter, Reddit, and HackerNews. In this post I’d like to talk about three recently minted database technologies that I find intriguing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 2 I’ll cover three others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 3 I’ll conclude with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/#thoughts&quot;&gt;closing thoughts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ll be focusing exclusively on the core technologies and mostly ignoring things like enterprise features (where applicable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.5815217391304&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My selection criteria are purely subjective. If there’s something you don’t see here that you think I should be checking out, tweet at me and let me know! My handle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucperkins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@lucperkins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tiledb&quot;&gt;TileDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tiledb.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TileDB&lt;/a&gt; is a DB built around &lt;a href=&quot;http://matlab.izmiran.ru/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/ch_dat32.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multi-dimensional arrays&lt;/a&gt; that enables you to easily work with types that aren’t a great fit for existing RDBMS systems, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/basic-concepts/definitions/dense-vs-sparse-array&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dense and sparse arrays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/handling-dataframes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dataframes&lt;/a&gt;. TileDB is specifically geared toward use cases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/genomics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genomics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/geospatial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;geospatial&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;noteworthy-features&quot;&gt;Noteworthy features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swappable data backends with support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://min.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MinIO&lt;/a&gt;, and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage integrations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HDFS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prestodb.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PrestoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://spark.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dask&lt;/a&gt;, and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language bindings for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/usage/c-cpp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C/C++&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/usage/python&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/usage/r&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/usage/java&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/usage/go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-like-most&quot;&gt;What I like most&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of “specialty” DBs like this that hone in on a specific set of data types and problems. The great thing about traditional RDBMSes is that they’re versatile enough to cover an extremely wide array of use cases (no pun intended) but sometimes you have “last mile” edge cases that are both (a) beyond the capabilities of “kitchen sink” systems and also (b) at the core of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to see the emergence of more systems like this as database use cases become ever more specialized and new problem domains emerge. The old guard RDBMSes aren’t going anywhere, of course, but it’s nonetheless encouraging to see TileDB and others pushing the envelope. What I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hoping for is the emergence of extremely “hackable,” resolutely non-monolithic DBs that provide a plugin interface for highly use-case-specific data types, but this is something I’ll talk about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-for-the-project&quot;&gt;Questions for the project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much work is done on the client library side versus the database side? Are the TileDB clients essentially language-specific math libraries for manipulating complex data types locally and occasionally saving the results to the desired backend &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; are they like other DB client libraries that mostly just relay commands to the database? It’s not entirely clear from the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the rationale for providing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tiledb.com/main/handling-key-value-stores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;key-value store&lt;/a&gt; given the plethora of existing K/V options? The docs even say that “TileDB is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; designed to work as a special-purpose key-value store.” What’s the value of ratcheting on a feature like this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;materialize&quot;&gt;Materialize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://materialize.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Materialize&lt;/a&gt; touts itself on its website as “the first true SQL streaming database” and that actually may not be overblown! It’s essentially a relational database that’s wire compatible with &lt;a href=&quot;https://postgresql.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; but with the crucial difference that it offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;materialized views&lt;/a&gt; that are updated &lt;em&gt;in real time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also seen Materialize described as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://materialize.io/blog-introduction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;streaming data warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, which seems fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standard Postgres, for example, you have to manually update materialized views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; MATERIALIZED &lt;span&gt;VIEW&lt;/span&gt; my_view (&lt;span&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;);

REFRESH MATERIALIZED &lt;span&gt;VIEW&lt;/span&gt; my_view;

&lt;span&gt;/* The underlying tables change */&lt;/span&gt;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED &lt;span&gt;VIEW&lt;/span&gt; my_view;

&lt;span&gt;/* More stuff happens */&lt;/span&gt;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED &lt;span&gt;VIEW&lt;/span&gt; my_view;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this as frequently as you’d like, perhaps using a script or a cron job. What I have yet to see but always secretly wanted, however, is a database that natively supports &lt;em&gt;incremental updates&lt;/em&gt; to materialized views. Yep, that’s right: Materialize &lt;em&gt;listens for changes&lt;/em&gt; in the data sources that you specify and updates your views as those sources change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Materialize doesn’t “win” or stick around for very long, I suspect that the capabilities that it brings to the table are here to stay and will almost certainly be reproduced in DBs down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;noteworthy-features-1&quot;&gt;Noteworthy features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diverse range of data sources, including other tables (as in standard Postgres), JSON, CSV, and other files, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kinesis&lt;/a&gt; topics, and most likely many others in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core engine is powered by two really powerful constructs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://timelydataflow.github.io/timely-dataflow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;timely dataflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://timelydataflow.github.io/differential-dataflow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;differential dataflow&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t go over these here but I strongly recommend delving into those concepts yourself. The very academic-leaning creators of Materialize have been deeply involved with both projects, so you can trust that Materialize is the product &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of a “hacker ethos” but rather an extremely careful, fastidious process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Materialize is wire compatible with Postgres, you can still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psql&lt;/a&gt; and all the other Postgres tools you’ve become accustomed to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-like-most-1&quot;&gt;What I like most&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialize has the potential to replace a lot of things. Most obviously, it lets you full-on jettison any existing processes you have for incrementally updating your materialized views. That’s a moderately sized win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The much bigger win for me, however, is that Materialize lets you decommission those portions of your data stack devoted to listening for changes on your data sources. You can do things like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://materialize.io/docs/sql/create-source/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;natively&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;SOURCE&lt;/span&gt; click_events
&lt;span&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; KAFKA BROKER &lt;span&gt;'localhost:9092'&lt;/span&gt; TOPIC &lt;span&gt;'click_events'&lt;/span&gt;
FORMAT AVRO &lt;span&gt;USING&lt;/span&gt; CONFLUENT &lt;span&gt;SCHEMA&lt;/span&gt; REGISTRY &lt;span&gt;'http://localhost:8081'&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your DB is now “aware” of a data source that it can use to construct auto-updating materialized views. This native “piping” feels even more magical to me than auto-updating views. If you’re running, say, serverless functions or &lt;a href=&quot;https://heron.apache.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heron&lt;/a&gt; jobs or &lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flink&lt;/a&gt; pipelines that do nothing more than listen here and write an &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statement there, Materialize will enable you to unceremoniously cut out that part of your stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-for-the-project-1&quot;&gt;Questions for the project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why a separate DB and not a Postgres &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/external-extensions.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt;? I’m sure there are good architectural reasons for why an extension wouldn’t cut it here but I’d love to know what that is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy is it to build extensions for other data sources? How could I write, for example, an extension for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulsar.apache.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache Pulsar&lt;/a&gt;? Do you plan on exposing an API for this to developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;prisma&quot;&gt;Prisma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://prisma.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prisma&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a database but rather a set of tools that seek to abstract away your database as much as possible. It’s currently compatible with &lt;a href=&quot;https://postgresql.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mysql.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; on the DB side and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javascript.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;lhttps://www.typescriptlang.org&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; on the language side (with support for more DBs and languages on the horizon). It touts itself as the “data layer for modern applications” and that sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Path for using Prisma goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define your application-level data types using Prisma’s schema SDL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate highly idiomatic code for your language of choice out of your created schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get busy creating REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and whatever else you want to build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I do understand the hesitance that some might have toward something like Prisma. A large subset of devs don’t want the database abstracted away. They don’t want clever DSLs and GUIs. They want to write plain SQL and they want to handcraft all their DB interaction code. I completely understand the desire to retain that degree of control, but I would nonetheless encourage you to spend 20-30 minutes giving Prisma a try. I think it does a very good job of carefully sailing between the Scylla of too much sugar and the Charybdis of raw SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;noteworthy-features-2&quot;&gt;Noteworthy features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prisma Client&lt;/a&gt; enables you to define your desired data types using a specialized schema SDL that generates code for you. Even the connection information for your database disappears from your application code and into the generated code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prisma Migrate&lt;/a&gt; enables you to define DB migrations declaratively (rather than imperatively as with SQL). The messy details of how the DB gets from state &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to state &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; are hidden from view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-studio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prisma Studio&lt;/a&gt; is a visual editor that essentially provides a GUI over the other Prisma tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-like-most-2&quot;&gt;What I like most&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prisma &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;schema DSL&lt;/a&gt; is a way of defining not only the data types you need for your application but also which code generator you want to use and connection information for the DB you’re connecting to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it provides enums, convenient annotations like &lt;code&gt;@id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@relation&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@default&lt;/code&gt;. It’s reminiscent of both the DB migration DSLs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecto&lt;/a&gt; and also IDLs like those used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Protocol Buffers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thrift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d really love to see the Prisma schema SDL or something like it adopted as a language-neutral standard (consumable by language-specific libraries). The status quo is that every programming language reinvents the wheel. I think it’d be beneficial to have a language-agnostic way of defining those types that define the relationship between the application and the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, a quick shoutout to Prisma’s exceedingly beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisma.io/docs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I absolutely consider this a feature and if your docs don’t belong in the “what I like most” section of a blog post then you should invest more resources into tech writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would Prisma also be useful in languages that already have widely used ORMs? If I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt; for Ruby or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecto&lt;/a&gt; for Elixir, what’s my incentive to switch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is awkward, but why is Prisma a company? I don’t know how to pay you money and I don’t know what that money would be for 🤷🏼‍♂️ I like free stuff so I’ll take it but I’d love to hear where this is all going.&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-676640 size-full&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xwindows_2000_hero.jpg.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.S8sQqzE8sn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Windows 2000 logo.&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Microsoft released Windows 2000. A rock-solid, 32-bit business-oriented alternative to Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition, it paved the way for future consumer versions, including Windows 10. Here’s why we remember it so fondly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;div-thetop1&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-9173525300015284&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2986027408&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It Was Based on Windows NT, Not MS-DOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released worldwide on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/2000/02/17/windows-2000-the-next-generation-of-pc-computing-available-worldwide-today/&quot;&gt;February 17, 2000,&lt;/a&gt; Windows 2000 started as &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/1998/10/27/windows-2000-is-a-name-that-reflects-nts-continued-move-to-the-technology-mainstream/&quot;&gt;Windows NT 5.0&lt;/a&gt;, the latest in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT&quot;&gt;Windows NT&lt;/a&gt; line of professional Microsoft operating systems. Microsoft created Windows NT from scratch in the early 1990s as part of a fundamental shift away from MS-DOS-based versions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/674574/windows-3.0-is-30-years-old-heres-what-made-it-special/&quot;&gt;Windows 3.x&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the ’90s, Microsoft maintained DOS-based Windows along with NT to serve those who were still dependent on legacy MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows software. Microsoft was eager to transition to NT for all, but the system requirements for a reasonably useful Windows NT machine far exceeded what most consumers had at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the late ’90s, many consumer PCs were finally powerful enough to run Windows NT, so they became ripe targets for potential Windows 2000 installations. Some at Microsoft hoped Windows 2000 would be the transition point for consumer Windows to become NT. However, Microsoft decided to hold off until Windows XP in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made many who used Windows 2000 feel that much cooler for getting a taste of a stable Windows operating system ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Was Rock-Solid Stable, Unlike Windows Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-676723 size-full&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xwindows_2000_logo.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.FzHciicH-w.png&quot; alt=&quot;Windows 2000 logo.&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; data-credittext=&quot;Microsoft&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imagecredit&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used a PC in the late ’90s, you were quite familiar with the frequent crashes, lockups, and reboots that were common on MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 9x. The DOS-based PC ecosystem was a house of cards built on an ancient patchwork of code that ran on endless variations of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DOS-based Windows became more complex and feature-laden, more people began to rely on their PCs for serious work, and the instability issues came to a head. Windows 98 frequently required reboots and reinstallation to fix puzzling, recurrent issues with applications that conflicted with each other and the OS. Critics widely panned Windows Me (released in September 2000), the last in the line of MS-DOS-based Windows, for being bloated and unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Windows 2000, which ran with rock-solid stability on the very same hardware most people used with Windows 98. At the time, being able to leave a computer running without it crashing, and not having to reboot after installing software seemed like a miracle. In fact, Microsoft included &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815225927/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/guide/professional/features/default.asp&quot;&gt;“Dramatically Reduced Reboot Scenarios”&lt;/a&gt; as one of the primary selling features of Windows 2000 on its website back in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people were delighted to hear about the stability possible with an NT-based operating system. In December 2000, someone called DAEtrader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/windows-2000-vs-windows-nt-4-0.856/&quot;&gt;posted the following about Windows 2000:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I assumed the weird lockups, or freezes, or erratic error messages were to be expected from any platform. But I’m encouraged to hear there is a more stable platform than Win98.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Was Full of Useful New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-676722 size-full&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xwindows_2000_example.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.782kGfH8TN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;My Documents,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Control Panel,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Calculator&amp;quot; opened on a Windows 2000 desktop.&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000 shipped in four different editions: Professional, Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server. Windows 2000 Professional was aimed squarely at enterprise desktop customers and was the version used the most. All of them included advanced new features that made Windows 2000 an attractive upgrade for both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new OS also introduced interface changes designed to align Windows NT with Windows 98. It also supported technologies like Active Desktop, USB, NTFS 3.0, and FAT32. The inclusion of DirectX support made Windows 2000 compatible with many modern computer games. It also brought NT one step closer to becoming a universal consumer/business crossover operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few vital OS features that are considered core components of Windows today first appeared on Windows 2000. These included Microsoft Installer, which provided a more uniform program install/uninstall experience and Windows File Protection for system files. The Microsoft Management Console made it easy to manage vital system functions from a unified interface, while the Recovery Console helped after catastrophic software failures. And Active Directory offered a new way to manage Windows network domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the press criticized some of Windows 2000’s driver support at launch, the OS actually supported far more hardware configurations than Windows NT 4.0. These included peripherals, and sound and graphics cards, making it the first widely-compatible version of NT, and not just for businesses, but for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Was Free If You Pirated It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although intended as a business desktop operating system, Windows 2000 Professional also found its way to many home PCs. This was due to both its reputation for stability and, of course, rampant piracy thanks to CD-R drives and the relative leniency of the serial-number-based copy protection Microsoft used at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also expensive: Windows 2000 Professional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-outlines-windows-2000-pricing/&quot;&gt;retailed for $319&lt;/a&gt; (about $481 today, when adjusted for inflation). Many considered it too pricey, as Windows 98 &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/1999/05/05/microsoft-windows-98-second-edition-released-to-manufacturing/&quot;&gt;retailed for $109&lt;/a&gt; (about $164 today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it didn’t ship on consumer-level PCs, if you wanted it on a home machine, you either had to buy it or get a copy from someone who had a copy sitting around at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of Windows 98 and Windows Me crashes, Windows 2000 was a revelation on consumer machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Was Also a Viable Windows XP Alternative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-676724 size-full&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xwindows_xp_screenshot.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.d3YrsBK_eU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Start menu on a Windows XP desktop with the green field and sky background. &quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;Some people disliked XP’s colorful theme.
&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000 also served as an alternative to its successor, Windows XP, for several years. XP included some features that were controversial at the time. These included an Internet-based product activation system that complained if you changed your PC hardware, and a colorful new shell interface some derided as “Fisher-Price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more professional, gray appearance of Windows 2000 was preferable to some, and it could also run most XP programs just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Paved the Way for the Future of Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Microsoft, Windows 2000 represented a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/1998/10/27/microsoft-renames-windows-nt-5-0-product-line-to-windows-2000-signals-evolution-of-windows-nt-technology-into-mainstream/&quot;&gt;crucial step&lt;/a&gt; for bringing the much more stable, technologically mature Windows NT platform to the masses. It proved that a technically advanced Windows OS could also have a consumer-friendly interface and multimedia-friendly features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows Division at Microsoft (who managed Office at the time), told us just how critical Windows 2000 was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Had we not done Windows 2000, then we would never have done Windows XP. It finally brought the NT OS to a consumer operating system with compatibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000 was an essential link in an unbroken chain that started with Windows NT 1.0 in 1993 and continues to this day with Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Finally, the System Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-676732 size-full&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xwin2000_splash.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.qoq-P-Nwho.png&quot; alt=&quot;Windows 2000 Professional Splash Screen&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; data-credittext=&quot;Microsoft&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imagecredit&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a true blast from the past, let’s take a look at Windows 2000 Professional’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815225947/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/guide/professional/sysreq/default.asp&quot;&gt;bare minimum system requirements&lt;/a&gt; at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;133 MHz or higher Pentium-compatible CPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum; more memory generally improves responsiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 GB hard disk with a minimum of 650 MB of free space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 2000 Professional supports single and dual CPU systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, Windows 2000 needed a beefier machine to provide a reasonable experience, but not by much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, Windows 2000! We’ve certainly come a long way in both hardware capability and breadth of features, but we couldn’t have done it without you!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Six eBay executives and employees charged over alleged cyberstalking campaign</title>
<link>https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/15/ebay-employees-arrested-u-s-attorney-andrew-lelling-cyberstalking/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/15/ebay-employees-arrested-u-s-attorney-andrew-lelling-cyberstalking/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;BOSTON (CBS) – Six former eBay executives and employees are facing federal charges after they allegedly led a cyberstalking campaign against a Natick couple they believed was critical of the company in an online ecommerce newsletter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said the eBay employees’ harassment included sending the couple “disturbing deliveries” that included a bloody pig mask, a box of live cockroaches, and a funeral wreath. The employees also allegedly sent anonymous threatening messages and traveled to Massachusetts to conduct “covert surveillance” of the victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was a determined, systematic effort of senior employees of a major company to destroy the lives of a couple in Natick, all because they published content company executives didn’t like,” said Lelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;James Baugh, 45, of San Jose, California, eBay’s former director of safety and security and former eBay director of global resiliency David Harville, 48, of New York City, were among the six charged Monday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also charged were Stephanie Popp, 32, of San Jose; Stephanie Stockwell, 26, of Redwood City, Calif.; Veronica Zeak, 26, of San Jose; and Brian Gilbert, 51, of San Jose. Each is charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Popp was eBay’s senior manager of global intelligence, Stockwell was the company’s manager of global intelligence center (GIC), Zea was a contractor who worked as an intelligence analyst within the GIC, and Gilbert was a senior manager of special operations for eBay’s global security team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gilbert is also a former police captain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1068681&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1068681&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The former eBay employees are accused of sending this bloody pig mask and this book about death and grief to a Natick couple. (WBZ-TV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lelling said the Natick couple serves as editor and publisher for an online newsletter that covers ecommerce companies. According to prosecutors, members of eBay’s executive leadership team followed the newsletter and took issue with the content and anonymous comments under the stories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2019, two members of the leadership team allegedly sent or forwarded text messages saying it was time to “take down” the newsletter’s editor. One of the messages said the group wanted to “crush this lady,” referring to the editor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked if further charges could be filed against other executives, Lelling said “The investigaton is active and ongoing.” Two unnamed executives are included in the complaint that had roles above Baugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t think I would characterize the conduct as rogue, because as seen in the complaint, the directive to do something about this goes pretty high up the chain within eBay,” said Lelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The couple then received a host of deliveries aimed at intimidating them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These deliveries included fly larvae and live spiders, a box of live cockroaches, a sympathy wreath on the occasion of the death of a loved one, a book of advice on how to survive the death of a spouse, pornography mailed to their next door neighbors but in the couple’s names, Halloween masks featuring the face of the bloody pig, and the pig fetus which was ordered, but after an inquiry by the supplier, thankfully, wasn’t ever sent,” Lelling said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling on Cyberstalking Charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On August 18 just after midnight, the eBay employees allegedly posted a classified ad on Craigslist claiming to be from the Natick couple inviting “singles, couples and swingers” to their house to party after 10 p.m. every night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People were encouraged to knock on the couple’s door, anytime day or night,” said Lelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of the employees were fired by eBay following an investigation. Lelling said the company cooperated with investigators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For a while they succeeded, psychologically devastating these victims for weeks,” Lelling said.“The result as alleged in the complaint was a systematic campaign fueled by the resources of a Fortune 500 company to emotionally and psychologically terrorize this middle aged couple in Natick, with the goal of deterring them from writing bad things online about eBay.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;eBay said it was notified in August 2019 about the alleged conduct of its employees and launched a “comprehensive investigation.” All of the employees involved were fired in September 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“eBay took these allegations very seriously from the outset. Upon learning of them, eBay moved quickly to investigate thoroughly and take appropriate action,” an independent special committee formed by eBay’s Board of Directors said in a statement. “The Company cooperated fully and extensively with law enforcement authorities throughout the process. eBay does not tolerate this kind of behavior. eBay apologizes to the affected individuals and is sorry that they were subjected to this. eBay holds its employees to high standards of conduct and ethics and will continue to take appropriate action to ensure these standards are followed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the investigation included what role former eBay CEO Devin Wenig may have had in the incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The internal investigation found that, while Mr. Wenig’s communications were inappropriate, there was no evidence that he knew in advance about or authorized the actions that were later directed toward the blogger and her husband. However, as the company previously announced, there were a number of considerations leading to his departure from the company,” eBay said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another update on the WD Red SMR drive story. To be more precise, we have several updates. Since WD has remained silent on this subject, and we, as a community, need to get the word out to keep customers informed, it was time for a follow-up piece. In this edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jim Salter at Ars Technica confirms what we saw in ZFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found evidence that WD-HGST has said DM-SMR is not good for reliable performance, even discussing ZFS issues for years. Effectively, they had reason to know the drives would not work well in, at least ZFS NAS units, if not other NAS applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cover a great user story of actual experience with 6TB WD Red DM-SMR drives in a non-ZFS Synology NAS. WD did a great job doing the right thing and replacing his drives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discuss a theory on how these drives were qualified by WD and drive vendors, but now de-certified/ de-qualified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discuss a theory on the conspicuous silence with no updates from WD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a lot to cover here, so let us get to it.&lt;span id=&quot;more-44143&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accompanying Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to listen along, here is the accompanying video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;WD Knew DM-SMR and ZFS were a bad match!?! WD Red SMR 3&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPlaEiSQR1o?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, more detail is below for those who are interested, but we recognize some prefer different media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ars Technica Confirms What We Saw in ZFS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set the scheduled publishing time for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/surreptitiously-swapping-smr-into-hard-drives-must-end/&quot;&gt;first hard drive SMR piece&lt;/a&gt;, I felt like we needed to get some data. I was very worried that the time it would take would mean others would beat us to the story. Once the first set of results came in, we saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/&quot;&gt;terrible WD Red DM-SMR performance&lt;/a&gt; in a ZFS NAS array rebuild scenario. One of the great parts of the tech community is that others will often try for themselves. Jim Salter at Ars Technica did just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim tested a RAID 6 array using 12TB drives partitioned to 4TB to see rebuild times and various performance angles with the WD Red DM-SMR drives. He certainly found a difference in testing. In these tests, while he saw a difference, he did not see the dramatic difference we saw on the ZFS side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the charts in the article look not too bad, but when you click through to some of the next-level charts, some start to look not great. Jim mentions them in the article, but if you are skimming, you may miss this. Our advice, read Jim’s article thoroughly because he explains some less great findings that are not highlighted via charts in the default page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-dm-smr-update-3-vendors-bail-and-wd-knew-of-zfs-issues/wd-red-dm-smr-ars-technica-example-of-third-chart-in-the-block/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-44165&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44165&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WD Red DM SMR Ars Technica Example Of Third Chart In The Block&quot; width=&quot;983&quot; height=&quot;784&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block.jpg 983w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block-376x300.jpg 376w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block-800x638.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block-696x555.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WD-Red-DM-SMR-Ars-Technica-Example-of-Third-Chart-in-the-Block-527x420.jpg 527w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WD Red DM SMR Ars Technica Example Of Third Chart In The Block
&lt;p&gt;In this example, one can see the first (default) thumbnail. If you are skimming the article, we suggest at least clicking on the other charts in these blocks because there are some that paint the WD Red DM-SMR drives in a less favorable light. Being clear, in the text, Jim discusses these in his text so it is not that they are hidden. They can just be hard to see when scrolling through and skimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim also profiled a ZFS rebuild more similar to what we did. He got similar results. Combined with what we have heard from ZFS NAS companies and heard from users, this is a fairly clear story that ZFS and DM-SMR are not a good match. We are going to talk more about that later, as well as some stories of real-users on non-ZFS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I think it is great that Ars did this testing so there is more data out there. From experience, this requires a lot to produce. Please check out that Ars Technica article &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/western-digitals-smr-disks-arent-great-but-theyre-not-garbage/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We may have differing views of the impact, however, I always encourage our readers to get more data to make better decisions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick note here, some folks have pointed to the “NASCompares” testing. Something I learned only in the last few days (via a major NAS vendor) is that the NASCompares folks are not an independent site like Ars or STH. Instead, according to the NAS vendor, they are affiliated with a NAS reseller who may have sold NAS units using these drives. While those results are meaningful, we are more focused on independent site results along with user experiences for this article. We encourage our readers to get any information they can, but also filter based on the context of the testing. Our testing was done without vendor support. We were simply interested in ourselves as consumers of the drives and for our readers. This is why we used ZFS as that is very common for us to use as well as for our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WD-HGST Said DM-SMR Drives Are Not Suitable at an OpenZFS Conference in 2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HGST Engineer Manfred Berger speaking at OpenZFS European Conference in 2015 gave an awesome overview of SMR technology, what it is, and why we need it. You can see the video here. He did a great job explaining why the industry is moving to SMR for hard drives since it increases storage density and the amount of storage one can get per dollar. It is one of the better talks I have seen talking about technical and practical reasons behind a SMR transition. This is a great video worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;Manfred Berger - HGST SMR - OpenZFS European Conference 2015&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2lnMxMUxyc?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the middle of the video (timestamp &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/a2lnMxMUxyc?t=806&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the discussion is on how HGST sees DM-SMR as not a good fit with performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manfred is discussing with the ZFS folks development efforts to support SMR, significant for ZFS. Later in the video, he was discussing with the OpenZFS developers just how much work it would take to make SMR drives work with ZFS (mostly focusing on host managed SMR. You can see that discussion during the Q&amp;amp;A starting around &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/a2lnMxMUxyc?t=1504&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask why are we talking about this excellent presentation. It turns out Manfred works at HGST, a Western Digital company. Again, given his presentation at OpenZFS in 2015, this is a knowledgeable gentleman and from that video alone has the ability to articulate storage concepts in a way that any storage company would be better for having someone like this on their team. Of note, he is not on the WD Red team per his LinkedIn profile, but HGST and WD have been active in OpenZFS. This is just an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we have a WD employee saying five years ago DM-SMR is no good. He is saying there are performance issues. He engaged in a discussion on the implications for ZFS. Of course, that may not represent current thinking since everyone is entitled to change opinions as they get more information, but the idea that WD-HGST had no idea that ZFS may be an option, and people may see performance issues over time, is seemingly far fetched at this point. This is what we saw in our testing data so it seems what we found is what would be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZFS is not just FreeNAS, TrueNAS, or Oracle/ Sun. Instead, it is in products as simple as Ubuntu as a desktop installation option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see it in products such as Proxmox VE, and we use ZFS all over the STH hosting cluster from our backup NAS to web hosting nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other vendors are getting in on this too. There are a number of smaller players that use ZFS now for their NAS system and QNAP has a line that is dedicated to using ZFS and they are increasingly looking toward ZFS. In our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/our-switchnaserver-or-qnap-qgd-1600p-review/&quot;&gt;“SwitchNAServer” or QNAP QGD-1600P Review&lt;/a&gt;, we were greeted by a QTS hero ZFS integration announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/our-switchnaserver-or-qnap-qgd-1600p-review/qnap-qgd-1600p-qts-hero-with-zfs-in-development/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-44080&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44080&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;QNAP QGD 1600P QTS Hero With ZFS In Development&quot; width=&quot;1290&quot; height=&quot;756&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development.jpg 1290w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development-400x234.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development-800x469.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development-696x408.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development-1068x626.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/QNAP-QGD-1600P-QTS-Hero-with-ZFS-In-Development-717x420.jpg 717w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;QNAP QGD 1600P QTS Hero With ZFS In Development
&lt;p&gt;It may not be the most popular, but it is growing in popularity, even among major Linux distributions and traditional SMB NAS vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem Goes Beyond ZFS Into Other NASes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/&quot;&gt;test results&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8hdJTwaTl8I&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, as well as our original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/surreptitiously-swapping-smr-into-hard-drives-must-end/&quot;&gt;Surreptitiously Swapping SMR into Hard Drive Lines Must Stop&lt;/a&gt; piece, we had several readers and folks who watched the previous video and wanted to share their experiences. One that I wanted to highlight was a gentleman by the name of Rob Janssen from the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob reached out via e-mail and was extremely open and helpful sharing his experiences of using the WD Red SMR drives in his new Synology NAS. Rob did a great job in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.robiii.nl/2020/04/wd-red-nas-drives-use-smr-and-im-not.html&quot;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; (note currently HTTP) documenting his experiences with the WD Red DM-SMR drives in his Synology NAS. He talked about how he, like many users, reflexively purchased WD Red because he thought they were the same high-quality drives we have had for generations. He also discussed how after installing his drives, he saw some less than great performance. Here is one example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more than that, he saw strange behavior such as the NAS array working overtime to shuffle data around on the drives even when he would expect it to be idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, WD did the right thing and exchanged his WD Red DM-SMR 6TB drives for WD Red Pro drives. That is a good hint that if you have these drives and are seeing poor performance, you may want to request a swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ZFS Issues Surfaced in Mid-2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob was one of a number of folks who reached out on non-ZFS, but there were other sources pointing to issues with DM-SMR and ZFS. Chris Moore, Super Moderator at the iXsystems forums, even reached out to say how the issue has been thoroughly discussed on the iXsystems FreeNAS forms through a YouTube comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hard things is that this data on personal blogs, and dispersed in forums, is very difficult to corroborate and aggregate. We have a collection of user blogs (Rob’s above, as well as others), and even posts in impacted vendor’s forums not being seen by the general tech community. We had not even seen them for months due to the nature of the issue. That is a big reason consumers rely upon NAS drive vendors, as well as NAS vendors to test and certify drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we are going to talk about how all of this discussion could be missed, and try getting some insight into what WD is doing about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>After GitHub CEO backs Black Lives Matter, workers demand an end to ICE contract</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-06-12/github-ceo-black-lives-matter-employees-demand-end-ice-contract</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-06-12/github-ceo-black-lives-matter-employees-demand-end-ice-contract</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With protests over the police killing of George Floyd gripping the country, Microsoft’s president &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-06-11/microsoft-will-stop-selling-facial-recognition-software-to-police&quot;&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; the company would refrain from selling facial recognition software to police, a small victory for employees who &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://onezero.medium.com/250-microsoft-employees-call-on-ceo-to-cancel-police-contracts-and-support-defunding-seattle-pd-e89fa5d9e843&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; the company sever relationships with law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft-owned GitHub, the parent company’s concession only served to reinvigorate internal opposition to a controversial contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of an all-staff Q&amp;amp;A session Thursday morning, GitHub’s chief executive, Nat Friedman, spoke for around 30 minutes about what he called the “compounding crises” of the global pandemic, surging unemployment and civil unrest over police brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman said GitHub stands firmly with the Black Lives Matter movement and added that the company would look to support law enforcement reform, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his opening remarks, Friedman took his first question from a presenter compiling employee submissions: Can we reconsider GitHub’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for the question. Respectfully, we’re not going to be reconsidering this,” he said on the videoconference call. “Picking and choosing customers is not the approach that we take to these types of questions when it comes to influencing government policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Friedman spoke, dozens of employees expressed frustration and outrage in a company Slack channel with more than 1,200 people, according to screenshots reviewed by The Times. A number of the posters said they viewed the company’s outward stance as clashing with its continued operational support of a government agency that arrests undocumented immigrants at workplaces, schools and hospitals; detains them in harsh and &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/24-immigrants-have-died-ice-custody-during-trump-administration-n1015291&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sometimes life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; conditions; and separates children from their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Friedman’s answer to the initial question, senior application engineer Josh Nichols pushed back with a follow-up: “How does the leadership team rectify GitHub’s position on Black Lives Matter with our continued business with ICE despite their racist practices and policies?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedman responded saying he believes investing in policy changes is a more effective method of driving progress than denying customers and forcing one such as ICE to switch to a competitor such as GitLab or Gitian, according to the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees pushed back on nearly every point Friedman made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he said “it hurts to be not understood in our approach,” multiple employees in the Slack channel responded by saying immigration authorities hurt Black, indigenous and undocumented people more than Friedman could be hurt by opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman compared the dissonance between the company’s stance and employees’ values to a marriage, saying: “I deeply love my wife, but we don’t agree about every single approach to every single problem in the world. But we’re together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least four employees said in Slack messages reviewed by The Times that they found the comparison ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Ballinger, GitHub’s vice president of engineering, posted a message of support for Friedman’s argument, saying his wife does pro bono work on behalf of asylum seekers and other immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I’ve learned from her is that keeping technology from ICE actively harms those vulnerable populations,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees noted that they repeatedly hear this refrain from the company. Raices, a Texas nonprofit that provides legal services to immigrants and refugees, has &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raicestexas/status/1190021443179831297?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously disputed&lt;/a&gt; the claim that immigration advocacy groups want ICE to have better technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, Nichols publicly aired his disappointment with GitHub’s refusal to reconsider its ICE relationship. “The company’s response is confidential, but mine isn’t: continued anger and disappointment,” &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/techpickles/status/1271171425957748743?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nichols tweeted Thursday.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub did not respond to repeated requests for comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thursday meeting is not the first time GitHub has faced ire from employees over law enforcement contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall, employees learned the company had renewed its 2016 contract with ICE. In an &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-10-09/github-ice-contract-employee-oppose&quot;&gt;open letter on Twitter,&lt;/a&gt; employees said continuing to work with ICE would make the company “complicit in widespread human rights abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-10-31/github-ice-contract-defense&quot;&gt;Friedman announced&lt;/a&gt; the company would donate half a million dollars to nonprofits helping communities adversely affected by the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The gesture &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-04/github-open-source-developers-ice-contract&quot;&gt;failed to quell&lt;/a&gt; anger over the issue, which continued to fester and has resulted in the departure of several employees.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Supreme Court declines to hear cases over qualified immunity</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/15/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-cases-over-qualified-immunity.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/15/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-cases-over-qualified-immunity.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;InlineImage-imageEmbed hasBkg&quot; id=&quot;ArticleBody-InlineImage-106577940&quot; data-test=&quot;InlineImage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;InlineImage-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Television crews set up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, June 8, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;41.879310344828&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will not hear cases regarding a doctrine that shields police and other public officials from lawsuits for conduct that does not involve a &quot;clearly established&quot; violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement, made in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061520zor_f2bh.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;, comes as the nation reels from weeks of protests against police violence spurred by the brutal arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month that ended with his death in police custody. The four officers involved in the arrest are now facing charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine, qualified immunity, has come under increasing scrutiny by critics who say it gives blanket protection to law enforcement officers even when they violate civil rights. The burden imposed by qualified immunity on victims of police violence is exacerbated by the fact that prosecutors rarely charge officers for excessive force violations, often leaving civil lawsuits as the only remaining avenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine was established by the Supreme Court in 1982 and has been expanded over time. Increasingly, the top court has required victims to cite a case with precisely the same detailed facts as their own in order to prove that the action against them was a &quot;clearly established&quot; violation of the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Clarence Thomas, one of the court's most ardent conservatives, and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, have both criticized qualified immunity on separate grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas has argued that qualified immunity is essentially a creation of the justices — substituting  &quot;our own policy preferences&quot; for that of Congress. Sotomayor has written that qualified immunity &quot;tells officers that they can shoot first and think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dissent from the court's decision not to hear one of the qualified immunity cases it was considering, Thomas reiterated his opposition to the doctrine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There likely is no basis for the objective inquiry into clearly established law that our modern cases prescribe,&quot; Thomas wrote. &quot;Leading treatises from the second half of the 19th century and case law until the 1980s contain no support for this 'clearly established law' test.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck, while Floyd lay handcuffed and struggling to breathe, has been charged with murder, while the other three officers involved have been charged with aiding and abetting murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Adobe to remove Flash Player from web site after December 2020</title>
<link>https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html</guid>
<description>&lt;li readability=&quot;8.0950639853748&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the Flash Player end-of-life (EOL)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-flash-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; in July 2017, Adobe will stop distributing and updating Flash Player after December 31, 2020 (“EOL Date”). We made this announcement in collaboration with several of our technology partners – including &lt;a href=&quot;https://webkit.org/blog/7839/adobe-announces-flash-distribution-and-updates-to-end/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2017/07/25/Games-Migration-to-Open-Web-Standards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2017/07/25/firefox-roadmap-flash-end-life/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; – which issued complementary announcements with more technical detail on what the Flash Player EOL will mean for developers, enterprises, and consumers using their specific OS environments or browsers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Adobe decide to EOL Flash Player and select the end of 2020 date?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content. Also, the major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Adobe Flash Player).By announcing our business decision in 2017, with three years’ advance notice, we believed that would allow sufficient time for developers, designers, businesses, and other parties to migrate existing Flash content as needed to new, open standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will this decision impact Adobe Flash Player support and distribution for the remainder of the year (2020)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe will continue issuing regular Flash Player security patches, maintain OS and browser compatibility, and add features and capabilities as determined by Adobe through the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

<title>The Sun seen through the Earth in “neutrino light” (2007)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Image of the Sun taken through the Earth, in “neutrino light”, at the Super-Kamiokande detector (Japan). The image has been obtained with a 503 days exposure, by registering neutrinos emitted from the solar core and detected in a 50 000-ton water pool located 1 km underground. At night, neutrinos were transparently traversing the whole earth before being registered in this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imagelink&quot;&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:urchinTracker ('/downloads/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/sun.jpg');&quot; class=&quot;imagelink&quot; title=&quot;The sun seen through the earth in neutrino light&quot; href=&quot;http://strangepaths.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/sun.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image94&quot; alt=&quot;The sun seen through the earth in neutrino light&quot; src=&quot;http://strangepaths.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/sun.thumbnail.jpg&quot; name=&quot;image94&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Click image to zoom&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neutrino is an elementary matter particle of almost zero mass, only interacting through weak nuclear forces and gravity, leading to its unimpeded traveling through ordinary solid matter at almost the speed of light. During a rare interaction between a neutrino and an electron in the water, the electron is accelerated at a speed greater than the speed of light in water, producing a pulse of light -called Cherenkov radiation- similar to a supersonic boom. These pulses are detected by thousands of light amplifiers disposed everywhere on the pool surface.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. Supreme Court endorses gay, transgender worker protections</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-lgbt-idUSKBN23M20N</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-lgbt-idUSKBN23M20N</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday delivered a watershed victory for LGBT rights and a defeat for President Donald Trump’s administration by ruling that a longstanding federal law barring workplace discrimination protects gay and transgender employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landmark 6-3 ruling represented the biggest moment for LGBT rights in the United States since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. Two conservative justices joined the court’s four liberals in the decision: Neil Gorsuch, a 2017 Trump appointee who wrote the ruling, and Chief Justice John Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices decided that gay and transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplace bias against gay and transgender employees had remained legal in much of the country, with 28 U.S. states lacking comprehensive measures against employment discrimination. The ruling - in two gay rights cases from Georgia and New York and a transgender rights case from Michigan - recognizes new worker protections in federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal fight focused on the definition of “sex” in Title VII. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that discriminating against gay and transgender workers was inherently based on their sex and consequently was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump called the ruling very powerful and said, “They’ve ruled and we live with their decision.” Supported by evangelical Christian voters, Trump has taken actions that have undermined gay and transgender rights since taking office in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGBT activists and the only surviving plaintiff in the litigation lauded the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I truly believe I went into shock this morning,” said Gerald Bostock, who brought the Georgia case after losing his job as a county government child welfare services coordinator months after joining the local gay-friendly Hotlanta Softball League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud to have taken part in this process in getting us to this historic moment,” Bostock added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling does not resolve other legal issues on LGBT rights including whether separate federal laws that bar sex discrimination should also be interpreted as covering sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Americans must be able to rely on what the law says, and it is disappointing that a majority of the justices were unwilling to affirm that commonsense principle,” said John Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group that represented the employer in the Michigan case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s administration joined the employers in arguing that Congress did not intend for Title VII to protect gay and transgender people when it passed the law. Gorsuch conceded that point but said what mattered was the law’s text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘A NECESSARY AND UNDISGUISABLE ROLE’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Gorsuch wrote. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20200615&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1522307833&amp;amp;r=LYNXMPEG5E1JD&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;Joseph Fons holding a Pride Flag, runs in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building after the court ruled that a federal law banning workplace discrimination also covers sexual orientation, in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 15, 2020.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorsuch, who signaled sympathy toward the plaintiffs during arguments in the case in October, wrote that “there is no way an employer can discriminate against those who check the homosexual or transgender box without discriminating in part because of an applicant’s sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts, considered the ideological center of the court, backed gay rights in this case after dissenting in the gay marriage ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from Monday’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one word for what the court has done today: legislation,” Alito wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other plaintiffs did not live to see the ruling. Donald Zarda, who sued after being fired as a skydiving instructor in New York, died in 2014. Aimee Stephens, fired by a Detroit funeral home after revealing plans to transition from male to female, died in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign gay rights group, said, “No one should be denied a job or fired simply because of who they are or whom they love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By discriminating against homosexuals,” Gorsuch wrote, “the employer intentionally penalizes men for being attracted to men and women for being attracted to women. By discriminating against transgender persons, the employer unavoidably discriminates against persons with one sex identified at birth and another today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s administration last week issued a rule lifting anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration also has backed the right of certain businesses to refuse to serve gay people on the basis of religious objections, banned most transgender service members from the military and rescinded protections on bathroom access for transgender students in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court faces another test in its next term, which starts in October, in a case pitting LGBT rights against religious rights involving Philadelphia’s decision to bar a Catholic organization from participating in the city’s foster care program because the group will not place children with same-sex couples.&lt;/p&gt;
