<title>1977: Zork</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://if50.substack.com/p/1977-zork</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;a.k.a &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling&lt;br/&gt;First Appeared: late June 1977&lt;br/&gt;First Commercial Release: December 1980&lt;br/&gt;Language: MDL&lt;br/&gt;Platform: PDP-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening Text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;You are in an open field west of a big white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note: contains spoilery discussion of the jeweled egg, cyclops, and robot puzzles.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt; had introduced hackers to an intriguing new genre of immersive text game, &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; was what brought it to the public at large. In the early 1980s, as the personal computer revolution reached into more and more homes, a &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; disk was a must-buy for first-time computer owners. By 1982 it had become the industry’s bestselling game. In 1983, it sold even more copies. &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt; covered it; so did &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, and American astronaut Sally Ride was reportedly obsessed with it. In 1984 it was still topping sales charts, beating out much newer games including its own sequels. At the end of 1985 it was still outselling any other game for the Apple II, half a decade after its first release on the platform, and had become the bestselling title of all time on many other systems besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its creation can be traced to a heady Friday in May 1977 on the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was the last day of finals week, and summer was kicking off with a bang for the school’s cohort of tech-obsessed engineers: a new movie called &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; opened that day in theaters, the groundbreaking Apple II had just been released, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://if50.substack.com/p/1976-adventure&quot;&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was exploding across the terminals of computer labs nationwide, thousands of students having no further distractions, at last, to keep them from solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those obsessive players were four friends at a campus research lab, the Dynamic Modeling Group. Within two weeks they’d solved &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, squeezing every last point from it through meticulous play and, eventually, the surgical deployment of a machine-language debugger. Once the game was definitively solved, they immediately hatched plans to make something better. Not just to prove the superiority of their school’s coding prowess over Don Woods at Stanford—though that was undoubtedly part of it—nor simply because many were dragging their feet on graduating or finding jobs, and a challenging new distraction seemed immensely appealing—though that was part of it too. But the most important factor was that &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt; had been so incredibly &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; and, regrettably, there wasn’t any more of it. “It was like reading a Sherlock Holmes story,” one player &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19990222125344/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html&quot;&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt;, “and you wanted to read another one of them immediately. Only there wasn’t one, because nobody had written it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four friends were an eclectic group of grad students ranging in age from 22 to 28, united by shared sensibilities and a love of hacking. Dave Lebling had a political science degree and had started programming only because of an accidental hole in his freshman year schedule. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXNLWy7rwH4&quot;&gt;“voracious reader”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/12/22/through-the-zorking-glass/8f6fc376-0942-4e66-abb9-06f66a05165c/&quot;&gt;“frustrated writer,”&lt;/a&gt; he’d helped design &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_War&quot;&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in 1973, one of the earliest graphical exploration games and first-person shooters. Marc Blank was young, tall, thin, and technically enrolled in med school, but found messing around with computers an addictive distraction. Bruce Daniels was nearing thirty and increasingly bored with his PhD topic; he’d helped develop the lab’s pet project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/MDL_Programming_Primer.pdf&quot;&gt;the MDL programming language&lt;/a&gt;, and was always eager to find new ways of showing it off. And Tim Anderson was close to finishing his master’s but none too excited about leaving the heady intellectual community at MIT. With &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt; solved, the four sat down to hack together a prototype for an improved version, which would run like the earlier game on a PDP-10 mainframe. Needing a placeholder name for the source file, they typed in &lt;em&gt;zork&lt;/em&gt;, one of many nonsense words floating around campus that could, among other usages, be substituted for an offensive interjection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game they began to create was at first quite similar to &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that historian Jimmy Maher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/01/zork-on-the-pdp-10/&quot;&gt;has noted&lt;/a&gt; parts of it are more remake than homage. Both games begin in a forest outside a house containing supplies for an underground expedition, including food, water, and a light source with limited power; in both you search for treasures in a vast underground cave system and score points by returning them to the building on the surface; both feature underground volcanoes, locked grates, trolls, and a “maze of twisty little passages, all alike.” Hacker tropes and nods to other early text games abound, like a huge bat who whisks you off to another location like in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://if50.substack.com/p/1973-hunt-the-wumpus&quot;&gt;Hunt the Wumpus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But as &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; expanded, it began to develop its own character: less realistic than the caverns sketched from Will Crowther’s real-life experience, but also more whimsical, more threatening, and driven by an improved parser and world model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;open trap door&lt;/strong&gt;
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt;
It is pitch black.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is a grue?&lt;/strong&gt;
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous grues were invented as a solution to a sort of bug: not with the game’s code, but with the player’s suspension of disbelief. In early versions of &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, as in &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, you’d fall into a bottomless pit if you tried to move through a dark room without a portable light source. But someone noticed this could happen in &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; even in the dark attic of the above-ground house. Lebling, stealing the word “grue” from a Jack Vance novel, invented a new and more broadly applicable threat for dark places. The next update reported wryly that Bruce Daniels had spent weeks filling in the dungeon’s old bottomless pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;light lantern&lt;/strong&gt;
The lamp is now on.
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading east, and a crawlway to the south.  On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt;
The door is closed.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;east&lt;/strong&gt;
You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.  Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
The troll's axe barely misses your ear.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The troll is easy enough to dispatch with the “elvish sword of great antiquity” found early on (which glows blue when enemies are near, à la Tolkien). But &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; also featured a more memorable antagonist, a parallel to &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;’s pirate who would pop up from time to time to steal your treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;inventory&lt;/strong&gt;
You are carrying:
A lamp
A sword
A painting
A platinum bar
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;north&lt;/strong&gt;
You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of stairs leads up, and passages leave to the east and west.
There is an extremely valuable (perhaps original) grail here.
Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;get grail&lt;/strong&gt;
Taken.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;kill thief&lt;/strong&gt;
Your stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade.
The thief slowly approaches, strikes like a snake, and leaves you wounded.
The other occupant just left, still carrying his large bag.  You may not have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;inventory&lt;/strong&gt;
You are carrying:
A lamp
A sword
&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thief was more sophisticated than &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;’s pirate. Not only does he steal treasure, he wanders the map at will, sometimes picking up other items he finds and discarding them later when he loses interest. Sometimes he’ll ignore the player, but often he’ll lash out first with his stiletto: fighting back is ineffectual early on, but as the player’s score goes up—from returning more and more treasure to the surface—combat becomes progressively easier. The thief also had a more subtle role to play in one of the game’s most confounding puzzles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches.  The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
On the branch is a small birds nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely fragile.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;get egg&lt;/strong&gt;
Taken.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;open it&lt;/strong&gt;
There is no obvious way to open the egg.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player can smash the egg, revealing a golden clockwork canary inside, but doing so damages both items and renders them worthless. No command or tool exists that lets the player open the egg without ruining it. The correct solution, counter to all adventuring instincts, is to &lt;em&gt;let the thief steal the egg&lt;/em&gt;. Later, once the player gains enough experience to defeat him, he can be tracked to his lair at the heart of the maze and dispatched. Found amidst his treasures are the canary and the opened egg, undamaged. The implication helps characterize the thief and gives him a hint of an inner life: an insatiable curiosity, and an unparalleled expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thief, along with the rest of &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, evolved in a way that few previous text games had: through continuous interaction with an active player base. (1975’s PLATO game &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://if50.substack.com/p/1975-dnd&quot;&gt;dnd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was a notable earlier example.) The PDP-10 on which the game lived ran a homegrown operating system called ITS—the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System&quot;&gt;Incompatible Timesharing System&lt;/a&gt;, in reference to an earlier and much-derided “Compatible” OS. Part of the hacker ethos in the 1970s was that information should be maximally free, and to that end the developers of ITS had made it an entirely open system, with no modern notions of security or privacy. No passwords, no superusers: anyone could view and run anyone else’s files, or watch what was happening on any connected user’s terminal. This permissiveness spread even to remote users connecting to an ITS system over the ARPANET. And this meant net spelunkers could discover &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, even without its creators publicly announcing it or promoting it, simply by logging into the Dynamic Modeling Group’s PDP-10 and watching what its users were up to. Much like devs in the 2010s livestreaming game development on Twitch, distant spectators could watch &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s creators test and play their game in real-time, as they were making it. It wasn’t long before the spectators figured out how to launch the unfinished game themselves and begin their own expeditions into the Great Underground Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thirst for a new &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt; was intense, and &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, though still unfinished, became so popular its creators set up an official email list for its players. They also used an in-game newspaper called the US News &amp;amp; Dungeon Report (found in the living room of the white house) to advertise the latest fixes and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;When an error is encountered in this version, you will be asked for a description of the problem immediately, just as if you had used the ‘bug’ command.  We hope that this will improve the handling of such problems.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;A reminder that save files created before 1/17 will not work in this version; fortunately, the program is clever enough to figure out whether a particular save file can be used or not.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;In addition to ‘take foo and bar’, the parser now claims to understand things like ‘take foo and read bar’, ‘take foo and read it’, and so on.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s parser represented another improvement over &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. While the earlier game could only understand inputs of two words at a time—a verb and a noun—&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; added support for multi-word verbs and nouns like &lt;em&gt;look under&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;trap door,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the concept of both a direct and indirect object, enabling commands that simply hadn’t previously been possible such as &lt;em&gt;attack troll with sword&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;put jewels in sack&lt;/em&gt;. As time went on, the team added pronouns, articles, and the ability to chain multiple commands together or refer to groups of objects more selectively, eventually touting that their parser could understand a command as complex as &lt;em&gt;put all of the valuables except the torch and the coin into the trophy case&lt;/em&gt;. While inputs this long were rare in practice, the new parser’s smarts lent it a certain mystique it would never entirely shed, making &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s possibility space seem even more unbounded. “I’m not sure it can be solved,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1981-08/80Microcomputing_0881#page/n31/mode/2up&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; one overwhelmed reviewer: “there is so much in it and the possibilities seem staggering.” &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s creators &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060206224137/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/ieee.html&quot;&gt;had written&lt;/a&gt; about how their program could “simulate enough of the universe to appear to be more intelligent than it really is,” and a parser whose capabilities were less easy to understand was a key part of that illusion of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a mainframe’s generous space, &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s creators were free to keep expanding their game and riddling it with more and more responses to unexpected inputs, often indulging in their idiosyncratic sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;
Naturally!&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;eat money&lt;/strong&gt;
Talk about eating rich foods!&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;count leaves&lt;/strong&gt;
There are 69,105 leaves here.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite their philosophical commitment to the open model of ITS, the team recognized that a fundamental appeal of Adventure-likes was their ability to surprise you with unexpected messages, as well as provide challenging puzzles—“problems,” as the team called them—which would be spoiled if players could view the game’s source code. They hacked ITS to prevent access to the one folder containing &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s secrets. One clever user nevertheless found a way to download the forbidden files; the MIT team was so impressed with his technique they weren’t even angry. The purloined game, then entitled &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; (the creators had briefly changed the name before reverting it in 1978) found its way to Bob Supnik of DEC, the makers of the PDP-10; Supnik kept the &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; name and ported the game to Fortran. It would proliferate through various systems on a parallel but distinct trajectory to the official &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, and was how many outside the PDP/ARPANET ecosystem would first encounter it—including the authors of the first multi-user &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, known as &lt;em&gt;MUD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pilfering the source code had been something of a meta-puzzle, adding new official problems for the growing fan community kept the team busy through 1978 and into early 1979. Implementing them often required extending &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s core engine, expanding the codebase to support simulating and understanding more and more things. Vehicles were added which could be entered and steered through rooms; a more robust combat system inspired by &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; worked its way into the game; an entire sliding-block puzzle maze of moving rooms showed up. In one area, the player finds a trapped treasure that seems impossible to retrieve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall is a small sticker which says
                     Protected by
                       FROBOZZ
                 Magic Alarm Company
                  (Hello, footpad!)

There is a beautiful crystal sphere here.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;take sphere&lt;/strong&gt;
As you reach for the sphere, a steel cage falls from the ceiling to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming into the room.      &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there is no escape from the cage, a player who dies and tries again can find nearby something rather incongruous, for a dungeon: a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;       !!!!  FROBOZZ MAGIC ROBOT COMPANY !!!!

Hello, Master!
   
   I am a late-model robot, trained at MIT Tech to perform various simple household functions. 

Instructions for use:
   To activate me, use the following formula:
        &amp;gt;TELL ROBOT '&amp;lt;something to do&amp;gt;' &amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;
   The quotation marks are required!&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to instruct the robot to follow you into the room with the sphere, and lift the cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;tell robot 'go east'&lt;/strong&gt;
Done.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;east&lt;/strong&gt;
Machine Room
There is a robot here.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;tell robot 'go south'&lt;/strong&gt;
Done.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;south&lt;/strong&gt;
Dingy Closet
There is a robot here.
There is a beautiful white crystal sphere here.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;get sphere&lt;/strong&gt;
As you reach for the sphere, a steel cage falls from the ceiling to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming into the room.      
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;tell robot 'lift cage'&lt;/strong&gt;
The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;take sphere&lt;/strong&gt;
Taken.
&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;north&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though each of these new innovations were only used in one or two places—the robot can’t help you solve puzzles outside of its own small area—each were programmed as reusable, abstract systems, not special-case exceptions. Its creators, in short, built a reusable engine. In later years when they’d found a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://infocom-if.org/company/company.html&quot;&gt;Infocom&lt;/a&gt; and start selling text adventures commercially, this would prove incredibly useful. A robot that could understand orders and carry out actions, for instance, would become the basis for an entire future game, &lt;em&gt;Suspended&lt;/em&gt; (1983), which would exercise the concept in a much more thorough and thought-provoking way. The parser and its world model could be copied over for each new game, continuously improved but largely providing a stable platform on which to build more interesting work. Instead of continually rebuilding the stage, they could start to focus on the stories one might tell on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; is more remembered today for its pride of place than its actual gameplay. Scholar Nick Montfort praises its innovations, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/twisty-little-passages&quot;&gt;calls it&lt;/a&gt; “a very early and rough effort” that’s “not a masterwork by today’s standards.” A 21st-century reviewer &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050426151251/http://www.ministryofpeace.com/if-review/reviews/20010629.html&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that it “wants nothing more than to see you fail, and it’s not overly concerned with how much fun you might be having.” The game’s worldbuilding was a bit of a mess, putting robots alongside elvish swords, Alice in Wonderland puzzles near a mechanized flood control dam, and underground chasms beside underground broom closets. It populates an otherwise eerie Land of the Dead with gratuitous hacker in-jokes. &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s “problems” could be arbitrary or unfair: the way to defeat a cyclops is to scare him off by saying the name of his rival Odysseus, something few players would think to try. Many puzzles (including that one) did have &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrogeekery.com/how-to-play-and-beat-zork-a-step-by-step-walkthrough/&quot;&gt;alternate solutions&lt;/a&gt;. But a player base consisting almost entirely of university hackers expected challenging problems: too simple, and they would have stopped playing. Today’s games are made for broader audiences used to far less friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; was massively successful in its own right and as a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, a second draft of sorts that more fully explored the possibilities inherent in the new kind of game Crowther and Woods had prototyped. In February 1979, &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s creators declared it finished in part because they had run out of room to keep building: the MDL language only supported an address space of 256,000 36-bit words—roughly a megabyte of text and code—and the game had brushed up against that limit. It had expanded to include nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://almy.us/image/DungeonMap.png&quot;&gt;two hundred rooms&lt;/a&gt;, a vocabulary of nine hundred words, thirty-one treasures to collect, and a challenging endgame for master explorers. Its creators had also been stretching the limits of their welcome at MIT, several long-since graduated and unsure what they wanted to do next. With a handful of other alums and faculty, some would found Infocom and run it at first out of their living rooms and apartments, not even getting a P.O. Box until nine months later. Though they had vague hopes of making some kind of business software, their first commercial product would be a program they already had on hand: &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;. There would be significant challenges in squeezing the massive mainframe game into the minuscule capabilities of the first generation of personal computers, but the team would overcome them (in part by splitting the game into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/o5MAAOSw0oFe5o7p/s-l1600.jpg&quot;&gt;trilogy&lt;/a&gt;) and the rest would be history. Infocom would become one of the most legendary text game studios of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; is noteworthy for more than just its commercial success. When the Library of Congress decided in 2007 to start archiving games with cultural significance, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/arts/design/12vide.html&quot;&gt;one of the first ten selected&lt;/a&gt;. Influencing the aesthetics of games for a generation, leaving behind tropes like grues and brass lanterns, it would also provide an enduring technical foundation for future text game creators. After Infocom’s demise, its engine would be reverse-engineered by fans to become the platform for the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Inform&quot;&gt;Inform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://inform7.com/&quot;&gt;Inform 7&lt;/a&gt; design languages, letting new generations of creators keep exploring the possibility space it had opened up. Today thousands and thousands of games have been written that run in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Z-machine&quot;&gt;Z-machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s engine. “A sufficiently imaginative person or persons could probably do this indefinitely,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060206224137/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/ieee.html&quot;&gt;the team wrote&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 about the idea of using &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s framework to write new games, with no idea how prophetic those words would become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;’s creators were thrilled about the new genre they helped popularize, which years later would become known as interactive fiction. Dave Lebling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXNLWy7rwH4&quot;&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; the joy of merging two great passions: “the idea of combining writing and programming, it was like—Wow! How can I do this for my whole life?” As the years went on they became starry-eyed about their new medium’s potential, increasingly aware they were circling the edges of something more than a new kind of amusing diversion. It had the potential to be a whole new kind of art. But as they declared their game finished on that cold February day in 1979, they had no inkling yet of the explosive spring and heady summer to come: of how much work was left to do. “We were learning how to write adventure games,” Lebling wistfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXdmo2j_CiQ&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;, “and it took a long time to learn to do them better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week: the story of the husband and wife team who founded the first successful computer game studio—a year before Ken and Roberta Williams founded theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.542310/gov.uscourts.nysd.542310.243.0_2.pdf&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Citibank isn't entitled to the return of $500 million it sent to various creditors last August. Kludgey software and a poorly designed user interface contributed to the massive screwup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank was acting as an agent for Revlon, which owed hundreds of millions of dollars to various creditors. On August 11, Citibank was supposed to send out interest payments totaling $7.8 million to these creditors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Revlon was in the process of refinancing its debt—paying off a few creditors while rolling the rest of its debt into a new loan. And this, combined with the confusing interface of financial software called Flexcube, led the bank to accidentally pay back the principal on the entire loan—most of which wasn't due until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how Judge Jesse Furman describes the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Flexcube, the easiest (or perhaps only) way to execute the transaction—to pay the Angelo Gordon Lenders their share of the principal and interim interest owed as of August 11, 2020, and then to reconstitute the 2016 Term Loan with the remaining Lenders—was to enter it in the system as if paying off the loan in its entirety, thereby triggering accrued interest payments to all Lenders, but to direct the principal portion of the payment to a &quot;wash account&quot;—&quot;an internal Citibank account... to help ensure that money does not leave the bank.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India. He was presented with a Flexcube screen that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-11.35.28-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;411&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Judge Jesse Furman&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcontractor thought that checking the &quot;principal&quot; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, the subcontractor actually needed to set the &quot;front&quot; and &quot;fund&quot; fields to the wash account as well as &quot;principal.&quot; The subcontractor didn't do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad_wrapper&quot; aria-label=&quot;In Content advertisement&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad_notice&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citibank's procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was the subcontractor, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware. All three believed that setting the &quot;principal&quot; field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, the Delaware supervisor wrote: &quot;looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revlon’s creditors were delighted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the principal wasn't going to wash. When the subcontractor conducted a routine review the next morning, he noticed there was something drastically off about the previous day's figures. Citibank had actually sent out almost $900 million, not the $7.8 million it was trying to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank then scrambled to get the funds back, notifying each creditor that the principal payments had been made by mistake. Some of the creditors sent the money back. But others refused, leaving Citibank out $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, paying back a loan early wouldn't be a big deal, since the parties could simply negotiate a new loan on similar terms. But in this case, some of the lenders were not on good terms with Revlon and Citibank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, as the pandemic was accelerating, Revlon experienced financial difficulties and sought to borrow more money. To do that, Revlon convinced a majority of its previous creditors to allow it to transfer collateral from its old loan to a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong-arm tactic angered the other creditors, who felt that the reduced collateral could leave them holding the bag if Revlon ran out of money. That's more than a theoretical concern: Bloomberg's Matt Levine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Revlon's debt is &quot;trading at around 42 cents on the dollar.&quot; But under the terms of the loan, the minority lenders didn't have a way to force early repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Citibank's screwup allowed Revlon's creditors to claw back cash that it might otherwise have never gotten back. And it could leave Revlon in a precarious financial situation if the company can't get the money back from the old lenders and can't find new lenders willing to replace the funds. Though given its screwup, Citibank could possibly end up as Revlon's new creditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad_wrapper&quot; aria-label=&quot;In Content advertisement&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad_notice&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The judge ruled against Citibank&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank sued, arguing that it was entitled to get the money back since the cash was sent out by mistake. Ordinarily, the law would be on Citibank's side here. Under New York law, someone who sends out an erroneous wire transfer—for example, sending a payment to the wrong account—is entitled to get the money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the law makes an exception when a debtor accidentally wires money to a creditor. In that case, if the creditor doesn't have prior knowledge the payment was a mistake, it's free to treat it as a repayment of the loan. Judge Furman ruled that that principle applies here, even though Citibank notified its creditors of the mistake the very next day. The defendants noted that the amounts they received matched the amounts Revlon owed down to the penny, making it reasonable for them to assume it was an early repayment of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furman also argued that it was reasonable for the creditors to assume that a bank as sophisticated as Citibank wouldn't send out such a large amount of money by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion—would have been borderline irrational,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case isn't over, however. Furman has ordered the creditors to keep the funds in escrow to give Citibank time to appeal his ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We strongly disagree with this decision and intend to appeal,&quot; Citibank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/business/citibank-revlon-lawsuit-ruling/index.html&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nvidia announces mining GPUs, cuts the hash rate of RTX-3060 in half</title>
<link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/18/geforce-cmp/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/18/geforce-cmp/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;bsf-rt-reading-time&quot;/&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;bsf_rt_marker&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;has-content-area&quot; data-url=&quot;https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/18/geforce-cmp/&quot; data-title=&quot;GeForce Is Made for Gaming, CMP Is Made to Mine&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are gamers, through and through. We obsess about new gaming features, new architectures, new games and tech. We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet NVIDIA GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on Feb. 25, we’re taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halving Hash Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That only makes sense. Our GeForce RTX GPUs introduce cutting-edge technologies — such as RTX real-time ray-tracing, DLSS AI-accelerated image upscaling technology, Reflex super-fast response rendering for the best system latency, and many more — tailored to meet the needs of gamers and those who create digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the specific needs of Ethereum mining, we’re announcing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/&quot;&gt;NVIDIA CMP&lt;/a&gt;, or, Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, product line for professional mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMP products — which don’t do graphics — are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They don’t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, don’t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, CMP lacks display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating tailored products for customers with specific needs delivers the best value for customers. With CMP, we can help miners build the most efficient data centers while preserving GeForce RTX GPUs for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Global debt soars to 356% of GDP</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/global-debt-gdp-898959ed-f96a-4c4d-85a3-5d3cc419631f.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/global-debt-gdp-898959ed-f96a-4c4d-85a3-5d3cc419631f.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The world's debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 356% in 2020, a new report from the Institute of International Finance finds, up 35 percentage points from where it stood in 2019, as countries saw their economies shrink and issued an ocean of debt to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The increase brings numerous countries, including the U.S., to extreme debt levels, well beyond what economists have called untenable in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nonfinancial private sector debt alone now makes up 165% of the entire world's economic output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The upswing was well beyond the rise seen during the 2008 global financial crisis,&quot; IIF economists said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Back in 2008 and 2009, the increase in global debt ratio was limited to 10 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Global debt increased to $281 trillion last year, with total private and public sector debt rising by $24 trillion in the 61 countries IIF follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That rise accounts for more than a quarter of the $88 trillion increase in debt that has been accumulated over the past decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government debt accounts for 105% of global GDP, up from 88% in 2019, rising by $12 trillion in 2020 or nearly triple its $4.3 trillion increase in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt in the financial sector rose by more than 5 percentage points to 86% of GDP in 2020. This was the largest increase since 2007 and the first annual increase since 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the debt matters:&lt;/strong&gt; While worries about significantly pushing up inflation and borrowing costs have not come to pass, slow growth and diminishing returns have, and the world's already high debt levels look to be inhibiting economic growth and threaten to hold back a full recovery from the pandemic in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further, almost all of the debt issued in 2020 was to deal with present circumstances rather than to invest in forward-looking projects or growth, making future investments in such projects more difficult and potentially more costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where it stands:&lt;/strong&gt; The CBO projected U.S. GDP growth over the next 10 years will be largely below 2% (with the notable exclusion of 2021), and that annual budget deficits will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The federal debt is set to exceed the size of the economy this year for only the second time since the end of World War II and grow to 107% of GDP by 2031.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That projection was made without including President Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>I am a heroin user. I do not have a drug problem</title>
<link>http://m.nautil.us/issue/96/rewired/i-am-a-heroin-user-i-do-not-have-a-drug-problem</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://m.nautil.us/issue/96/rewired/i-am-a-heroin-user-i-do-not-have-a-drug-problem</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;arl Hart is a neuroscientist and Ziff Professor of Psychology at Columbia University—he was the first tenured African-American professor of sciences at Columbia. His research focuses on the “behavioral and neuropharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs in humans.” Hart’s new book, &lt;em&gt;Drug Use For Grown-Ups&lt;/em&gt;, is a bold and engaging effort to counter what he sees as generations of misinformation and moral grandstanding about drug use. Today’s “sensationalistic media coverage of the opioid crisis continues a long, awful tradition of exploiting ignorance and fear to vilify certain members of our society,” Hart writes. The media is not the only problem. Scientists, he states, “have frequently overinterpreted and distorted” drugs’ effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hart reports that more than 70 percent of drug users—whether they use alcohol, cocaine, prescription medications, or heroin—do not meet the health criteria for drug addiction. In &lt;em&gt;Drug Use for Grown-Ups&lt;/em&gt;, Hart strives to “present a more realistic image of the typical drug user: a responsible professional who happens to use drugs in his pursuit of happiness.” With genial candor, Hart presents himself as a model drug user. “I am now entering my fifth year as a regular heroin user,” he writes. “I do not have a drug-use problem. Never have. Each day, I meet my parental, personal, and professional responsibilities. I pay my taxes, serve as a volunteer in my community on a regular basis, and contribute to the global community as an informed and engaged citizen. I am better for my drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; caught up with Hart to discuss his drug use and his sharp points about science and society. He was as casually bold in conversation as he is in &lt;em&gt;Drug Use for Grown-Ups&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/18174_0f004440ba0c8f1ccc5c355f3d77207f.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HABIT OF A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PERSON:&lt;/strong&gt; “My heroin use is as rational as my alcohol use,” Carl Hart writes. “Like vacation, sex, and the arts, heroin is one of the tools that I use to maintain my work-life balance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Carl Hart&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say “most drug-use scenarios cause little or no harm and that some responsible drug-use scenarios are actually beneficial for human health and functioning.” How so?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just talk about alcohol first. When you’re at a wedding reception, alcohol serves as a social lubricant. People are more gregarious. They talk, they interact. The same is true with cocaine at parties, heroin among friends, or opium among friends, NDMA among lovers. It enhances empathy, openness, and forgiveness, all of these pro-social attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug research, you write, is full of bad science. If you had to name one example, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that drug addiction is a brain disease. That encapsulates all that’s wrong with today’s science in this area. There is absolutely no data in humans to show that drug addiction is a brain disease. Yet the narrative, the dogma, the dominant perspective is that it does. Even though nobody will dispute that, there’s absolutely no data in humans to support that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet opioids do change the brain biologically, do they not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, opioids bind to a class of receptors called endogenous opioids, which you find in endorphins, for example. Opioids bind to these receptors—just like natural chemicals do—which results in a response. In some cases, because of decreased sensitivities and certain types of pain, they may enhance a sense of euphoria. So it’s really just facilitating what’s already in the body naturally, a system that helps in our survival. Think of fructose or glucose. We add sugar to our tea, our coffee, whatever we have, we add more and more because we like it, it tastes good, and it enhances pleasure. It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone. And so sometimes we do these things, and that’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People become addicted because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have scientists “overinterpreted and distorted” the effects of drugs on the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take brain imaging. People often show one image of someone’s brain. Let’s say this person is addicted to methamphetamine, according to DSM criteria, versus the brain of someone who’s not addicted. If you see some difference, some researchers have a propensity to make more out of the differences than are there. There’s a wide range of brain structural sizes, such that when we think about one person’s size of their nucleus accumbens, it may be smaller or larger than somebody else’s nucleus accumbens. But both of the nucleus accumbens, despite their sizes, are within the normal range of human variability. It’s like height. One guy might be 5’10”, another guy might be 6’2”. But we don’t say the guy who’s 5’10” is height deficient. We just say that he’s in a normal range, and he’s not as tall as the other guy. We wouldn’t say one is deficient versus the other. In neuroscience, one of the things that has happened, particularly when it comes to drugs, people have over-interpreted the differences to mean pathology, when, in fact, both of the brain structures are within the normal range of human variability. The overinterpretation is to interpret it as being pathological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say the opioid crisis has been sensationalized, and write, “People are not dying because of opioids; they are dying because of ignorance.” What do you mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don’t know not to mix specific sedatives with opioids. For example, they don’t know not to mix large amounts of alcohol or large amounts of antihistamines. Specific combinations can lead to respiratory depression, which can lead to death. Another point of ignorance involves people who buy street drugs and don’t necessarily know if the drugs contain contaminants. That’s the kind of ignorance I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Moheb Costandi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home is more than a place on a map. It evokes a particular set of feelings, and a sense of safety and belonging. Location, memories, and emotions are intertwined within those walls. Over the past few decades, this sentiment has...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/issue/8/Home/emotional-renovations&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;emotional-renovations&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it’s the mix of drugs that is the problem, not opioids like heroin themselves? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the majority of opioid deaths occur as a result of combining opioids with multiple sedatives. But there are certain opioids that do concern us if taken alone and the person isn’t aware that they have this particular opioid. Those are fentanyl and the fentanyl analogs. These drugs are a lot more potent than something like heroin, meaning they require less of it to produce the effect. Most of the public aren’t seeking fentanyl or its analogs, but people are tainting things like heroin and oxycodone pills with fentanyl or an analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to deal with this tainting, this contamination, is to have free drug-checking facilities, where people can submit samples of their drug and get a chemical readout of what is contained in the substance. That way they’ll know whether to take the substance or how much of it to take. The public also needs to know that most people who use these drugs are not addicts. If you understand that, then you know that for the people who do become addicted, we have to look beyond the drug and look at the person’s environment, their life. Do they have co-occurring psychiatric illnesses? Do they have pain that is not treated? All of these kinds of issues become important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what point does biological change in the brain lead to physical addiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical addiction occurs as a result of opioids—or any other drug, alcohol too—being in the body for consecutive weeks or periods, in particularly high doses. And then the body tries to compensate. For example, with opioids, one of the things that happens is that your gut, your gastrointestinal system, slows down the receptors. Your body is trying to compensate by speeding up the gastrointestinal tract. So when the drug abruptly leaves after several weeks of constant administration of the opioid, now the body is unprepared for the drug not being there and it overcompensates. It really ramps up the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, which causes diarrhea, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do some people get addicted and not others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of drugs they take, the period at which they take it. Some people can take opioids for extended periods of time. As long as they keep the doses fairly low and they don’t take multiple doses a day, they probably won’t experience physical dependence. It’s just like with alcohol. Most people drink alcohol on a regular basis, but they don’t become physically dependent. Whereas others drink every day in large amounts, and they will become physically dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t people overcome addiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major reasons people can’t overcome it is because we’re not very good at treating addiction in this country. Just think about why people become addicted. A large number become addicted because of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses, because of pain issues, because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their home, someone in their community. Those jobs are gone. Then there’s no healthcare or there’s poor education. If your treatment is not addressing these issues, people are not going to overcome it. But if we have treatments that are holistic, and they’re looking at the individual, and not so much the drug, then we’re good. But if we’re just talking about the drug, then we’re already behind the eight ball, then we will lose that battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your definition of addiction follows the DSM-5, which refers to a “substance use disorder” and values functioning over regular ingestion of a substance. How do you define “functioning”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functioning is determined by whether a user is happy in meeting their obligations, whatever they may be, whether they’re work-related, whether they’re family-related, or other social sorts of things. The person is not stressed out about their substance use. In fact, they’re cool with it. That’s functioning. The person’s happiness is more important. That supersedes any other thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write that, contrary to the cultural myth, regular use of recreational drugs doesn’t damage the brain. What’s the frequency associated with recreational?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m sorry. I couldn’t think of a better term. I don’t really like that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try another one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know a term. I simply mean people who take drugs, like alcohol users, somebody who may have a glass of wine or two every night for dinner, whereas somebody else may only drink on the weekend. It’s a wide range. And the same can be true with cocaine or heroin. That’s what I mean. People are functioning and don’t have these psychosocial disruptions. They’re meeting their obligations. They’re happy with their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that drug addiction is a brain disease encapsulates all that’s wrong with today’s science in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write, “Despite the current false narrative, the addiction rate among people prescribed opioids for pain in the United States, for example, ranges from less than 1 percent to 8 percent.” Why do we have that false narrative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It serves many purposes. It allows for the “war on drugs.” It allows for people to be moralistic; for treatment providers to have a &lt;em&gt;raison d’etre&lt;/em&gt;. And what would the media have to write about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the context of the opioid crisis, might your arguments supporting opioid use be used by drug makers to defend themselves in court?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think they can because they’re being sued for minimizing the addiction potential of oxycodone preparations. It’s clear how they were supposed to inform the public, and it’s clear what they did. They were just not as forthright as they should have been. They were forthright with morphine, so why not be forthright with oxycodone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you use heroin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s like saying, “Why do you use alcohol?” For the same reasons: a social lubricant, alter my consciousness. It’s a lot less toxic on my liver than alcohol and it’s really good at producing euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you get the heroin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no one’s business. I would only say it’s always tested for quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write that heroin has made you a better person. How?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps me to think about the impact of my behavior on other people, and then make the appropriate adjustments where I may have caused people harm, or anguish, or anxiety, stress. I try to rectify that. It’s a great solace in that way, it helps me to be patient with people—to be all the things that we hope our children will be. That’s what I’m trying to do. And it helps me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your book, you describe the death of your dog, Kenya. You note that in those moments after the veterinarian arrived to put the dog down, you got caught up in what drugs were going to be used to put him down, and that enabled you to escape the very strong emotions you were feeling. I wondered if that has a broader significance in your experience with drugs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a hard thing to say. I’m a typical American male. I mean typical in the sense that we’ve been all lied to about hiding our emotions. They’re forcing us to not emote and forcing us not to express pain, and hurt, and all of those kinds of things. And so thinking about drugs, in my learning about drugs, has been a way to avoid dealing with the emotions that are there and that are appropriate for humans to express. And that’s what that scene with Kenya was. I was trying to illustrate that I’ve been screwed up like many American males by not facing my emotions, by not sharing my emotions, by pretending that I’m hard and emotionless. And that’s not healthy for a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write that only “healthy, responsible adults” should use recreational drugs. Who should decide who is the healthy, responsible adult? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent point. Certainly not me. I was really trying to make the point that I was writing the book for grown-ups. And I was trying to say that just because you’re 18 or 21, whatever, it doesn’t mean you’re grown-up. Part of being grown up is you have this freedom, but with freedom comes responsibility. And that’s the point I was trying to illustrate. I can’t decide. We think about somebody who’s driving an automobile. There are a lot of irresponsible people who drive automobiles, but we do our best to make sure they are a certain age, that we have speed limits, that people wear seatbelts, that they pass some competency exam. We have all of these things in place to try and help us, to serve as proxies. But we really don’t know. And I certainly don’t know who’s the grown-up. And I certainly don’t think that we should have some person sitting there deciding who’s a grown-up, because it gives us an opportunity to exclude other people. Lord knows I don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your birthright to use drugs is part of the pursuit of happiness, you write. But others might say, “It’s my birthright not to take vaccines, not to wear a COVID-19 mask, to storm the Capitol.” Has “my” pursuit of happiness become dangerously exclusive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s great. That’s good. We have those birthrights as long as we don’t prevent others from pursuing their rights. When you’re infringing on other people’s rights, then you no longer have those rights. But as long as you’re not disrupting other people’s ability to pursue their rights, then, cool. If you’re not wearing a mask, when we have this highly communicable disease, then you’re potentially impacting the rights of other people. I think of my birthright as the basis of my liberty to control my body, and put what I want in my body as long as I’m not interfering with other people’s ability to do the same. I am allowed to pursue happiness as I see fit, as long as I’m not disrupting other people’s ability to do the same. And that’s part of the responsibility that’s required of anybody who is exercising these rights.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Those who know about us have power over us. Obfuscation may be our best digital weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By: Finn Brunton &amp;amp; Helen Nissenbaum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Consider a day in the life of a fairly ordinary person in a large city in a stable, democratically governed country. She is not in prison or institutionalized, nor is she a dissident or an enemy of the state, yet she lives in a condition of permanent and total surveillance unprecedented in its precision and intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as she leaves her apartment, she is on camera: while in the hallway and the elevator of her building, when using the ATM outside her bank, while passing shops and waiting at crosswalks, while in the subway station and on the train — and all that before lunch. A montage of nearly every move of her life in the city outside her apartment could be assembled, and each step accounted for. But that montage would hardly be necessary: Her mobile phone, in the course of its ordinary operation of seeking base stations and antennas to keep her connected as she walks, provides a constant log of her position and movements. Her apps are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;keeping tabs&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time she spends in “dead zones” without phone reception can also be accounted for: Her subway pass logs her entry into the subway, and her radio-frequency identification badge produces a record of her entry into the building in which she works. (If she drives a car, her electronic toll-collection pass serves a similar purpose, as does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/02/license-plate-data-is-big-business/18370791/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;automatic license-plate imaging&lt;/a&gt;.) If her apartment is part of a smart-grid program, spikes in her electricity usage can reveal exactly when she is up and around, turning on lights and ventilation fans and using the microwave oven and the coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely some of the fault must lie with this individual for using services or engaging with institutions that offer unfavorable terms of service and are known to misbehave. Isn’t putting all the blame on government institutions and private services unfair, when they are trying to maintain security and capture some of the valuable data produced by their users? Can’t we users just opt out of systems with which we disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we return to the question of opting out, consider how thoroughly the systems mentioned are embedded in our hypothetical ordinary person’s everyday life, far more invasively than mere logs of her daily comings and goings. Someone observing her could assemble in forensic detail her social and familial connections, her struggles and interests, and her beliefs and commitments. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amazon purchases&lt;/a&gt; and Kindle highlights, from purchase records linked with her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43483426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;loyalty cards at the drugstore&lt;/a&gt; and the supermarket, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/10/heres-a-tool-to-see-what-your-email-metadata-reveals-about-you/#1121fec2d252&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gmail metadata&lt;/a&gt; and chat logs, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/even-if-you-cleared-your-history-google-records-your-search-activity-2018-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search history&lt;/a&gt; and checkout records from the public library, from Netflix-streamed movies, and from activity on Facebook and Twitter, dating sites, and other social networks, a very specific and personal narrative is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the apparatus of total surveillance that we have described here were deliberate, centralized, and explicit, a Big Brother machine toggling between cameras, it would demand revolt, and we could conceive of a life outside the totalitarian microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the apparatus of total surveillance that we have described here were deliberate, centralized, and explicit, a Big Brother machine toggling between cameras, it would demand revolt, and we could conceive of a life outside the totalitarian microscope. But if we are nearly as observed and documented as any person in history, our situation is a prison that, although it has no walls, bars, or wardens, is difficult to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the problem of “opting out.” For all the dramatic language about prisons and panopticons, the sorts of data collection we describe here are, in democratic countries, still theoretically voluntary. But the costs of refusal are high and getting higher: A life lived in social isolation means living far from centers of business and commerce, without access to many forms of credit, insurance, or other significant financial instruments, not to mention the minor inconveniences and disadvantages — long waits at road toll cash lines, higher prices at grocery stores, inferior seating on airline flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t possible for everyone to live on principle; as a practical matter, many of us must make compromises in asymmetrical relationships, without the control or consent for which we might wish. In those situations — everyday 21st-century life — there are still ways to carve out spaces of resistance, counterargument, and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded by examples of obfuscation that we do not yet think of under that name. Lawyers engage in overdisclosure, sending mountains of vaguely related client documents in hopes of burying a pertinent detail. Teenagers on social media — surveilled by their parents — will conceal a meaningful communication to a friend in a throwaway line or a song title surrounded by banal chatter. Literature and history provide many instances of “collective names,” where a population took a single identifier to make attributing any action or identity to a particular person impossible, from the fictional “I am Spartacus” to the real “Poor Conrad” and “Captain Swing” in prior centuries — and “Anonymous,” of course, in ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can apply obfuscation in our own lives by using practices and technologies that make use of it, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The secure browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which (among other anti-surveillance technologies) muddles our Internet activity with that of other Tor users, concealing our trail in that of many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser plugins &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackmenot.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TrackMeNot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adnauseam.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdNauseam&lt;/a&gt;, which explore obfuscation techniques by issuing many fake search requests and loading and clicking every ad, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://bengrosser.com/projects/go-rando/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Go Rando&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly chooses your emotional “reactions” on Facebook, interfering with their emotional profiling and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playful experiments like Adam Harvey’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ahprojects.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HyperFace” project&lt;/a&gt;, finding patterns on textiles that fool facial recognition systems – not by hiding your face, but by creating the illusion of many faces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;If obfuscation has an emblematic animal, it is the family of orb-weaving spiders, &lt;em&gt;Cyclosa mulmeinensis&lt;/em&gt;, which fill their webs with decoys of themselves. The decoys are far from perfect copies, but when a wasp strikes they work well enough to give the orb-weaver a second or two to scramble to safety. At its most abstract, obfuscation is the production of noise modeled on an existing signal in order to make a collection of data more ambiguous, confusing, harder to exploit, more difficult to act on, and therefore less valuable. Obfuscation assumes that the signal can be spotted in some way and adds a plethora of related, similar, and pertinent signals — a crowd which an individual can mix, mingle, and, if only for a short time, hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no simple solution to the problem of privacy, because privacy itself is a solution to societal challenges that are in constant flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is real utility in an obfuscation approach, whether that utility lies in bolstering an existing strong privacy system, in covering up some specific action, in making things marginally harder for an adversary, or even in the “mere gesture” of registering our discontent and refusal. After all, those who know about us have power over us. They can deny us employment, deprive us of credit, restrict our movements, refuse us shelter, membership, or education, manipulate our thinking, suppress our autonomy, and limit our access to the good life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no simple solution to the problem of privacy, because privacy itself is a solution to societal challenges that are in constant flux. Some are natural and beyond our control; others are technological and should be within our control but are shaped by a panoply of complex social and material forces with indeterminate effects. Privacy does not mean stopping the flow of data; it means channeling it wisely and justly to serve societal ends and values and the individuals who are its subjects, particularly the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. Innumerable customs, concepts, tools, laws, mechanisms, and protocols have evolved to achieve privacy, so conceived, and it is to that collection that we add obfuscation to sustain it — as an active conversation, a struggle, and a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
