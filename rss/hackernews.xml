<title>I bought 200 Raspberry Pi Model B’s and I’m going to fix them</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; for sneak peaks and updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch – they were listed as broken and I believe they are customer returns. They are all Model B’s with with either 256MB or 512MB of RAM and are in various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in repairing these is to diagnose the issues, I created some tooling to assist with this which I will cover now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pi Diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you go around diagnosing 200+ faulty Raspberry Pi’s? Regardless of how clever I get around this its not going to be a fast process but I needed a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be categorising the Pi’s into two categories those that boot and those that are or appear dead. The “Dead” Pi’s will be revisited at a later date but lets take a look at how I’ve gone about testing the ones that boot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a cheap 3.5″ TFT Pi display and a hacky bash script I have created a diagnostic tool that will test the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;USB Ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethernet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display Output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also gives me an opportunity to test the GPIO to an extent as the display uses the I2C, VCC and GND pins and also gives me a chance to assess the physical condition of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I am around half way through the diagnostics and 59 of the Pi’s boot and work with minor damage such as snapped SD card slots or physically damaged USB ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 of the Pi’s are fully working although their is no Ethernet – These will not be fixed as such although the Ethernet chip and port will be removed transforming the device into a Model A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further 4 devices are fully working although the HDMI port doesn’t work, all 4 of these look to have damaged traces on the PCB around the HDMI circuitry – I will not be fixing these although I can make them safe to run headless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further 40 Pi’s are dead although some of them are likely just broken power delivery circuits which should be easy fixes – I will revisit these in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the remaining devices that need to be diagnosed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I will diagnose the remaining devices and add a follow up post that will have a total count of Pi’s in the box and a count of the ones that I believe are repairable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repairing the Pi’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I haven’t finished diagnosing the Pi’s I couldn’t help but repair a few of the easier fixes, lets look at a few repairs I carried out this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bent GPIO pins&lt;/h3&gt;

Bent GPIO Pins on one of the damaged Pi’s’
&lt;p&gt;How the hell does this happen?! one of the Pi’s had the GPIO pins swashed flat. I could have replaced the header but as no pins were snapped I carefully straightened them a metal ruler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst they didn’t come out perfect it is once again a fully working device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Broken USB Ports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok broken is an understatement! This poor Pi has had the ports ripped right off it, fortunately there is plenty dead Pi’s that will not be fixable so rather than buying parts I salvaged the USB ports from a dead Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then carefully unsoldered the remains of the broken port:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added the salvaged port along with plenty of no-clean flux and soldered it on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it, another Pi saved from the scrap pile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know people are excited to see the board level repairs but I can assure that they are coming, there are just a lot of devices to go through and I want to get the easy fixes out of the way first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fixed several with broken USB ports and added them to the box of working Pi’s. I will be covering SD card slot repairs when my AliExpress parts arrive but for now this is all on the repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a final photo showing the so-far working devices:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What am I going to do with 200 Raspberry Pi’s?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to disappoint but I won’t be building a cluster or decorating my walls with them! In fact I don’t have a project planned for these instead they will be sold on starting at £4 for a “Model A” and up to £9 for a fully boxed un-repaired Model B. I’m not doing this to make a quick buck I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of suggestions to send the Pi’s to a developing Country for students to learn IT on and whilst I really like that idea the logistics of it and finding someone trustworthy enough to hand them out aren’t straight forward. Then there is the issue or 200 Pi’s requiring SD cards, Keyboards, Mice and Displays A board alone just isn’t enough here and its just not simple or easy for me to do. Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will post an update tomorrow with the results of the diagnostics and a link where you can purchase the repaired devices – UK only though I’m afraid unless you are willing to cover the shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of this mammoth task in a comment below and please consider following this blog for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Introduction I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my twitter for sneak peaks and updates! I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch –… Continue reading I bought 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s and I’m going to fix them! Part 1</og:description>

<title>Firecracker: Start a VM in less than a second</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/01/23/firecracker--start-a-vm-in-less-than-a-second/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/01/23/firecracker--start-a-vm-in-less-than-a-second/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I spent this whole past week figuring out how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/&quot;&gt;Firecracker&lt;/a&gt; and I really like it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially when I read about Firecracker being released, I thought it was just a tool for cloud providers to use – I knew that AWS Fargate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io&quot;&gt;https://fly.io&lt;/a&gt; used it, but I didn’t think that it was something that I could directly use myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that Firecracker is relatively straightforward to use (or at least as straightforward as anything else that’s for running VMs), the documentation and examples are pretty clear, you definitely don’t need to be a cloud provider to use it, and as advertised, it starts VMs really fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to write about using Firecracker from a more DIY “I just want to run some VMs” perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start out by talking about what I’m using it for, and then I’ll explain a few things I learned about it along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-goal-a-game-where-every-player-gets-their-own-virtual-machine&quot;&gt;my goal: a game where every player gets their own virtual machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a sort of game to help people learn command line tools by giving them a problem to solve and a virtual machine to solve it in, a little like a CTF. It still basically exists only on my computer, but I’ve been working on it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot of one of the puzzles I’m working on right now. This one is about setting file extended attributes with &lt;code&gt;setfacl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/read-me.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/read-me.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-not-use-containers&quot;&gt;why not use containers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use virtual machines and not containers for this project basically because I wanted to mimic a real production machine that the user has root access to – I wanted folks to be able to set sysctls, use &lt;code&gt;nsenter&lt;/code&gt;, make &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; rules, configure networking with &lt;code&gt;ip&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt;, basically literally anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-starting-a-virtual-machine-is-slow&quot;&gt;the problem: starting a virtual machine is slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted people to be able to click “Start” on a puzzle and instantly launch a virtual machine. Originally I was launching a DigitalOcean VM every time, but they took about a minute to boot, I was getting really impatient waiting for them every time, and I didn’t think it was an acceptable user experience for people to have to wait a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried using qemu, but for reasons I don’t totally understand, starting a VM with qemu was also kind of slow – it seemed to take at least maybe 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;firecracker-can-start-a-vm-in-less-than-a-second&quot;&gt;Firecracker can start a VM in less than a second!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firecracker says this about performance in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes &amp;lt;= 125 ms to go from receiving the Firecracker InstanceStart API call to the start of the Linux guest user-space /sbin/init process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve been using Firecracker to start relatively large VMs – Ubuntu VMs running systemd as an init system – and it takes maybe 2-3 seconds for them to boot. I haven’t been measuring that closely because honestly 5 seconds is fast enough and I don’t mind too much about an extra 200ms either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough background, let’s talk about how to actually use Firecracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-s-a-hello-world-script-to-start-a-firecracker-vm&quot;&gt;here’s a “hello world” script to start a Firecracker VM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said at the beginning of this post that Firecracker is pretty straightforward to get started with. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firecracker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-the-firecracker-binary&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt; instructions are really good (they just work!) but it was separated into a bunch of steps and I wanted to see everything you have to do together in 1 shell script. So I wrote a short shell script you can use to start a Firecracker VM, and some quick instructions for how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a script like this was the first thing I did when trying to wrap my head around Firecracker. There’s basically 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Download Firecracker from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; and put it somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Run this script as root (you might have to edit the last line with the path to the &lt;code&gt;firecracker&lt;/code&gt; binary if it’s not in root’s PATH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also put this script in a gist: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jvns/c8470e75af67deec2e91ff1bd9883e53&quot;&gt;firecracker-hello-world.sh&lt;/a&gt;. The IP addresses here are chosen pretty arbitrarily. Most the script is just writing a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

  }
}
EOF
# start firecracker
firecracker --no-api --config-file vmconfig.json
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: You have a VM running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also SSH into the VM like this, with the SSH key that the script downloaded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e5978a8a91a5d4d3dccbd7d0d1cbd5cbd7d4&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt; -i hello-id_rsa
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice that if you run &lt;code&gt;ping 8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; inside this VM, it doesn’t work: it’s not able to connect to the outside internet. I think I’m actually going to use a setup like this for my puzzles where people don’t need to connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking commands and the rootfs image in this script are from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-demo/&quot;&gt;firecracker-demo&lt;/a&gt; repository which I found really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-put-a-firecracker-vm-on-the-docker-bridge&quot;&gt;how I put a Firecracker VM on the Docker bridge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a couple of problems with this “hello world” setup though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to be able to SSH to them from a Docker container (because I was running my game’s webserver in &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted them to be able to connect to the outside internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I struggled with trying to understand what a Linux bridge was and how it worked for about a day before figuring out how to get this to work. Here’s a slight modification of the previous script &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jvns/e13e6f498d26b584d8ab66651cdb04e0&quot;&gt;firecracker-hello-world-docker-bridge.sh&lt;/a&gt; which runs a Firecracker VM on the Docker bridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run it as root and SSH to the resulting VM like this (the IP is different because it has to be in the Docker subnet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2b5944445f6b1a1c19051a1c051b05191a&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt; -i hello-id_rsa
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically just changes 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s an extra &lt;code&gt;sudo brctl addif docker0 $TAP_DEV&lt;/code&gt; to add the VM’s network interface to the Docker bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It changes the gateway in the kernel boot args to the Docker bridge network interface’s IP (172.17.0.1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guess is that most people probably won’t want to use the Docker bridge, if you just want the VM to be able to connect to the outside internet I think the best way is to create a new bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my application I’m actually using a bridge called &lt;code&gt;firecracker0&lt;/code&gt; which is a docker-compose network I made. It feels a little sketchy to be using a bridge managed by Docker in this way but for now it works so I’ll keep doing that unless I find a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-built-my-own-firecracker-images&quot;&gt;how I built my own Firecracker images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “hello world” example is all very well and good, but you might say – ok, how do I build my own images?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you have to do 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a Linux kernel. I wanted a 5.8 kernel so I used the instructions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md&quot;&gt;firecracker docs on creating your own image&lt;/a&gt; for compiling a Linux kernel and they worked. I was kind of intimidated by this because I’d somehow never compiled a Linux kernel before, but I followed the instructions and it just worked the first time. I thought it would be super slow but it actually took less than 10 minutes to compile from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; filesystem image with all the files you want in your VM’s filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I put together my filesystem. Initially I tried downloading Ubuntu’s focal cloud image and extracting the root partition with &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;, but I couldn’t get it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I did what the Firecracker docs suggested and I built a Docker container and copied the contents of the container into a filesystem image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; I used looked like approximately: (I haven’t tested this exact Dockerfile but I think it should work). The main things are that you have to install some kind of init system because the default &lt;code&gt;ubuntu:20.04&lt;/code&gt; image doesn’t come with one because you don’t need one in a container. I also ran &lt;code&gt;unminimize&lt;/code&gt; to restore some man pages because the container is for interactive use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y init openssh-server
RUN yes | unminimize
# copy over some SSH keys and install other programs I wanted
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the basic shell script I’ve been using to create a filesystem image from the Docker container. I ran the whole thing as root, but technically you only have to run &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;IMG_ID=$(docker build -q .)
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -td $IMG_ID /bin/bash)

MOUNTDIR=mnt
FS=mycontainer.ext4

mkdir $MOUNTDIR
qemu-img create -f raw $FS 800M
mkfs.ext4 $FS
mount $FS $MOUNTDIR
docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/ $MOUNTDIR
umount $MOUNTDIR
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still not quite sure how much I’m going to like this approach of using Docker containers to create VM images – it feels a bit weird to me but it’s been working fine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most people who use Firecracker use a more lightweight init system than systemd and it’s definitely not necessary to use systemd but I think I’m going to stick with systemd for now because I want it to feel mostly like a normal production Linux system and a lot of the production servers I’ve used have used systemd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s all I have to say about creating images. Let’s talk a bit more about configuring Firecracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;firecracker-supports-either-a-socket-interface-or-a-configuration-file&quot;&gt;Firecracker supports either a socket interface or a configuration file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start a Firecracker VM 2 ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a configuration file and run &lt;code&gt;firecracker --no-api --config-file vmconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an API socket and write instructions to the API socket (like they explain in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-the-firecracker-binary&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt; instructions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really liked the configuration file approach for doing some initial experimentation because I found it easier to be able to see everything all in one place. But when integrating Firecracker with my actual application in real life, I found it easier to use the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-wrote-a-http-service-that-starts-firecracker-vms-use-the-go-sdk&quot;&gt;how I wrote a HTTP service that starts Firecracker VMs: use the Go SDK!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have a little HTTP service that I could call from my Ruby on Rails server to start new VMs and stop them when I was done with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the interface looks like – you give it a root image and a kernel and it returns an ID an the VM’s IP address. All of the files paths are just local paths on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ http post localhost:8080/create root_image_path=/images/base.ext4 kernel_path=/images/vmlinux-5.8
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;D248122A-1CCA-475C-856E-E3003A913F32&quot;,
    &quot;ip_address&quot;: &quot;172.102.0.4&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then here’s what deleting a VM looks like (I might make this use the &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; method later to make it more REST-y :) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ http post localhost:8080/delete id=D248122A-1CCA-475C-856E-E3003A913F32
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I wasn’t sure how I was going to use the Firecracker socket API to implement this interface, but then I discovered that there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-go-sdk&quot;&gt;Go SDK&lt;/a&gt;! This made it way easier to generate the correct JSON, because there were a bunch of structs and the compiler would tell me if I made a typo in a field name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically wrote all of my code so far by copying and modifying code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl/&quot;&gt;firectl&lt;/a&gt;, a Go command line tool. The reason I wrote my own tool insted of just using &lt;code&gt;firectl&lt;/code&gt; directly was that I wanted to have a HTTP API that could launch and stop lots of different VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;code&gt;firectl&lt;/code&gt; code and the Go SDK pretty easy to understand so I won’t say too much more about it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jvns/9b274f24cfa1db7abecd0d32483666a3&quot;&gt;a gist with my current HTTP service for managing Firecracker VMs&lt;/a&gt; which is a huge mess and pretty buggy and not intended for anyone but me to use. It does start VMs successfully though which is an important first step!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;digitalocean-supports-nested-virtualization&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean supports nested virtualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question I had was: “ok, where am I going to run these Firecracker VMs in production?“. The funny thing about running a VM in the cloud is that cloud instances are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; VMs. Running a VM inside a VM is called “nested virtualization” and not all cloud providers support it – for example AWS doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m using DigitalOcean and I was delighted to see that DigitalOcean does support nested virtualization even on their smallest droplets – I tried running the “hello world” Firecracker script from above and it just worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think GCP supports nested virtualization too but I haven’t tried it. The official Firecracker documentation suggests using a &lt;code&gt;metal&lt;/code&gt; instance on AWS, probably because Firecracker is made by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the performance implications of using nested virtualization are yet but I guess I’ll find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;firecracker-only-runs-on-linux&quot;&gt;Firecracker only runs on Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say that Firecracker uses KVM so it only runs on Linux. I don’t know if there’s a way to start VMs in a similarly fast way on a Mac, maybe there is? Or maybe there’s something special about KVM? I don’t understand how KVM works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-open-questions&quot;&gt;some open questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things I still haven’t figured out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right now I’m not using &lt;code&gt;jailer&lt;/code&gt;, another part of Firecracker that helps further isolate the Firecracker VM by adding some &lt;code&gt;seccomp-BPF&lt;/code&gt; rules and other things. Maybe I should be! &lt;code&gt;firectl&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;jailer&lt;/code&gt; so it would be pretty easy to copy the code that does that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still don’t totally understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Firecracker is fast (or alternatively, why qemu is slow). This &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/775736/&quot;&gt;LWN article&lt;/a&gt; says that it’s because Firecracker emulates less devices than qemu does, but I don’t know exactly which devices are the ones that are making qemu slow to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will it be slow to use nested virtualization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t know if it’s possible to run graphical applications in Firecracker, it seems like it might not because it’s intended for servers, but maybe it is possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure how many Firecracker VMs I can run at a time on my little $5/month DigitalOcean droplet, I need to do some of experiments.&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A DC woman said an FBI agent contacted her and said investigators were reaching out to the owner of every phone that touched a cell tower near the riot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;55.42863359443&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — If you were anywhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, you may be getting a knock on your door from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A D.C. woman said an agent visited her neighbor and called her, telling them investigators were tracking people whose cell phones connected to wi-fi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol during the riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don't call first, they just come to your house,&quot; Bree Stevens, a legal investigator who lives near Capitol Hill, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens said an FBI agent told her they were reaching out to every single person whose cell phone put them near the Capitol during the riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was out for a walk with a friend and his two young daughters on the afternoon of Jan. 6, but they were diverted by bomb scares until they ended up right next to the insurrection. Adults and kids were cordoned off and unable to get back to their apartments for four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don't want to be anywhere where they're going to go!&quot; she said on a video she shot while police officers in riot gear quick-stepped toward the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monday night, an investigator knocked on the door of her friend's apartment, who was &quot;in house clothes&quot; at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;His little girl had just painted his toenails, that was a little bit embarrassing,&quot; Stevens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens was out of town, so the agent called her on the phone number that the FBI had tracked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol,&quot; Stevens said. &quot;And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens said the agent told her she wasn't a suspect, but said he wanted pictures of things she might have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some civil rights advocates are concerned about the FBI's surveillance power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__section article__section_type_text utility__text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted, the FBI declined to discuss its investigative methods. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Releasing educational content for my open source work allowed me to grow my GitHub Sponsors from $40k to $100k/yr in just a few months. It's a win-win: the community gets help/education using my projects, and I get to work on them full-time, giving them the attention they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Please don&amp;#039;t say just hello in chat (2013)</title>
<link>https://nohello.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nohello.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Note that Keith could have got his answer minutes sooner, and needn't have kept Tim waiting. In fact, Tim could have started thinking about the question right away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's 2020 and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, &lt;strong&gt;you're actually just making the other person wait&lt;/strong&gt; for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;nonos&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Hello, are you around?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;hi sophie - quick question.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;You got a sec?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;yt?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;ping&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just ask the question!&lt;/strong&gt; 😫&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Java 1.0 Turns 25</title>
<link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/java-turns-25/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/java-turns-25/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On January 23rd, 1996, Sun Microsystems published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070310235103/http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/1996-01/sunflash.960123.10561.xml&quot;&gt;press release announcing the availability of Java 1.0&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto, CA - January 23, 1996 - JavaSoft, the newly-formed operating company of Sun Microsystems, Inc., today announced that the Java™ 1.0 programming environment is now available for download at http://java.sun.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Java's write-once-run-everywhere capability along with its easy accessibility have propelled the software and Internet communities to embrace it as the de facto standard for writing applications for complex networks,&quot; said Alan Baratz, JavaSoft's newly appointed president. &quot;We're delighted to invite developers to download Java 1.0 immediately and start building the next killer application.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Improving Java to create this strong 1.0 general release has been a great achievement for our team,&quot; said Ruth Hennigar, general manager of Java language and applications, JavaSoft. &quot;Since our first alpha release to the web in March we have received a lot of developer feedback and have improved functionality and reliability. This release incorporates the components that software developers have told us they need -- the Java Applet Viewer for running and testing applets; the Java Compiler; a prototype debugger and the Java Virtual Machine to run Java-based programs. We've also included class libraries for graphics, audio, animation and networking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/05/java-at-25/&quot;&gt;released alpha versions of Java through 1995&lt;/a&gt;, including having its technology available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator&quot;&gt;Netscape Navigator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)&quot;&gt;Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, but the release of the 1.0 version (followed by 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 shortly thereafter) marked the start of a journey which continues to this day. Oracle celebrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/connect/25-years-of-java-technology-community-family.html&quot;&gt;Java's 25th birthday of its alpha release&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial success and widespread availability of the up-and-coming internet helped bring Java to the masses, and the fact that the compiler and libraries were available for free was a big change from the availability of tools at that time. Open-source projects like gcc predated it by a decade, but most operating systems only had commercially available tools for building interactive graphical software. The fact that applets could be written, published to the internet, and then made available to run on a variety of different operating systems was unique at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial press release, Sun Microsystems said that Java 1.0 was available for Solaris, Windows 95 and Windows NT, and a release for macOS was promised by the end of the following year. When Apple and NeXT merged to create macOS, Java was a default install for the operating system, and the Objective-C runtime was bridged to Java to have JavaWebObjects, a Java-ised port of the Objective-C WebObjects stack. (The legacy of the Java WebObjects stack can still be seen today in some WebObjectApplications, or .woa extensions, on some of Apple's sites.) IBM promised to provide ports for OS/2 and Windows 3.1, and has been a Java licensee ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Java has evolved over the years, the core of the JVM has maintained stability – to the point where applications compiled with Java 1.0 can still be run on modern JVMs, albeit much faster. The bytecode format has (largely) remained unchanged; instead, the evolution has introduced few bytecodes (e.g. invokedynamic) and additional attribute types (module-info) as time has progressed. Some, like generics, were introduced in a backwards compatible fashion in Java 1.2 requiring no changes, so that they could continue to run on older JVMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, JVMs were often used as a vector for security vulnerabilities and frequent updates to the JVMs in browsers were required to stay safe. As the popularity of other in-browser plugin types (like Flash, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/farewell-flash/&quot;&gt;which we said goodbye to earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;), Java was relegated from the browser to the server, where it grew in popularity with the J2EE platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/11/jakarta-one-conference-2020/&quot;&gt;now JakartaEE&lt;/a&gt;). In-browser technologies continue to be a vector for malware, except this time the JIT that is being targeted is the one executing JavaScript, whose name owes its existence to Java's early release into browsers but is otherwise unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/&quot;&gt;rarely been out of the top of the programming tables&lt;/a&gt; over the intervening period, trading places with C for the top two spots, and with Android's release using the Java source code (if not the name) for powering its Dalvik VM applications, looks set to stay with us for another decade. The continuation of C-like syntax and its adamant following of semi-colon-at-the-end-of-the-line may look dated, but at the time gave C developers an easy transition into the language. Unlike C programs compiled in 1996, Java applications still run -- and significantly faster, thanks to the evolution of 32-bit and then 64-bit JVMs and advanced garbage collectors like Shenandoah and ZGC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java's success in the embedded space -- which after all, was originally designed as a set-top-box programming language -- isn't nearly so visible. Although Java is present on Blu-Ray and the JavaCard specification in SIMs and PIN chips, it perhaps didn't set a revolution off in the IoT world. However, embedded Java is lucrative and one of the reasons for the Oracle purchase of Sun Microsystems, who continues to steward the language and the runtime in an open environment to this day, including the release of OpenJDK which brought GPL to the codebase (although Java was freely available, it wasn't open-source until after the acquisition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Java's lasting legacy is not just bringing object-orientation to internet-enabled browsers, but the JVM itself. As both Java (and for that matter, JavaScript) have shown, if you have a language where the runtime is processor agnostic (JVM bytecode, JavaScript source code, WASM) then an execution or translation engine can then execute that code regardless of platform. This, more than anything else, has allowed the hardware to evolve – from 32-bit to 64-bit, from PowerPC to ARM to RISC-V – and still not require any compiled code changes from the original author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JVM is no longer used by Java alone, but by other languages built on top of it such as Java-inspired derivatives like Kotlin and Scala, to non-Java languages like JRuby and Jython. Oracle's Truffle and GraalVM projects show how you can build a JVM on top of Java and optimise languages that wouldn't otherwise be able to take advantage of those run-time optimisations. And as Java the language evolves, introducing lightweight threads and records, those changes will move the JVM forward to support more exotic runtimes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java and the JVM may be approaching middle-age, but they've got decades of use and improvements still to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the first version of Java that you used? Let us know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Java 1.0 Turns 25</og:title>
<og:description>On January 23rd, 1996, Sun Microsystems announced the availability of Java 1.0, an object oriented, platform neutral programming language. The fact that it was released as a freely available language and compiler for multiple platforms, coupled with its embedding in popular web browsers of the time, spring boarded Java to the world. InfoQ looks back at Java's history and future.</og:description>

<title>Facebook Disabled My Account After I Criticized Them</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/censored-by-facebook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Disabled My Account After I Criticized Them&quot; title=&quot;Facebook Disabled My Account After I Criticized Them&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook unfriended me. Why? So far as I can tell, it’s because I’ve been using Facebook to advocate for decentralization of social media. And apparently the algorithm didn’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, sometime between 8:54am and 9:06am Mountain, Facebook disabled my account. Just after 8:54am, I copy-pasted the content of my latest Twitter post into a new post on Facebook. At 9:06am, a friend received a Facebook notification indicating that he needed to update his trusted contacts because I was no longer available. Here’s the exact text and link that I posted to both Twitter and Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.6824817518248&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity&quot;&gt;https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121&quot;&gt;22 January 2021&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my friend’s notification came to my attention, I attempted to access Facebook. I was able to login. But I wasn’t able to see anything except the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your Account Has Been Disabled. For more information please visit the Help Center. Your account was disabled on Jan 22, 2021. If you think your account was disabled by mistake you can submit more information via the Help Center for up to 30 days after your account was disabled. After that, your account will be permanently disabled and you will no longer be able to request a review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-11.04.16-am.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on a link at the end of the message. It took me to the Help Center. There I found a link to request a review. Clicking on that link took me to a form which requested my full name and photo ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filled out the form, providing my name and a JPG of my government issued ID. Then I submitted the form. In response, I received the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We Cannot Review the Decision to Disable Your Account. Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-facebook-disabled-my-account&quot;&gt;Why Facebook Disabled My Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know for sure why Facebook disabled my account. I didn’t receive an explanation. There was no reference to particular Facebook Community Standards that I might have broken. There was no indication of how I might have been violating Facebook’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I have never received a warning from Facebook. And I didn’t receive a warning today. They provided no information beyond what I’ve quoted above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never used Facebook or any other social media to advocate violence, political or otherwise. And I’m a political centrist. In fact, during the political controversies of 2020, I repeatedly insisted on civility to such an extent that it frustrated some of my more partisan friends. So we can’t plausibly look for an explanation there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could imagine a conspiracy among people who dislike my religious views. There’s plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2018/09/this-post-is-brought-to-you-by.html&quot;&gt;strong anti-Mormon and anti-Transhumanist sentiment&lt;/a&gt; out there. Perhaps, banding together, a group of people reported or otherwise flagged my content on Facebook as inappropriate. But this seems a bit paranoid to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the cause was the link that I shared, in itself. Quite a few other people have shared that link on Facebook. In fact, at this moment, their API indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fdecentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity&quot;&gt;the link has received at least 88 likes, shares, and comments across Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. And that number has been increasing throughout the day without Facebook banning others for it, to the best of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the cause must have been the comment itself. Or, more generally, it may have been an emerging pattern in the comments of my posts. For a long time, I have advocated replacing Facebook with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2015/05/the-reputation-web.html&quot;&gt;decentralized social networks&lt;/a&gt;. And current events have motivated me to increase the frequency of that advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times over the last week or two, I have promoted decentralization in posts to both Facebook and Twitter. The content and links of the original posts were identical on the two platforms. So you can see them on my Twitter account. For easy reference, here are copies of my most recent cross-posts in reverse chronological order (as ordered on Twitter and previously on Facebook):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The debate between capitalism and socialism is often framed as a choice between large corporations and large government. This framing is cultivated by political and economic elites. The truth is that there’s an alternative to both. Limit both.

&lt;p&gt;“Decentralization is a practical necessity. For Christians, it’s also a theological mandate.

&lt;p&gt;“Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That may or may not be comparatively fair.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, on 13 January 2021, I shared to Facebook some thoughts in support of a tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. I can no longer quote the text from my Facebook post because it wasn’t a cross-post like the others. But it essentially affirmed Jack Dorsey’s interest in supporting decentralized social media, as he expressed in a recent tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@bluesky&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/51or6OuNNv&quot;&gt;https://t.co/51or6OuNNv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, almost all of my recent social media posts have been related to decentralization. Even the ones that aren’t obviously related to decentralization are still implicitly or indirectly related to decentralization. For example, decentralization is an important aspect of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://new-god-argument.com/compassion-argument.html&quot;&gt;Compassion Argument of the New God Argument&lt;/a&gt;. And a theology that would include &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2019/04/how-to-raise-dead.html&quot;&gt;human action toward resurrection&lt;/a&gt; as an expression of God’s work is a decentralized theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A machine learning algorithm would be capable of identifying accounts that publish posts with a pattern of negative sentiment toward centralized social media. The algorithm could also assign a score to the degree of negative sentiment. And Facebook could use that score to trigger automatic deactivation of accounts that surpass a relatively high score. None of this would require direct human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I don’t know for sure why Facebook deactivated my account. But based on what I know, I think the best explanation is that Facebook now implicitly hates decentralization. I suspect that one of its algorithms is checking for accounts that encourage use of alternative social networks. And it caught my account in its automated net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, perhaps some Facebook managers and engineers originally intended the algorithm to catch accounts that encourage use of social networks that focus on controversial politics. That seems possible. I’ve neither advocated for nor participated in those social networks. But I can see how my posts might have some syntactical commonalities with posts that advocate for those social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-facebook-doesnt-ban-everyone&quot;&gt;Why Facebook Doesn’t Ban Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren’t other people advocating for decentralized social networks without being banned? Maybe so. But the algorithm may have identified my account as a particularly useful target. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social network theory categorizes people according to how they function in networks. Some people are influencers within groups of similar persons. Some people are followers within groups. And some people are connectors between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectors facilitate transmission of ideas between dissimilar groups. Transmission of ideas can be good, promoting adaptability over time and creation of new value. But transmission of ideas can also be bad insofar as they undermine the coherence and survival of the group or system. All groups and systems, even the most creative, require a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, my social connections are unusually diverse. For example, I have many politically progressive and many politically conservative connections. I have many religious, secular, and atheist connections. And these connections include many influencers in a wide variety of geographies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a connector. I integrate ideas from one group into another. And while everyone may do that to some extent. I do it far more than most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind these two factors. First, I’ve been increasingly engaged in advocating decentralization, which would entail the end of Facebook as we know it. And second, I’m a relatively effective connector. Together, these factors make me an excellent target for a Facebook self-preservation algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want to minimize growth of interest in decentralization. And say you want to do that while also deactivating the fewest accounts possible, so as to raise the least overall concern possible. No matter how you go about doing this, you’ll raise some concern. But you can probably achieve an optimal balance by targeting people like Lincoln Cannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m right, Facebook disables other accounts like mine. We should expect them to target other people who function as connectors and promote decentralization. And I think we may indeed be seeing that. Here’s an example, also from today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;5.9347826086957&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ii was just bounced by Facebook. Haven't a clue why. Nothing particularly provocative of late other than campaigning for free speech on the nets in a clear dispassionate way. What is WRONG with those people! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/djOwVkfRtp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/djOwVkfRtp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Jim Rutt (@jim_rutt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jim_rutt/status/1352654498876055556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;harm-from-facebook&quot;&gt;Harm from Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complex situation for me. On the one hand, I favor the eventual dissolution (or at least decentralized transformation) of Facebook. On the other hand, like many people, I received value from using it. And I had intentionally chosen to continue using it for that value despite my concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve lost practical access to 15 years worth of live personal data. It represented extensive interactions with friends, family, and other acquaintances. I have backups. But those aren’t practical or complete, and can’t take the place of live data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also lost direct access to numerous business and non-profit functions. They include Facebook pages, groups, advertising accounts, application configurations, and more. They belong to my own businesses, businesses for which I work as a consultant, and non-profits to which I provide volunteer service. Fortunately, there are other people who can still access all of these things on my behalf, although that still poses significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that most people in my situation wouldn’t have backups of their personal Facebook data. And many probably wouldn’t have alternative admins in place to access business and non-profit functions. Their situations could be emotionally or financially devastating. For me, it’s not devastating, but it’s still far from fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these personal harms, there are of course the bigger and far more important collective harms. I won’t detail them here. They are the subject of other articles that you can find. And I’m just one of many who have been raising awareness of these harms for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Facebook users, many of us have become addicted to a social drug. The drug provides a pleasant high and some nice short term benefits. But the particular formulation presents serious adverse effects in the long term. And withdrawals are generally painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-decentralization&quot;&gt;Support Decentralization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do about this? We can support decentralization. That might sound hard. But there are things that each of us can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join alternative social networks. In doing so, we should prefer decentralized social networks. If we just go to other centralized social networks, we’re only punting the problem. Eventually, we need to eliminate centralized control of our online relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribute to decentralized technologies. If you have coding skills, there are people who want to hire you and open source projects to which you can contribute. If you’re not an engineer, you can invest in a decentralized future as easily as buying some Bitcoin or Ethereum. Start at Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivate decentralization of government. Vote for politicians and laws that strengthen local governance without isolationism. I believe such communities, leveraging new technologies, can still achieve economies of scale while becoming less fragile. Governance hasn’t stopped evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-next-steps&quot;&gt;My Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends have asked how they can help me personally. Probably the best thing that you can do is tell our mutual friends about the situation. Let them know what happened. Remind them that they can still connect with me here on my personal website, at other social networks, or via my email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like, you might also contact Facebook and submit an appeal on my behalf. They don’t have a customer service phone number that I know of. But there are tools in the “Help” section to report concerns when a friend’s account is not available. If they reactivate my account, I’ll continue to use it while working to replace it with practical decentralized alternatives over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without my account reactivated, I’ll probably just give up on Facebook for personal use. Some people in my situation have created a new account. But that feels heavy at this point, particularly given my other concerns with the platform. Without the value of access to live data that I’ve created with others over the years, Facebook probably no longer has enough to offer me on a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;
