<title>Single-dose propranolol tied to ‘selective erasure’ of anxiety disorders</title>
<link>https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/191908/anxiety-disorders/single-dose-propranolol-tied-selective-erasure-anxiety</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/191908/anxiety-disorders/single-dose-propranolol-tied-selective-erasure-anxiety</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;BARCELONA&lt;/span&gt; – A single 40-mg dose of oral propranolol, judiciously timed, constitutes an outside-the-box yet highly promising treatment for anxiety disorders, and perhaps for posttraumatic stress disorder as well, Marieke Soeter, PhD, said at the annual congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept here is that the beta-blocker, when given with a brief therapist-led reactivation of a fear memory, blocks beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain so as to interfere with the specific proteins required for reconsolidation of that memory, thereby disrupting the reconsolidation process and neutralizing subsequent expression of that memory in its toxic form. In effect, timely administration of one dose of propranolol, a drug that readily crosses the blood/brain barrier, achieves pharmacologically induced amnesia regarding the learned fear, explained &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marieke_Soeter&quot;&gt;Dr. Soeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a clinical psychologist at TNO, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, an independent nonprofit translational research organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like permanent fear erasure. You can never say that something is erased, but we have not been able to get it back,” she said. “Propranolol achieves selective erasure: It targets the emotional component, but knowledge is intact. They know what happened, but they aren’t scared anymore. The fear association is affected, but not the innate fear response to a threat stimulus, so it doesn’t alter reactions to potentially dangerous situations, which is important. If there is a bomb, they still know to run away from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single-session therapy addressing what psychologists call fear memory reconsolidation is totally outside the box relative to contemporary psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, which typically entails gradual fear extinction learning requiring multiple treatment sessions. But contemporary psychotherapy for anxiety disorders leaves much room for improvement, given that up to 60% of patients experience relapse. That’s probably because the original fear memory remains intact and resurfaces at some point despite initial treatment success, according to Dr. Soeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2 decades ago, other investigators showed in animal studies that fear memories are not necessarily permanent. Rather, they are modifiable, and even erasable, during the vulnerable period that occurs when the memories are reactivated and become labile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Dr. Soeter – then at the University of Amsterdam – and her colleagues demonstrated the same phenomenon using Pavlovian fear-conditioning techniques involving pictures and electric shocks in healthy human volunteers. They showed that a dose of propranolol given before memory reactivation blocked the fear response, while nadolol, a beta-blocker that does not cross the blood/brain barrier, did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since the fear memories they could ethically induce in the psychology laboratory are far less intense than those experienced by patients with anxiety disorders, the researchers next conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 45 individuals with arachnophobia. Fifteen received 40 mg of propranolol after spending 2 minutes in proximity to a large tarantula, 15 got placebo, and another 15 received propranolol without exposure to a tarantula. One week later, all patients who received propranolol with spider exposure were able to approach and actually pet the tarantula. Pharmacologic disruption of reconsolidation and storage of their fear memory had turned avoidance behavior into approach behavior. This benefit was maintained for at least a year after the brief treatment session (&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25980916&quot;&gt;Biol Psychiatry. 2015 Dec 15;78[12]:880-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, there was no direct effect of propranolol on spider beliefs. Therefore, do we need treatment that targets the cognitive level? These findings challenge one of the fundamental tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy that emphasizes changes in cognition as central to behavioral modification,” Dr. Soeter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, she and a coinvestigator have been working to pin down the precise conditions under which memory reconsolidation can be targeted to extinguish fear memories. They have shown in a 30-subject study that the process is both time- and sleep-dependent. The propranolol must be given within roughly an hour before to 1 hour after therapeutic reactivation of the fear memory to be effective. And sleep is an absolute necessity: When subjects were rechallenged 12 hours after memory reactivation and administration of propranolol earlier on the same day, with no opportunity for sleep, there was no therapeutic effect: The disturbing fear memory was elicited. However, when subjects were rechallenged 12 hours after taking propranolol the previous day – that is, after a night’s sleep – the fear memory was gone (Nat Commun. 2018 Apr 3;9[1]:1316. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03659-1&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-03659-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Postretrieval amnesia requires sleep to happen. &lt;span class=&quot;tag metaDescription&quot;&gt;Sleep may be the final and necessary link to prevent the process of reconsolidation&lt;/span&gt;,” Dr. Soeter said. It’s still unclear, however, how much sleep is required. Perhaps a nap will turn out to be sufficient, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues at the University of Amsterdam are now using single-dose propranolol-based therapy in patients with a wide range of phobias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The effects are pretty amazing,” Dr. Soeter said. “Everything is treatable. It’s almost too good to be true, but these are our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon her favorable anecdotal experience in treating a Dutch military veteran with severe combat-related PTSD of 10 years’ duration which had proved resistant to multiple conventional and unconventional interventions, a pilot study of single-dose propranolol with traumatic memory reactivation is now being planned in patients with war-related PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After one pill and a 20-minute session, this veteran with severe chronic PTSD has no more nightmares, insomnia, or alcohol problems, and he now travels the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her research met with an enthusiastic reception from other speakers at the ECNP session on PTSD. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Vermetten&quot;&gt;Eric Vermetten, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, welcomed the concept that pharmacologic therapy upon reexposure to fearful cues can impede the molecular and cellular cascade required to reestablish fearful memories. This also is the basis for the extremely encouraging, albeit preliminary, clinical data on ketamine, an &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/N-methyl-D-aspartic_acid&quot;&gt;N-methyl-D-aspartate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; receptor antagonist, as well as &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/34-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-mdma/&quot;&gt;3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MDMA) for therapeutic manipulation of trauma memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Targeting reconsolidation of existing fear memories is worthy of looking into further,” declared Dr. Vermetten, professor of psychiatry at Leiden (the Netherlands) University and a military mental health researcher for the Dutch Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New thinking regarding pharmacotherapy for PTSD is sorely needed, he added. He endorsed a consensus statement by the &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(17)31362-8/abstract&quot;&gt;PTSD Psychopharmacology Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that decried what was termed a crisis in pharmacotherapy of PTSD (Biol Psychiatry. 2017 Oct 1;82[7]:e51-e59. &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454621&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.03.007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Epub 2017 Mar 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only have two [Food and Drug Administration]-approved medications for PTSD – sertraline and paroxetine – and they were approved back in 2001,” Dr. Vermetten noted. “Research has stalled, and there is a void in new drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soeter’s study of the time- and sleep-dependent nature of propranolol-induced amnesia was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, where she is employed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Web Developer&amp;#039;s Guide to DNS</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Between the zillions of JavaScript bundles, cat videos, and banner ads that are the web, it’s easy to forget that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;–in fact, several &lt;em&gt;somethings&lt;/em&gt;–have to glue it all together. One of those somethings is the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/a&gt;, DNS, which bears the inglorious responsibility of turning a hostnames like &lt;code&gt;pets.com&lt;/code&gt; into a machine-friendly IP address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like through &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skip down to the &lt;code&gt;QUESTION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ANSWER&lt;/code&gt;: we wanted &lt;code&gt;pets.com&lt;/code&gt;, and we got back &lt;code&gt;72.52.10.14&lt;/code&gt;. That’s DNS in action, and most of the time we can and do take it for granted. Still, issues do arise. Most of our conscious interactions with DNS start with the word &lt;code&gt;NXDOMAIN&lt;/code&gt; or a too-generous TTL. When something goes wrong, having a cursory understanding of what’s happening under the hood can be helpful in diagnosing, fixing, and (better yet) preempting issues in the firmament of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is as good a place as any to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably already on good terms with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, which packages up webpage content in a way that browsers (“user agents”, in the vernacular) can understand. HTTP doesn’t specify how the browser connects to a server, but another protocol–the Transmission Control Protocol, TCP–sure does. Then there’s the Internet Protocol (IP), which specifies how both client and server should be addressed, and beneath that a link layer to sort out the actual hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For HTTP, the whole stack comes out something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Layer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Protocol&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Application&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HTTP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Format data request and response&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Transport&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TCP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deliver data between client and server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Internet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Address client and server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Link&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ethernet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Map request to physical network&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Layering of an HTTP request
&lt;p&gt;There you have it–the protocol stack where a web developer will spend 95% of her working life. TCP/IP is the gold standard in connection management, and except for those times when full-duplex communication is worth the trouble or low latency is more important than, say, reliable delivery–more on that in a moment–it’s where the web developer’s web begins and ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS can use a similar TCP/IP stack, but being parts of a simple system, most DNS operations can also travel the wire on the Internet’s favorite Roulette wheel: the User Datagram Protocol, UDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a good day, UDP is fast, simple, and stripped bare of unnecessary niceties like delivery guarantees and congestion management. But a UDP message may also never be delivered, or it may be delivered twice. It may never get a response, which makes for fun client design–particularly coming from the relatively safe and well-adjusted world of HTTP. With TCP, you get an established connection and all kinds of accommodations when Things Inevitably Go Wrong. UDP? “Best effort” delivery. Which means a packet thrown over the fence with a prayer for a soft landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get down to DNS. The usual story plays out something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You type &lt;code&gt;&quot;pets.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;lynx&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever Chrome alternative the kids are using these days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lynx&lt;/code&gt; asks a DNS “resolver” to identify the server containing &lt;code&gt;&quot;pets.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resolver doesn’t know firsthand, but it can forward your request to a friendly neighborhood DNS nameserver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the nameserver doesn’t know either, it can at least supply the address of another nameserver that might.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When that nameserver doesn’t know, it may throw in the towel and ask one of the web’s root servers to kindly please direct it to the name server responsible for the portion of the domain space beneath &lt;code&gt;&quot;.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&quot;.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt; nameserver can identify an authoritative name server responsible for &lt;code&gt;&quot;pets.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which can in turn provide an IP address for &lt;code&gt;&quot;pets.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any upstream resolvers may cache the result for future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same process can also turn a host address back into the corresponding domain. This involves a cute little trick with a special domain (&lt;code&gt;in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt;) and a timely inversion. Here’s a clue: &lt;code&gt;4.4.8.8.in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt; is the hostname of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public DNS server&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;code&gt;8.8.4.4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the IP reversed, the DNS zone just under &lt;code&gt;in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt; maps to an entire network (&lt;code&gt;8.in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt;) immediately beneath the top-level domain space and corresponding to the &lt;code&gt;8.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt; block of IPv4 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more interesting feature of DNS is its assumption that at any given hop a domain will just as often &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be known. This is where UDP suddenly seems like a better fit, both mechanically–datagrams being relatively lightweight travelers through an overworked network stack–but philosophically, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t resolve a host? Well, your request probably never arrived, either. Better luck next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say the datagram &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; arrive, however, and it’s time to serve a request. When a query reaches an adequately capable nameserver, that server will understand its place in the great domain hierarchy through a “zone” that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$TTL &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;86400&lt;/span&gt;  ;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;d
$ORIGIN pets.com.
@             IN      SOA   ns1.pets.com. ns2.pets.com. (
                        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;2019040700&lt;/span&gt; ; se = serial number
                        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;43200&lt;/span&gt;      ; ref = refresh (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;h)
                        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;        ; ret = update retry (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;m)
                        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1209600&lt;/span&gt;    ; ex = expiry (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;w)
                        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt;       ; nx = nxdomain ttl (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;h)

www           IN      CNAME   @
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve adjusted &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or TXT records in your domain registrar’s web interface, what you were actually editing were the resource records (“RR”s) in the underlying zone. When you hit “save”, the serial number (&lt;code&gt;se&lt;/code&gt;) incremented to reflect the change. As clients everywhere evicted their last-retrieved cached copy of the &lt;code&gt;pets.com&lt;/code&gt; zone, your new change (with its new serial) bubbled out across the internet, and some indeterminate time later it finished going “live”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll gloss over most of the details (see: diminishing returns), but this caching business is important. &lt;em&gt;Every record&lt;/em&gt; in DNS land contains a TTL (“time to live”) indicating how long it may be cached by a client before it needs to be refreshed from a trustworthy server again. Where the TTL isn’t explicitly set, the default &lt;code&gt;$TTL&lt;/code&gt; is used instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caching thing is such serious business that even &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dnsknowledge.com/whatis/nxdomain-non-existent-domain-2/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NXDOMAIN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (“NX” as in, “non-existent”, as in, “try again later”) errors within the zone &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a lifetime. The general goal is to avoid repeating DNS request for as long as reasonably possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our little tour has ventured forth from client to server and back, we haven’t &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; authorized a request. Assuming you know what to ask for, DNS is open to whoever comes a-knocking. This makes sense–it’s the Internet, after all–but it also has an interesting implication. Intentionally or otherwise, DNS has wound up with all the trappings of a lumbering, indispensable, distributed database. While we can use DNS to address friends and neighbors, we can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; use it to establish trust (see &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;DKIM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895?hl=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;ownership&lt;/a&gt;, and the location of other &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/dnslink/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;interesting systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In web development, it’s easy to leave DNS as something to muddle through when absolutely needed. But just a bit of time invested in studying it and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; learning it shines some light on a fundamental, enduring part of the Internet’s plumbing. It’s worth a peek! And I’d love to know what you find.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>JSON as configuration files: please don’t (2016)</title>
<link>https://arp242.net/weblog/json_as_configuration_files-_please_dont</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arp242.net/weblog/json_as_configuration_files-_please_dont</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;hatnote&quot;&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arp242.net/weblog/yaml_probably_not_so_great_after_all.html&quot;&gt;YAML: probably not so great after all.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently witnessed the rather disturbing trend of using JSON for configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don’t. Ever. Not even once. It’s a really bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just not what JSON was designed to do, and consequently not what it’s good at. JSON is intended to be a “lightweight data-interchange format”, and claims that it is “easy for humans to read and write” and “easy for machines to parse and generate”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data interchange format JSON is pretty okay. A human &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; read and write it comparatively easily, and it’s also pretty easy to parse for machines (although there &lt;a href=&quot;http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php&quot;&gt;are problems&lt;/a&gt;). It’s a good trade-off between machine-readable and human-readable and a huge improvement on what it intended to replace: XML, which I consider to be unreadable by &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; machines and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using it for other purposes is somewhat akin to saying “hey, this hammer works really well for driving in nails! I love it! Why not hammer in this screw with it!” Sure, it sort of works, but it’s very much the wrong tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;specific-shortcomings&quot;&gt;Specific shortcomings &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the biggest problem: you can’t add comments in JSON files. The occasional JSON parser supports it, but most don’t and it’s not in the standard, in fact, comment support was &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+DouglasCrockfordEsq/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr&quot;&gt;explicitly removed from JSON&lt;/a&gt; for good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way to document on why settings were set to what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way to add mnemonics or describe caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way to keep a basic ChangeLog in the config file itself, documenting which changes were made (which can be immensely useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more difficult to debug, as quickly commenting out a section isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/244858/660921&quot;&gt;suggested workaround&lt;/a&gt; is to use a new key, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{
        &quot;__comment&quot;: &quot;Something to comment about&quot;,
        &quot;actual_data&quot;: &quot;Hello, world&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just damn ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people have pointed out that you can use the commit log, but this is an even worse idea. Consider something like &lt;code&gt;bower&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Please be VERY CAREFUL when updating this, since this library often
// makes incompatible changes even in minor bugfix releases (e.g. when
// updating from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2).
'some_stupid_lib': '1.1.1'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are you going to dig though the entire commit history in search for some important message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;readability&quot;&gt;Readability &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; readable. Sure, it’s readable &lt;em&gt;for a data-interchange format&lt;/em&gt;, but not readable for a configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readability counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strictness&quot;&gt;Strictness &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JSON standard is fairly strict − this is good, it allows for concise and fast parsers that don’t have to muck about with different formats − but it also means it’s more difficult to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a trailing comma in objects or arrays is an error, and something that has bitten me more than once. And having to escape all instances or &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; can be pretty annoying if your string contains a lot of &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-programmability&quot;&gt;Lack of programmability &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always an issue, but sometimes it is, especially when JSON is used to configure some piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# This works much better on BritOS
if ($uname === 'BritOS')
        $wear = 'trousers';
else
        $wear = 'pants';
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue for example in MediaWiki’s &lt;code&gt;skin.json&lt;/code&gt; file. What I wanted to do is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; include some CSS if a certain plugin is loaded, and we can’t do this − we can (probably) work around it in the PHP file, but “working around” things is never good (and remember, we can’t leave a comment in the JSON file to inform people that we’re working around things!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old way of doing things in MediaWiki (declaring class variables) was a lot better and provided much more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name and shame :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer class=&quot;postscript&quot; readability=&quot;17.98&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mail me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:martin@arp242.net&quot;&gt;martin@arp242.net&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/arp242.net/issues/new&quot;&gt;create a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; for feedback, questions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;cc1a&quot; id=&quot;cc1a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-dropCapImage&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*GzPIUbv3332KPJSLQ7GnBA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GzPIUbv3332KPJSLQ7GnBA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCapText&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ost of us understand by now that we’re being followed across the web. But how much do we know about how the smartphone apps we use track our every move? Thanks to tiny pieces of code that millions of developers use to make their lives easier, an array of companies gets free access to data they can employ to understand your habits. The process is invisible, and it’s worse news for you than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a1da&quot; id=&quot;a1da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When we browse the web through Google Chrome, for example, a dizzying array of companies follow us. Such is the Wild West of our modern web, but you still remain in control of which sites you visit and which social networks you log into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;419b&quot; id=&quot;419b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The shift to native apps changes this equation, however. Suddenly you’re no longer in full control of what’s loaded, nor of who is tracking you, and you must trust app developers to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;2ae0&quot; id=&quot;2ae0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this should make you skeptical of marketing like Apple’s recent “privacy matters” campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;442e&quot; id=&quot;442e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;On mobile, tracking is generally performed through the use of a “software development kit” or SDK—a set of tools that helps app developers get something done faster. Many SDKs help developers debug their code or hook into useful services, but others help advertisers and marketing companies peer into your private life. Take the iHeartRadio app for example: Last fall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/irl-ads-are-taking-scary-inspiration-from-social-media-7088e8241beb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/irl-ads-are-taking-scary-inspiration-from-social-media-7088e8241beb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it contained code from Cuebiq’s SDK, which would permit user data to be sold for the purposes of ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e752&quot; id=&quot;e752&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of this should make you skeptical of marketing like Apple’s recent “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy matters&lt;/a&gt;” campaign. While the company offers tools within Safari to block trackers on the web, it doesn’t offer any control over trackers embedded in apps that are distributed through the iOS App Store. Most people use the Google Chrome browser anyway, and it has even fewer privacy protections baked in. (Apple does &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/protecting_the_user_s_privacy&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/protecting_the_user_s_privacy&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ask developers&lt;/a&gt; to “respect user preferences for how data is used,” but good luck with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;05a6&quot; id=&quot;05a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;SDKs present a solution to Apple’s pesky tracking restriction for advertisers. They can connect who you are between apps, provided the developer of each app uses the same SDK and the advertiser is able to use signals to figure out who you are. If we look at the top 200 apps on the iOS App Store, it’s interesting to see how broad the reach of most SDKs actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca25&quot; id=&quot;ca25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The top 10 most commonly used SDK libraries in the top iOS apps, as reported by analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://mightysignal.com/top-ios-sdks&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mightysignal.com/top-ios-sdks&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mighty Signal&lt;/a&gt;, are largely provided by Facebook (three out of 10) and Google (four out of 10). &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s AdMob tools&lt;/a&gt;, for example, helps developers show advertising and track their users, and it’s integrated into 78% of the top apps on iOS—everything from the Holy Bible to LinkedIn. Facebook’s “Core Kit,” which provides access to the social platform’s features, is integrated into 61% of top apps. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7d2c&quot; id=&quot;7d2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Both of these SDKs allow Facebook and Google to track users beyond their desktop web browsers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/analytics/1626797377593441&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/analytics/1626797377593441&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;automatically collect information&lt;/a&gt; like when you installed the app, each time you opened it, and what you purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32d8&quot; id=&quot;32d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Tracking in SDKs is clearly part of the modern App Store ecosystem, and it goes far beyond the big corporate names. There are a dizzying array of companies you’ve never heard of invisibly tracking your habits in apps you use every day. Networks like Vungle, Apps Flyer, and Applovin all call themselves “advertising and analytics” platforms. They help developers monetize their apps, and all of them track data to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-1-more&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-1-more&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sell to&lt;/a&gt; other partners behind the scenes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc93&quot; id=&quot;cc93&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This often overflows into our daily lives in weird ways. The technology podcast &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Reply All&lt;/em&gt; recently dug into mysterious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/135-the-robocall-conundrum&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/135-the-robocall-conundrum&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;automated robocalls&lt;/a&gt;, which were somehow matching the area code of producer Damiano Marchetti, even adjusting to different locations as he traveled. How could such robocallers know where you physically are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;25f3&quot; id=&quot;25f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After digging into all of Damiano’s apps, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Reply All&lt;/em&gt; made a discovery: He had downloaded a game called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,&lt;/em&gt; which reported the phone’s location and IMEI (a unique identifier) to a bunch of analytics companies, which then sold that data, eventually leading to robocallers purchasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;06b6&quot; id=&quot;06b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of SDKs is intentionally obfuscated from view in the same way a magician wishes their most impressive tricks to remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b09&quot; id=&quot;0b09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;The &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt; about data collection on millions of other apps, such as those intended for menstrual cycle and body weight tracking. Those apps were found to sell this data to Facebook. Many people assume that Facebook is monitoring their microphones, but the reality is that they don’t need to: They can just collect data from the apps you’re using all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6169&quot; id=&quot;6169&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the past, Apple has moved to make it more difficult to identify you by blocking access to unique identifiers and your phone number, but it’s still trivial to correlate an identity via your IP address, the name of a Wi-Fi network, or just matching together the bread crumbs of data they grab about you. Android allows even broader access to identifiers—not surprising, given that it’s built by a company that relies on advertising to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86b9&quot; id=&quot;86b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The world of SDKs and the companies tracking with them is intentionally obfuscated from view in the same way a magician wishes their most impressive tricks to remain secret. If you knew that the game you love was the one ratting out your habits, you’d probably consider uninstalling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2de0&quot; id=&quot;2de0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s frustratingly little we can do to combat SDK tracking without intervention from Apple and Google. There are nuclear methods that can help protect you, such as installing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;network-wide ad-blocker&lt;/a&gt; on your home Wi-Fi, which blocks the requests at the source—but of course that only works within the confines of your home. On the go, some VPN providers are able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;block advertising&lt;/a&gt;, but with the same limitations: You must stay connected to the VPN at all times to block them, which simply isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59e7&quot; id=&quot;59e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What we really need is change from the top. Apple and Google should provide operating system controls that show the parties harvesting data inside the apps on our devices or should require third parties to reveal this information. A good example of this in practice can be found in the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; app, which allows users to disable tracking on a per-SDK basis in its settings. Requiring this should be standard for all developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1993&quot; id=&quot;1993&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the gatekeepers of mobile app stores have a responsibility to give us more control. Otherwise, the next big privacy scandal will be the digital equivalent of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: All our information out there, under the surface, helping companies build a picture of who we are—without us ever seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;When detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a murder investigation last December, they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Investigators also had other circumstantial evidence, including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic, the same model that Mr. Molina owned, though they could not see the license plate or attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But after he spent nearly a week in jail, the case against Mr. Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him. Last month, the police arrested another man: his mother’s ex-boyfriend, who had sometimes used Mr. Molina’s car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The warrants, which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault, turn the business of tracking cellphone users’ locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement. In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies, it is just the latest example of how personal information — where you go, who your friends are, what you read, eat and watch, and when you do it — is being used for purposes many people never expected. As privacy concerns have mounted among consumers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/technology/california-online-privacy-law.html&quot;&gt;policymakers&lt;/a&gt; and regulators, tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique, whose use has risen sharply in the past six months, according to Google employees familiar with the requests. It can help solve crimes. But it can also snare innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Technology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users’ information. The new warrants go further, suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues. Often, Google employees said, the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Law enforcement officials described the method as exciting, but cautioned that it was just one tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;refer-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Privacy Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times is launching an ongoing examination of privacy. We'll dig into the ideas, history and future of how our information navigates the digital ecosystem and what's at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;refer-pic&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/opinion/sunday/10bennet-privacy-promo/10bennet-privacy-largeHorizontalJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It doesn’t pop out the answer like a ticker tape, saying this guy’s guilty,” said Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington State who has worked on several cases involving these warrants. Potential suspects must still be fully investigated, he added. “We’re not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions, because many of the investigations are still open and judges frequently seal the warrants. The practice was first used by federal agents in 2016, according to Google employees, and first publicly reported last year in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wral.com/Raleigh-police-search-google-location-history/17377435/&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. It has since spread to local departments across the country, including in California, &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/764-fdlelocationsearch/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/02/07/google-location-police-search-warrants&quot;&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and Washington. This year, one Google employee said, the company received as many as 180 requests in one week. Google declined to confirm precise numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The technique illustrates a phenomenon privacy advocates have long referred to as the “if you build it, they will come” principle — anytime a technology company creates a system that could be used in surveillance, law enforcement inevitably comes knocking. Sensorvault, according to Google employees, includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The new orders, sometimes called “geofence” warrants, specify an area and a time period, and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there. It labels them with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the users’ names and other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;‘‘There are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked — and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case, that should give everybody serious pause,” said Catherine Turner, a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Investigators who spoke with The New York Times said they had not sent geofence warrants to companies other than Google, and Apple said it did not have the ability to perform those searches. Google would not provide details on Sensorvault, but Aaron Edens, an intelligence analyst with the sheriff’s office in San Mateo County, Calif., who has examined data from hundreds of phones, said most Android devices and some iPhones he had seen had this data available from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In a statement, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to “vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement.” He added that it handed over identifying information only “where legally required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Molina, 24, said he was shocked when the police told him they suspected him of murder, and he was surprised at their ability to arrest him based largely on data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I just kept thinking, You’re innocent, so you’re going to get out,” he said, but he added that he worried that it could take months or years to be exonerated. “I was scared,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Detectives have used the warrants for help with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/10/23/feds-are-ordering-google-to-hand-over-a-load-of-innocent-peoples-locations/#442ba7015a0d&quot;&gt;robberies&lt;/a&gt;, sexual assaults, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wral.com/Raleigh-police-search-google-location-history/17377435/&quot;&gt;arsons&lt;/a&gt; and murders. Last year, federal agents &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/757-austinaffidavit1/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;requested the data&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a string of bombings around Austin, Tex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;svelte-1xx66kd&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving a warrant, Google gathers location information from its database, Sensorvault, and sends it to investigators, with each device identified by an anonymous ID code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;svelte-1xx66kd&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can then get further location data on devices that appear relevant, allowing them to see device movement beyond the original area defined in the warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;svelte-1xx66kd&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After detectives narrow the field to a few devices they think may belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the name, email address and other data associated with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Austin investigators &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/758-austinaffidavit2/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;obtained another warrant&lt;/a&gt; after a fourth bomb exploded. But the suspect killed himself three days after that bomb, as they were closing in. Officials at the time said surveillance video and receipts for suspicious purchases helped identify him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the response from Google was helpful or timely, saying that any question about the technique “touches on areas we don’t discuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Officers who have used the warrants said they showed promise in finding suspects as well as witnesses who may have been near the crime without realizing it. The searches may also be valuable in cold cases. &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/764-fdlelocationsearch/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;A warrant last year&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, for example, sought information on a murder from 2016. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the data was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The approach has yielded useful information even if it wasn’t what broke the case open, investigators said. In a home invasion in Minnesota, for example, Google data showed a phone taking the path of the likely intruder, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/02/07/google-location-police-search-warrants&quot;&gt;a news report&lt;/a&gt; and police documents. But detectives also cited other leads, including a confidential informant, in developing suspects. &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/761-minnesotaindictment/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;Four people were charged&lt;/a&gt; in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;According to several current and former Google employees, the Sensorvault database was not designed for the needs of law enforcement, raising questions about its accuracy in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Though Google’s data cache is enormous, it doesn’t sweep up every phone, said Mr. Edens, the California intelligence analyst. And even if a location is recorded every few minutes, that may not coincide with a shooting or an assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Google often doesn’t provide information right away, investigators said. The Google unit handling the requests has struggled to keep up, so it can take weeks or months for a response. In the Arizona investigation, police received data six months after sending the warrant. In a different Minnesota case this fall, it came in four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But despite the drawbacks, detectives noted how precise the data was and how it was collected even when people weren’t making calls or using apps — both improvements over tracking that relies on cell towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It shows the whole pattern of life,” said Mark Bruley, the deputy police chief in Brooklyn Park, Minn., where investigators have been using the technique since this fall. “That’s the game changer for law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Location data is a lucrative business — and Google is by far the biggest player, propelled largely by its Android phones. It uses the data to power advertising tailored to a person’s location, part of a more than $20 billion market for location-based ads last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2009, the company introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/11/google-latitude-now-with-location.html&quot;&gt;Location History&lt;/a&gt;, a feature for users who wanted to see where they had been. Sensorvault stores information on anyone who has opted in, allowing regular collection of data from GPS signals, cellphone towers, nearby Wi-Fi devices and Bluetooth beacons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;People who turn on the feature can see a timeline of their activity and get recommendations based on it. Google apps prompt users to enable Location History for things like traffic alerts. Information in the database is held indefinitely, unless the user deletes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“We citizens are giving this stuff away,” said Mr. Ernsdorff, the Washington State prosecutor, adding that if companies were collecting data, law enforcement should be able to obtain a court order to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Current and former Google employees said they were surprised by the warrants. Brian McClendon, who led the development of Google Maps and related products until 2015, said he and other engineers had assumed the police would seek data only on specific people. The new technique, he said, “seems like a fishing expedition.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The practice raises novel legal issues, according to Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on criminal law in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;One concern: the privacy of innocent people scooped up in these searches. Several law enforcement officials said the information remained sealed in their jurisdictions but not in every state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In Minnesota, for example, the name of an innocent man was released to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonywebster.com/&quot;&gt;local journalist&lt;/a&gt; after it became part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/771-minnesota-case-redacted2/5b7ca86063c3a64d310c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;police record&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators had his information because he was within 170 feet of a burglary. Reached by a reporter, the man said he was surprised about the release of his data and thought he might have appeared because he was a cabdriver. “I drive everywhere,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;These searches also raise constitutional questions. The Fourth Amendment says a warrant must request a limited search and establish probable cause that evidence related to a crime will be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Warrants reviewed by The Times frequently established probable cause by explaining that most Americans owned cellphones and that Google held location data on many of these phones. The areas they targeted ranged from single buildings to multiple blocks, and most sought data over a few hours. In the Austin case, warrants covered several dozen houses around each bombing location, for times ranging from 12 hours to a week. It wasn’t clear whether Google responded to all the requests, and multiple officials said they had seen the company push back on broad searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/politics/supreme-court-warrants-cell-phone-privacy.html&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that a warrant was required for historical data about a person’s cellphone location over weeks, but the court has not ruled on anything like geofence searches, including a technique that pulls information on all phones registered to a cell tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Google’s legal staff decided even before the 2018 ruling that the company would require warrants for location inquiries, and it crafted the procedure that first reveals only anonymous data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Normally we think of the judiciary as being the overseer, but as the technology has gotten more complex, courts have had a harder and harder time playing that role,” said Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We’re depending on companies to be the intermediary between people and the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In several cases reviewed by The Times, a judge approved the entire procedure in a single warrant, relying on investigators’ assurances that they would seek data for only the most relevant devices. Google responds to those orders, but Mr. Kerr said it was unclear whether multistep warrants should pass legal muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some jurisdictions require investigators to return to a judge and obtain a second warrant before getting identifying information. With another warrant, investigators can obtain more extensive data, including months of location patterns and even emails.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Investigators in Arizona have never publicly disclosed a likely motive in the killing of Joseph Knight, the crime for which Mr. Molina was arrested. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/762-molina-form-4-redacted/d448fe5dbad9f5720cd3/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;a court document&lt;/a&gt;, they described Mr. Knight, a 29-year-old aircraft repair company employee, as having no known history of drug use or gang activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Detectives sent the geofence warrant to Google soon after the murder and received data from four devices months later. One device, a phone Google said was linked to Mr. Molina’s account, appeared to follow the path of the gunman’s car as seen on video. His carrier also said the phone was associated with a tower in roughly the same area, and his Google history showed a search about local shootings the day after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After his arrest, Mr. Molina told officers that Marcos Gaeta, his mother’s ex-boyfriend, had sometimes taken his car. The Times found a traffic ticket showing that Mr. Gaeta, 38, had driven that car without a license. Mr. Gaeta also had a lengthy criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;While Mr. Molina was in jail, a friend told his public defender, Jack Litwak, that she was with him at his home about the time of the shooting, and she and others &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/767-molinadefense/3aafce8edd1efdfc8977/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;provided texts&lt;/a&gt; and Uber receipts to bolster his case. His home, where he lives with his mother and three siblings, is about two miles from the murder scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Litwak said his investigation found that Mr. Molina had sometimes signed in to other people’s phones to check his Google account. That could lead someone to appear in two places at once, though it was not clear whether that happened in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Gaeta was arrested in California on an Arizona warrant. He was then charged in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/768-california-arrest/3aafce8edd1efdfc8977/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot;&gt;separate California homicide&lt;/a&gt; from 2016. Officials said that case would probably delay his extradition to Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A police spokesman said “new information came to light” after Mr. Molina’s arrest, but the department would not comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Months after his release, Mr. Molina was having trouble getting back on his feet. After being arrested at work, a Macy’s warehouse, he lost his job. His car was impounded for investigation and then repossessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The investigators “had good intentions” in using the technique, Mr. Litwak said. But, he added, “they’re hyping it up to be this new DNA type of forensic evidence, and it’s just not.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Aphex Twin Speaks to Tatsuya Takahashi (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;But I’ve also read studies from the old Philips laboratories in the Netherlands that show orchestras average deviation from 440 Hz was measured over many concerts and was seen to differ by a few Hz, usually slightly below. Pretty anal. Some people obviously really cared that 440 Hz was being adhered to in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why 440 Hz was chosen in the first place is another interesting story, but looking at the resonances of water and sound is a great place to start, or read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymatics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cymatics&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t already familiar with it, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; So many things are standardised that you don't really think about because they were there before you started using it. 440 Hz was brought about to standardise the way people play together and, yeah, someone can bring a guitar to a piano and it would work together because of that standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like how a green light means you can cross the road or if you shake your head sideways it means no. Those two standards will help you through life in many places around the world. But it's dangerous to enforce standards in creativity. I have a son who's started school in Japan, where every kid will paint the sun red. Now that is some fucked up standardisation! Just really messed up on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm not going into that whole 432 Hz vs 440 Hz debate. (BTW: I absolutely love cymatics and I've done some nice workshops for kids with it.) But I will say different frequencies sound different, so why not use that in your music? You got to use whatever feels right and the monologue let's you do exactly that with pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;RDJ:&lt;/span&gt; Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; Talking of standards, the sample rate of 48 kHz is another one for sampling and signal processing, but the volca sample uses a weird one at 31.25 kHz. Purely because of technical constraints, but I was thinking that might be part of the reason you liked it so much, because the different sample rate gives it a unique sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;RDJ:&lt;/span&gt; Haha, yes, it was pretty much the first thing I noticed. Yeah, I thought the 48 kHz, was based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nyquist Theorem&lt;/a&gt;. I think it’s double what humans can apparently hear or something, which is another weird one. I don’t know how anybody worked out humans only hear to 20 kHz. I mean even if you can’t hear above 20 kHz, it doesn't mean that your body doesn't feel it. You don’t just experience sound through your eardrums. A good example of this is listening to a recording of your own voice. To almost everyone apart from maybe the most narcissistic, it always sounds weird/thinner/smaller, as you don’t feel the vibration of your chest and body. There are other reasons of course but that’s one for sure. Anyway, I’m into the extremes of the audio spectrum, ultra clarity ’n’ all but I probably prefer fucked-muffled/lo-bit/’70s sound more, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; Oh, and when something defies the standard – I just remembered the first time I played a Yamaha SK-10, the faders were all upside down, like max was downwards, even on the volume. I didn't know what was going on and it threw me off at first, but it's actually a bit fun like that and you soon realise it all comes from organ drawbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;RDJ:&lt;/span&gt; I never played the SK-10, but these Calrec mixers I use are like that also, the faders are backwards. There is a little dip switch inside to change it, but I think they have them like that for TV/broadcasting, coz if someone falls asleep at the desk they don’t want them to push all the faders up and distort two million TVs at once… Not surprising they have this safeguard considering how skull numbingly boring most TV is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; Right!! Yeah, but there is a certain feeling to pulling rather than pushing. It's like how an orgasm is &quot;coming&quot; in English, but it's “going” [iku] in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;RDJ:&lt;/span&gt; Never thought of it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; I mean, written text in Japanese was traditionally vertical. Although now a lot is westernised and horizontal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;RDJ:&lt;/span&gt; Ah, that’s kinda sad… So traditional Japanese text is like trackers and now it’s going like Cubase! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;TT:&lt;/span&gt; I sometimes wonder what Japanese synths would have looked like if they didn't copy Moog in the ’70s. You've got to think about what is convention and what is really a good design.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>South Korea now recycles 95% of its food waste</title>
<link>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/south-korea-recycling-food-waste/</link>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;70.071286141575&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;31.9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/&quot;&gt;wastes&lt;/a&gt; more than 1.3 billion tonnes of food each year. The planet’s 1 billion hungry people could be fed on less than a quarter of the food wasted in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; &quot; src=&quot;https://assets.weforum.org/editor/rfSGH5Vfqq-FVWT_kuO75gs7vTew4nG8946_WQQLbA0.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: UN FAO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;32.85393258427&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Innovation_with_a_Purpose_VF-reduced.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the World Economic Forum identified cutting food waste by up to 20 million tonnes as one of 12 measures that could help transform global food systems by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now South Korea is taking a lead, recycling 95% of its food waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;35.082802547771&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t always this way in the country. The mouth-watering array of side dishes that accompany a traditional South Korean meal - called &lt;em&gt;banchan&lt;/em&gt; - are often left unfinished, contributing to one of the world’s highest rates of food wastage. South Koreans each &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koreaexpose.com/banchan-south-korea-food-waste/&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/a&gt; more than 130 kg of food waste each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34.826086956522&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, per capita food waste in Europe and North America is 95 to 115 kg a year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. But the South Korean government has taken radical action to ensure that the mountain of wasted food is recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as 2005, dumping food in landfill was banned, and in 2013 the government introduced compulsory food waste recycling using special biodegradable bags. An average four-person family pays $6 a month for the bags, a fee that helps encourage home composting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bag charges also meet 60% of the cost of running the scheme, which has increased the amount of food waste recycled from 2% in 1995 to 95% today. The government has approved the use of recycled food waste as fertilizer, although some becomes animal feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart bins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38.659793814433&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has played a leading part in the success of the scheme. In the country’s capital, Seoul, 6,000 automated &lt;a href=&quot;http://eng.me.go.kr/eng/web/index.do?menuId=387&quot;&gt;bins&lt;/a&gt; equipped with scales and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) weigh food waste as it is deposited and charge residents using an ID card. The pay-as-you-recycle machines have reduced food waste in the city by 47,000 tonnes in six years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/food-waste-south-korea-seoul_n_5ca48bf7e4b0ed0d780edc54?guccounter=1&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to city officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are urged to reduce the weight of the waste they deposit by removing moisture first. Not only does this cut the charges they pay - food waste is around 80% moisture - but it also saved the city $8.4 million in collection charges over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collected using the biodegradable bag scheme is squeezed at the processing plant to remove moisture, which is used to create biogas and bio oil. Dry waste is turned into fertiliser that is, in turn, helping to drive the country’s burgeoning urban farm movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban farms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34.702549575071&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of urban farms or community gardens in Seoul has increased sixfold in the past seven years. They now total 170 hectares - roughly the size of 240 football fields. Most are sandwiched between apartment blocks or on top of schools and municipal buildings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/10/281_256714.html&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; is even located in the basement of an apartment block. It is used to grow mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city government provides between 80% and 100% of the start-up costs. As well as providing food, proponents of the scheme say urban farms bring people together as a community in areas where residents are often isolated from one another. The city authorities are planning to install food waste composters to support urban farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Korean_cuisine-Banchan-11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Banchan dishes are often left unfinished, contributing to food waste &quot; src=&quot;https://assets.weforum.org/editor/WUMh1KP5G0wPjHLe1JmgPSAyRF5WwelO78Leig4bXGU.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to &lt;em&gt;banchan&lt;/em&gt;. In the long term, some people argue South Koreans will need to change their eating habits if they are really going to make a dent in their food waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This means there has to be a change in our dining habits, such as shifting to a one-plate culinary culture like other countries, or at least reducing the amount of banchan that we lay out.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Indictment of Julian Assange Is a Threat to Journalism</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-indictment-of-julian-assange-is-a-threat-to-journalism</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-indictment-of-julian-assange-is-a-threat-to-journalism</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that, in the summer of 2014, the Justice Department had indicted &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/julian-assange&quot;&gt;Julian Assange&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of WikiLeaks, charging that, in 2010, he engaged in a criminal conspiracy with &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/chelsea-manning&quot;&gt;Chelsea Manning&lt;/a&gt;, the former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, to “facilitate Manning’s acquisition and transmission of classified information related to the national defense of the United States so that WikiLeaks could publicly disseminate the information on its website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you think the editorial page of the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; would have reacted? (In July, 2010, the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; joined with the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; to publish tens of thousands of the documents that Manning provided to WikiLeaks.) What about the editorial page of the Washington &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, which published extensive stories about the leaked material? This material included video footage from 2007 of a U.S. Army Apache gunship carrying out an attack in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Iraqi civilians who were working for Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t know for sure, but it seems unlikely that the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; would have published an editorial that &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/assange-wikileaks-arrest.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “The administration has begun well by charging Mr. Assange with an indisputable crime.” It also seems unlikely that the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; would have published an editorial that &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/julian-assange-is-not-a-free-press-hero-and-he-is-long-overdue-for-personal-accountability/2019/04/11/90f901ba-5c86-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html?utm_term=.a8897074db36&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Mr. Assange’s case could conclude as a victory for the rule of law, not the defeat for civil liberties of which his defenders mistakenly warn.” Both of these statements were contained in editorials that the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, respectively, published on Thursday, after &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/julian-assange-versus-the-trump-administration&quot;&gt;Assange was arrested&lt;/a&gt;, in London, and Donald Trump’s Justice Department unsealed a federal &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-julian-assange-indictment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt; that federal prosecutors filed in Northern Virginia, last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a great deal has happened since 2014, much of it awful. During the 2016 Presidential election, Assange and WikiLeaks repeatedly published information that was damaging to the Democratic Party and to Hillary Clinton, timing the releases for maximum political damage. Assange denied that the Russian government was the source of this information, but, last summer, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, charged twelve Russian intelligence operatives with hacking D.N.C. servers and the e-mail account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign manager. Mueller’s indictment &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/7/13/17568806/mueller-russia-intelligence-indictment-full-text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the Russian spies “used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release additional stolen documents through a website maintained by an organization (‘Organization 1’),” which was WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he knew it or not, Assange was a key participant in an outrageous Russian effort to sow division inside this country and help Donald Trump. It is understandable that the events of 2016 have heavily colored perceptions of Assange’s arrest and possible extradition to the United States. (“Once in the United States, moreover, he could become a useful source on how Russia orchestrated its attacks on the Clinton campaign,” the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; editorial noted.) But it is important to recognize that the legal charges against him have nothing to do with Russia or the 2016 election. They relate exclusively to his dealings with Manning, in 2010. As numerous media watchdogs and civil-rights groups have already pointed out, they amount to a dangerous attack on the &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/12/julian-assange-charges-press-freedom-journalism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt; and on efforts by whistle-blowers to alert the public of the actions of powerful institutions, including the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In explaining the charges against Assange, the indictment’s “manners and means of the conspiracy” section describes many actions that are clearly legitimate journalistic practices, such as using encrypted messages, cultivating sources, and encouraging those sources to provide more information. It cites a text exchange in which Manning told Assange, “after this upload, that’s all I really have got left,” and Assange replied, “Curious eyes never run dry in my experience.” If that’s part of a crime, the authorities might have to start building more jails to hold reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment, and some of the commentary it engendered, also makes much of the fact that Assange offered to try to crack a computer password for Manning. The Department of Justice claims that this action amounted to Assange engaging in a “hacking” conspiracy. Even some independent commentators have suggested that it went beyond the bounds of legitimate journalism—and the protections of the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But did it? On Thursday, my colleague &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/raffi-khatchadourian&quot;&gt;Raffi Khatchadourian&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country&quot;&gt;written extensively about Assange&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out that, as of now, it looks like Assange didn’t do much, if anything, to crack the password once Manning sent the encrypted version. Khatchadourian also pointed out that federal prosecutors have known about this text exchange for many years, and yet the Obama Administration didn’t bring any charges. “As evidence of a conspiracy,” Khatchadourian writes, “the exchange is thin gruel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Assange had succeeded in decoding the encryption, it wouldn’t have given Manning access to any classified information she couldn’t have accessed through her own account. “Cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log onto the computers using a username that did not belong to her,” the indictment says. “Such a measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information.” So the goal was to protect Manning’s identity, and Assange offered to assist. But who could argue that trying to help a source conceal his or her identity isn’t something investigative journalists do on a routine basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Mahoney, the deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://cpj.org/2019/04/cpj-troubled-by-prosecution-of-julian-assange.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the indictment as “deeply troubling” because of the precedent it sets. “With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the U.S. government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest,” Mahoney warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editorial in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; did ultimately acknowledge “that the prosecution of Mr. Assange could become an assault on the First Amendment and whistle-blowers.” The &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; editorial didn’t even go that far. Instead, it ended by saying Assange “is long overdue for personal accountability.” Many people would agree with that statement. But it is important not to view absolutely everything through the prism of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ola Bini, Swedish Software Developer with Ties to Assange, Arrested in Ecuador</title>
<link>https://nypost.com/2019/04/12/software-engineer-close-to-julian-assange-arrested-while-trying-to-leave-ecuador/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nypost.com/2019/04/12/software-engineer-close-to-julian-assange-arrested-while-trying-to-leave-ecuador/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Swedish software engineer with close ties to Julian Assange was arrested while trying to leave Ecuador as authorities investigate the WikiLeaks founder’s alleged efforts to fight his eviction from the country’s embassy in London by blackmailing the country’s president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola Bini was arrested Thursday at Quito’s airport as he prepared to board a flight to Japan, a senior Ecuadorian official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swedish man by the same name describes himself on a blog as a software engineer working in Quito for the Center for Digital Autonomy, a group based in Ecuador and Spain focused on privacy, security and cryptography matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes no mention of any affiliation with WikiLeaks.On Twitter earlier Thursday, Bini called claims by the interior minister that Russian hackers and someone close to WikiLeaks were working inside Ecuador “very worrisome” news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This seems like a witch hunt to me,” Bini wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest came after &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-after-hes-evicted-from-embassy/&quot;&gt;police in London dragged Assange out of Ecuador’s embassy&lt;/a&gt; when his seven-year asylum was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had frequently traveled to Ecuador’s London embassy, Interior Minister María Paula Romo said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47903917&quot;&gt;according to the BBC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been detained simply for investigation purposes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A person close to Wikileaks, who has been residing in Ecuador, was arrested this afternoon when he was preparing to travel to Japan,” Ecuador’s interior ministry tweeted late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian officials believe Bini may be part of a blackmail ring assembled to pressure President Lenin Moreno and his government to allow Assange to remain in the embassy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ola-bini-swedish-software-developer-with-ties-to-assange-arrested-in-ecuador-cbnjvfmjq&quot;&gt;according to the Times of London.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian diplomats told their counterparts in the UK that they were worried that Assange’s associates would try to seek revenge with cyberattacks and information leaks if he was handed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain agreed to assist Ecuador in shoring up its cybersecurity, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorian government accused WikiLeaks of being behind an anonymous online campaign implicating Moreno and his family in alleged corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked materials — dubbed the “INA Papers” — also contained private photographs of Moreno and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreno, 66, said that Assange had no right to “hack private accounts and phones” without directly accusing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bini’s friends described him as a soft-spoken geek who is being unfairly accused of plotting to destabilize the Ecuadorian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vijay Prashad, who runs a Marxist publishing house based in India, considers himself a close pal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bini is “the last person who would ever be involved in an attempt overthrow a government,” he said, adding that he last saw Bini a few months ago in Sao Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler, a US-based computer programmer, tweeted: “I’m very concerned to hear that [he] has been arrested. He is a strong advocate and developer supporting privacy and has not been able to speak to any lawyers.”&lt;/p&gt;
