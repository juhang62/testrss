<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-07-12T00:00:00+00:00&quot;&gt;12 Jul 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I found and addressed some malicious code in the purescript npm installer. The malicious code was inserted into dependencies of the installer: specifically, packages maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;, the original author of the purescript npm installer, and also the maintainer (until around a month ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s some important background context I should explain first: after a few too many disagreements and unpleasant conversations with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt; about the maintenance of the purescript npm installer, we (the compiler maintainers) recently decided that it would be better if we maintained it ourselves, and asked him if he would transfer the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; package on npm to us. He begrudgingly did so. The 0.13.2 PureScript compiler release, which we cut last week, is the first release of the compiler since we took over the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; npm package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;quick-summary&quot;&gt;Quick summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Malicious code was added to various dependencies of the purescript npm installer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt; claims that the malicious code was published by an attacker who gained access to his npm account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as we are aware, the only purpose of the malicious code was to sabotage the purescript npm installer to prevent it from running successfully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latest version of the purescript npm installer, the malicious code has now been removed, and all dependencies of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;’s have been dropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to be absolutely sure you do not have malicious code on your machine, you should delete your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directories and your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; files, and set a lower bound of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.13.2&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;We are in ongoing discussion with npm support in order to ascertain what else we can do to mitigate the issue&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; npm have responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintainer of rate-map and load-from-cwd-or-npm has replied and informed us that they had not published the packages and feared that their account had been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have removed rate-map@1.0.3 and load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.2 from the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintainer also published install-purescript-cli@0.5.1, whose dependencies are pinned to load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.1 and rate-map@1.0.2. This was done to prevent purescript v0.12.x from installing malicious versions of load-from-cwd-or-npm and rate-map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-did-the-malicious-code-come-from&quot;&gt;Where did the malicious code come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was inserted first into the npm package &lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.com/package/load-from-cwd-or-npm&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at version 3.0.2, and later into the npm package &lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.com/package/rate-map&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; starting at version 1.0.3. A number of versions of both of these packages were published over the last few days, and many of them have now been unpublished. &lt;del&gt;As far as I can tell the only remaining version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt; including any malicious code is 3.0.2, and the only remaining version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map&lt;/code&gt; including any malicious code is version 1.0.3.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; npm have now removed both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map@1.0.3&lt;/code&gt; from the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-it-do&quot;&gt;What did it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the code sabotages the purescript npm installer to prevent the download from completing, making the installer hang during the “Check if a prebuilt binary is provided for your platform” step. The first exploit did this by breaking the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt; package so that any call to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loadFromCwdOrNpm()&lt;/code&gt; would return a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PassThrough&lt;/code&gt; stream instead of the package we were expecting (in this case, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; package, which we were using for downloading compiler binaries). The second iteration of the exploit did this by modifying a source file to prevent a download callback from firing. I’ve gone into more detail at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my current understanding of what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;33.562015503876&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 July, around 1300 UTC: PureScript 0.13.2 released, including version 0.13.2 of the npm package &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, multiple compiler maintainers were able to successfully install the compiler using the npm installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;15.209302325581&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 July, around 2100 UTC: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.2&lt;/code&gt; is published, with an exploit breaking the purescript npm installer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, this is the first published version of any of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;’s packages which includes any malicious code. Now, any person trying to install purescript will get the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon start receiving bug reports such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/purescript/npm-installer/issues/12&quot;&gt;purescript/npm-installer#12&lt;/a&gt;. We recommend that people use an alternative installation method while we figure out what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiler maintainers investigate, and for a while, we are stumped. It’s difficult to reliably reproduce, as the failure doesn’t occur in a local checkout of the purescript npm installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.8967391304348&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 0100 UTC: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/doolse&quot;&gt;@doolse&lt;/a&gt; identifies that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.2&lt;/code&gt; is the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/purescript/npm-installer/issues/12#issuecomment-509455840&quot;&gt;purescript/npm-installer#12 (comment)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/doolse&quot;&gt;@doolse&lt;/a&gt; opens an issue on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt; repo pointing out that the package is breaking the purescript npm installer (although at this stage, none of us spot that the code is malicious). This issue is later deleted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 0500 UTC: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.4&lt;/code&gt; is published, which no longer includes the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 0800 UTC: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map@1.0.3&lt;/code&gt; is published, which includes a more advanced version of the exploit, now with extra code which removes any trace of itself after it has run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 1100 UTC: Still not suspecting any bad faith, and thinking the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt; issue was a genuine bug, I publish a new version of the purescript npm installer which vendors a modified version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dl-tar&lt;/code&gt; which does not use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fixes the issue for some people, presumably those who have an older &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map&lt;/code&gt; pinned in their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; files. However, others are still able to reproduce the problem, because of the new version of the exploit which is now included in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.8736462093863&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 1130 UTC: I spot the malicious code in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map&lt;/code&gt;, and report it to npm support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now understanding that this is a deliberate act of bad faith, I start working on either vendoring or dropping all dependencies of the purescript npm installer which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt; maintains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9339622641509&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 July, around 1400 UTC: I publish a new version of the purescript npm installer in which every dependency of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;’s has been either dropped or vendored (and of course those which I vendored I also audited).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-has-this-been-addressed&quot;&gt;How has this been addressed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript-installer&lt;/code&gt; package, we have dropped all dependencies which are maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt; as of v0.2.5. We have also marked all earlier versions of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript-installer&lt;/code&gt; as deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you install the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; npm package at any version before 0.13.2, you will still be pulling in packages maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;. I’d suggest updating as soon as possible, or if you are still using 0.12.x, installing via some other means. We are currently in discussion with npm’s security team to discuss how best to resolve the issue of previous versions of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-the-exploits-work&quot;&gt;How did the exploits work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/hdgarrood/358e98b5956e5f7f59c85c2e56534f2b&quot;&gt;complete copies of the packages I’ve identified including the malicious code in a gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploit-version-1-load-from-cwd-or-npm&quot;&gt;Exploit version 1: load-from-cwd-or-npm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of the exploit, in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load-from-cwd-or-npm@3.0.2&lt;/code&gt;, occurs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/hdgarrood/358e98b5956e5f7f59c85c2e56534f2b#file-load-from-cwd-or-npm-3-0-2-js-L50-L83&quot;&gt;lines 50 to 83 of index.js&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'string'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is a little obfuscated but it didn’t take too long for me to work out what it is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tasks&lt;/code&gt; array initially contains just the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PassThrough&lt;/code&gt; stream constructor. The code then calls &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tasks.unshift&lt;/code&gt; twice so that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PassThrough&lt;/code&gt; constructor is at index 2 in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tasks&lt;/code&gt; array. This will be important later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop works its way up the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; chain to try to find out how the code is being run, by recursively inspecting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; property of each module in the chain. Then, we have this condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;endsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cli&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;existsSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.git&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this condition appears to be to decide whether or not to activate the malicious code. As far as I can tell, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;path.endsWith(&quot;cli&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; condition is designed to evaluate to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; on older versions of the purescript npm installer; before we took over, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt; npm package depended on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;install-purescript-cli&lt;/code&gt; package, which is maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;; in the most recent version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript&lt;/code&gt;, this dependency has been replaced with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;purescript-installer&lt;/code&gt; package, which we maintain. So the purpose of this condition seems to be to ensure that the malicious code only runs when our installer is being used (and not &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinnn&quot;&gt;@shinnn&lt;/a&gt;’s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second condition is checking whether there is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; directory alongside the file. The purpose of this is presumably to avoid activating the malicious code when the installer is being run out of a git working directory, to make it harder to reproduce and track down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; variable at this stage is just to indicate whether the malicious code should run or not: if the exploit should be run, then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, but if it shouldn’t, then it will be set to the string &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;npm&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. We then have this if statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'string'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which just returns the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PassThrough&lt;/code&gt; constructor in the case where the malicious code is being run; note that there are no other references to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;results[2]&lt;/code&gt; in the source file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of this is that when we do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loadFromCwdOrNpm(&quot;request&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, we get the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PassThrough&lt;/code&gt; constructor. So when we have code along the lines of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loadFromCwdOrNpm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;request&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https://github.com/.../archive.tar.gz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(...);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing happens; no HTTP request is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploit-version-2-rate-map&quot;&gt;Exploit version 2: rate-map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rate-map@1.0.3&lt;/code&gt; includes the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to control whether or not the exploit runs, although it also includes some interesting modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;15.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;108&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;116&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'dl-tar'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file path of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dl-tar&lt;/code&gt; package will now be stored in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;px&lt;/code&gt; variable. Then, we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;writeFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;__filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;__filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;utf8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/let parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;[^\0]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;*module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;exports/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;module.exports&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which rewrites the current file to remove the malicious code, presumably also in order to make this exploit harder to track down. Finally, we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;writeFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;utf8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;*cb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;null, chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which replaces any lines in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dl-tar&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file which match the regular expression &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/\n\s*cb\(null, chunk\);/&lt;/code&gt; with empty strings. When running this code against &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dl-tar@0.8.0&lt;/code&gt;, the latest version at the time of writing, it produces the following diff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-diff highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gd&quot;&gt;--- a/home/harry/code/purescript-npm-installer/dl-tar/index.js
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+++ b/node_modules/purescript-installer/dl-tar/index.js
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gu&quot;&gt;@@ -205,6 +205,7 @@ module.exports = function dlTar(...args) {
&lt;/span&gt;   new Transform({
     transform(chunk, encoding, cb) {
       unpackStream.responseBytes += chunk.length;
&lt;span class=&quot;gd&quot;&gt;-      cb(null, chunk);
&lt;/span&gt;     }
   }),
   unpackStream
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is, it removes the call to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cb&lt;/code&gt;, which means that the subscribers to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dlTar&lt;/code&gt; won’t fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;end-of-post&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;surprisingly popular&lt;/b&gt; answer is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd&quot; title=&quot;Wisdom of the crowd&quot;&gt;wisdom of the crowd&lt;/a&gt; technique that taps into the expert minority opinion within a crowd.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprisingly_popular#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For a given question, a group is asked both &quot;What do you think the right answer is?&quot; and &quot;What do you think the popular answer will be?&quot; The answer that maximizes the average difference between the &quot;right&quot; answer and the &quot;popular&quot; answer is the &quot;surprisingly popular&quot; answer.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprisingly_popular#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question to be determined:&lt;br/&gt;
Is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia&quot; title=&quot;Philadelphia&quot;&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; the capital of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania&quot; title=&quot;Pennsylvania&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions asked to the group and the response rates:&lt;br/&gt;
Is Philadelphia the capital of Pennsylvania?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes: 65%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No: 35%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think most people will respond to that question?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes: 75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No: 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the answers to the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; question and the &lt;i&gt;popular&lt;/i&gt; question:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes: 65% - 75% = -10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No: 35% - 25% = 10%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; answer is surprisingly popular (10% &amp;gt; -10%). Because of the relatively high margin of 10%, there can be high confidence that the correct answer is &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;. (The capital is indeed not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia&quot; title=&quot;Philadelphia&quot;&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Harrisburg&quot;&gt;Harrisburg&lt;/a&gt;.)

<title>Burnout</title>
<link>https://johnnyrodgers.is/burnout</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://johnnyrodgers.is/burnout</guid>
<description>&lt;em&gt;July 24, 2019&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have burned out twice – once at 26, once at 30. Each time it took months to come back and feel like myself again. Burnout affects everyone differently; it’s only in hindsight that I’ve been able to understand how it affected me, and learned to recognize the signs. After the second time I promised myself I wouldn’t let it happen again.&lt;p&gt;I just went through the toughest test of that resolve at 35, and I think I made it through this time without falling into the pit. If any of this sounds familiar, I hope learning from my experience might help you in yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the fall of 2009 I was at grad school studying technology design. I had gotten involved with an entry to the US Department of Energy’s annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solardecathlon.gov/&quot;&gt;Solar Decathlon&lt;/a&gt; competition, where teams from around the world design and build solar-powered homes and compete on various measures of efficiency, livability, and market viability. The competition culminates in a two-week long event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. where teams construct their (full-size) homes on site and participate in 10 competitions.&lt;p&gt;My team, made up of students from Simon Fraser University, University of Waterloo, and Ryerson University, had been working on our entry titled &lt;em&gt;North House&lt;/em&gt; for the better part of 2 years. We had aimed for the high end of the competition, with a very high-tech, high-design entry. I was responsible for the home automation and energy management systems with the team from SFU. We had built an embedded system that could control the shades, lights, and temperature of the house – even a controllable bed that could be raised into the ceiling. We had designed a sleek frontend displayed on touchscreens in the home, and a mobile app that the occupant could use to monitor and adjust their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1516&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; width_o=&quot;1516&quot; height_o=&quot;853&quot; src_o=&quot;https://cortex.persona.co/t/original/i/1d010a56102db44912169b1c3493fe5f957ee59f31272584d8df0d5051a49188/rvtr_north-house_01.jpg&quot; data-mid=&quot;748793&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;2006&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; width_o=&quot;2006&quot; height_o=&quot;1138&quot; src_o=&quot;https://cortex.persona.co/t/original/i/864823d0e5db76558f83fbc6df8d9231eb0a64a7cf1b293946953f15759e8b9e/rvtr_north-house_07.jpg&quot; data-mid=&quot;748794&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exterior and interior of North House&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had been working extremely long hours in the months leading up to the competition. Most of us on the project were learning our skillset and there was no shortage of hard problems that we were ill-equipped to solve. We showed up to Washington exhausted, and then spent two weeks on site in awful weather (the irony of a solar decathlon without sun), under incredible pressure and continued to work excessive hours. I remember sitting with my laptop on my knees at 1am on a dismal November night in the middle of the construction site, wearing a hard hat, trying to figure out why the home automation system wouldn’t come online. I got a terrible cold, and could hardly sleep from stress and anxiety that we would fail – that I would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We came &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solardecathlon.gov/past/2009/scoring/index.html&quot;&gt;4th out of 20 teams&lt;/a&gt;. What we built was incredible, and I still think proudly of the innovation and quality of the project: a house capable of net-positive energy production in a Canadian (Ontario) climate. The internal systems we built for the occupants of the home were ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I came home utterly depleted.&lt;/strong&gt; I had pushed myself far too hard and had lost all confidence in myself despite the outcome. I felt continuously weak and exhausted, and couldn’t shake the feeling of the meaninglessness of the effort for several months. At the time I willed myself to get over it and get back into the groove. Now I realize I was depressed for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Second time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In January 2014, I found myself in the midst of two simultaneous major projects. I had been working at Tiny Speck for nearly 2 years. After shutting down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glitchthegame.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, we reset and started making &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and were building toward our public release in February 2014. I was one of 8 people at the company – and the pace and level of commitment of everyone on the team was awe-inspiringly, intimidatingly high.&lt;p&gt;I was also launching a side project with my friend Connor Lowe: &lt;a href=&quot;https://montecristomagazine.com/magazine/summer-2014/give&quot;&gt;Give&lt;/a&gt; was an app that allowed music fans to give money directly to the artists they loved. We had been working on it since 2011 and were having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://33acresbrewing.com/andy-shauf/&quot;&gt;release party&lt;/a&gt; and event to celebrate featuring a &lt;a href=&quot;https://33acresbrewing.com/music-gift-andy-shauf/&quot;&gt;live concert with Andy Shauf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;1067&quot; width_o=&quot;1600&quot; height_o=&quot;1067&quot; src_o=&quot;https://cortex.persona.co/t/original/i/ff3a5c487eac4154d06a4520535af3d9abceaee07acbce5a73ceee3a1db18f16/andy_webready.jpg&quot; data-mid=&quot;748795&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Andy Shauf live at Music is a Gift&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; width_o=&quot;1024&quot; height_o=&quot;740&quot; src_o=&quot;https://cortex.persona.co/t/original/i/b1a3b6780a9c9c518b54781d1c956d69e3fe83e12859692e152c06a6ae6e34fe/7-2-Montecristo-Magazine-Summer-2014-upfront_page_1_image_0001.jpg&quot; data-mid=&quot;748796&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Me and Connor&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d been working my butt off on both projects. I would work 9-10 hours a day on Slack, then come home and put in another 3-4 on Give. I wasn’t sleeping much, and was ignoring the signs of stress that I should have recognized: headaches, anxiety, and persistent self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was learning a ton and proud of the work, but I was stretched to the breaking point. I accommodated this by ignoring my health, drinking more coffee and working harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Friday at work I started getting a pain in my stomach.&lt;/strong&gt; By the end of the day I could hardly sit up straight. My wife came to get me and I curled up in the car and hobbled into bed as soon as we got home. I started vomiting and spinning with terrible nausea. We eventually went to emergency and I spent the night with tubes down my throat while they did a battery of tests and images to try to figure out what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the next day, they still didn’t know what was up, so they recommended exploratory surgery. On Saturday night around 11pm I found myself on a gurney in a dark hallway in the basement of Vancouver General Hospital. For about 5 minutes while the medical staff went into the operating room to prep, I waited alone. That’s the only time in my life I’ve contemplated that I might be near death. It was a lonely, scary moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meckel%27s_diverticulum&quot;&gt;Meckel’s Diverticulum&lt;/a&gt; affects about 2% of people. Only about 2% of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people exhibit complications. In my case, complete obstruction of the intestine. Two laparoscopys and one laparotomy later, my diverticulum was out and my intestine was unblocked. Seven days later I was able to leave the hospital on two feet, albeit very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that I would have ended up in the hospital that night without work stress. But in hindsight, it’s clear to me that my body was pulling rank on my brain and stopping the line. I had gone way past my limits and paid a steep price for it. I was restricted in my diet and mobility for months. &lt;span&gt;I missed Give’s opening night and had to listen to the concert on headphones in the hospital bed a few days later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went back to work a week after leaving the hospital, and we shipped Slack to the world on February 12th.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Third time lucky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What’s common about these experiences? B&lt;span&gt;ig projects, b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ig responsibilities, b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ig deadlines, b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ig professional growth. &lt;/span&gt;Also common in these experiences is my lack of balance in attending to my mental and physical health, and in taking the world on my shoulders.&lt;p&gt;About 18 months ago I took on a new project at work &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/rebuilding-slack-on-the-desktop-308d6fe94ae4&quot;&gt;leading a rewrite of Slack’s desktop client&lt;/a&gt;. This involved a large, cross-functional team undertaking a significant technology migration and an ambitious new architecture. At the same time, we were making a generational investment and evolution in how we worked together as a company. Organizational growing pains compounded the difficulty of the technical aims of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the get-go I recognized that this project had the potential to burn me out. It’s something I care about a great deal, and that I’m personally and professionally deeply invested in. It’s big and ambitious and high-stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leaned into it – but &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; things would be different. I did not want to fall into depression, and I did not want to end up in the hospital. I also now have 2 kids at home; it was more than my own well-being on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; width_o=&quot;4032&quot; height_o=&quot;3024&quot; src_o=&quot;https://cortex.persona.co/t/original/i/7cd29f7dbcae70f70bf74d3a79508fd1060c0864914695d8fd23a9a34ac79c1e/IMG_20190617_201340.jpg&quot; data-mid=&quot;748797&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;small&gt;My amazing Slack people&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just shipped the project and I’m incredibly proud of what the team has achieved. I’m also deeply relieved that we got here without me having to pay that price again. In this case, immense credit goes to a deeply competent and collaborative set of colleagues to work with. I’ve also had a bit of time to think about what made the difference in my personal approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shocking no one, the things that helped avoid burnout were quite simple:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put health first.&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnnyrodgersis/status/1134301693229686785&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and not too many foreign substances. Whenever I found myself wanting to stay up past midnight to work, I’d call it quits instead. If I found myself taking my laptop home too many nights in a row, I’d leave it. It will always be there tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help and leeway.&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to my younger self, I was willing to ask my partner and my colleagues for help in ways that I haven’t been good at in the past. It’s extraordinarily freeing. In my personal life, it has deepened my relationship with my wife to be more honest about work stress and share the load I might be feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgive yourself and others for failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t take it personally when things don’t work out as you intend. Be honest about why and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate your work and personal life.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a major change for me. I’ve always identified very closely with my work. I’m learning to separate my sense of self-worth and purpose from my professional self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it professional.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a job, and it’s easier to do that job when you leave your emotional baggage at the door. It’s slowly becoming easier not to get wrapped up in every twist and turn of work life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This advice doesn’t get you very far. In the abstract, it’s just more self-help cliché. For me these are hard-won lessons, and it’s unlikely I would have done anything differently if someone had told me this when I was 26 or 30. The drive to push oneself is very powerful, and I wonder if it’s possible to know your own limits without first finding them and falling over the cliff a few times.&lt;p&gt;I know I never want to fall over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Safe Deposit Boxes Aren&amp;#039;t Safe</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the early 1980s, when Philip Poniz moved to New Jersey from Colorado, he needed a well-protected place to stash his collection of rare watches. He had been gathering unusual pieces since he was a teenager in 1960s Poland, fascinated by their intricate mechanics. His hobby became his profession, and by the time of his relocation, Mr. Poniz was an internationally known expert in the history and restoration of high-end timepieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At first, he kept his personal collection in his house, but as it grew, he wanted something more secure. The vault at his neighborhood bank seemed ideal. In 1983, he signed a one-page lease agreement with First National State Bank of Edison in Highland Park, N.J., for a safe deposit box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over the next few decades, the bank — a squat brick building on a low-rise suburban street — changed hands many times. First National became First Union, which was sold to Wachovia, which was then bought by Wells Fargo. But its vault remained the same. A foot-thick steel door sheltered cabinets filled with hundreds of stacked metal boxes, each protected by two keys. The bank kept one; the customer held the other. Both were required to open a box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1998, Mr. Poniz rented several additional boxes, and stored in them various items related to his work. He separated a batch of personal effects — photographs, coins he had inherited from his grandfather, dozens of watches — into a box labeled 105. Every time he opened it, he saw the glinting accumulation of his life’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then, on April 7, 2014, he lifted the thin metal lid. Box 105 was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I thought my heart would fail,” Mr. Poniz said. He paused in his retelling of the memory. At age 67, he has a strong Polish accent and speaks English carefully. He struggled to find the right words to describe the day he discovered his watches were missing. “I was devastated,” he said. “I was never like that in my life before. I had never known that one can have a feeling like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There are an estimated 25 million safe deposit boxes in America, and they operate in a legal gray zone within the highly regulated banking industry. There are no federal laws governing the boxes; no rules require banks to compensate customers if their property is stolen or destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every year, a few hundred customers report to the authorities that valuable items — art, memorabilia, diamonds, jewelry, rare coins, stacks of cash — have disappeared from their safe deposit boxes. Sometimes the fault lies with the customer. People remove items and then forget having done so. Others allow children or spouses access to their boxes, and don’t realize that they have been removing things. But even when a bank is clearly at fault, customers rarely recover more than a small fraction of what they’ve lost — if they recover anything at all. The combination of lax regulations and customers not paying attention to the fine print of their box-leasing agreements allows many banks to deflect responsibility when valuables are damaged or go missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The big banks fight tooth and nail, and prolong and delay — whatever it takes to wear people down,” said David P. McGuinn, the founder of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sdspec.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Safe Deposit Specialists&lt;/a&gt;, an industry consulting firm. “The larger the claim, the more likely they are to battle it for years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the days after Mr. Poniz found his box empty, he began piecing together what had happened: Wells Fargo had apparently tried to evict another customer for not keeping up with payments, and bank employees had mistakenly removed his box instead. After drilling No. 105 open, the bank shipped its contents to a storage facility in North Carolina. After Mr. Poniz discovered the loss, Wells Fargo sent back everything it had in storage, but some items had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;On April 7, 2014, Philip Poniz lifted the thin metal lid of Box 105.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a six-page report filed with the Highland Park Police, Mr. Poniz described the watches, coins, documents and other items that were gone. Using auction records and sales reports, he estimated that their combined value was more than $10 million. That would make it one of the largest safe-deposit-box losses in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-edk2dh eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6f44d2a&quot;&gt;Jason Bourne is not the norm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Moviemakers love safe deposit boxes much more than bank executives do. On film, they’re an essential tool for spies — Jason Bourne, for example, retrieved cash and passports from a Swiss box with the help of a device implanted in his hip — and a magnet for cunning thieves. Cinematic burglars have raided highly secured vaults by tunneling in (“The Bank Job”), drilling through a wall (“Sexy Beast”), disabling alarms (“King of Thieves”), taking hostages (“Inside Man”) or simply blowing off the doors (“The Dark Knight”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Real-world criminals have tried similarly spectacular attacks. In Conroe, Tex., someone &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.click2houston.com/news/thieves-break-into-bank-vault-through-roof-steal-money-heirlooms-victim-says&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cut through the roof of a bank&lt;/a&gt; last year and looted its safe deposit vault. Robbers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/nyregion/queens-bank-heist-leaves-dozens-of-deposit-boxes-on-roof.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;took a similar route&lt;/a&gt; three years ago into two banks in Brooklyn and Queens, where they left empty boxes scattered in their wake. (Four men were &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/four-men-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-their-roles-two-2016-bank-burglaries&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;convicted of the crime&lt;/a&gt;, which netted them more than $20 million in cash and goods.) But such capers are rare. Of the 19,000 bank robberies &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/bank-robbery/bank-crime-reports&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to the F.B.I. in the last five years, only 44 involved safe-deposit heists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Banks increasingly regard safe deposit boxes as more of a headache than they’re worth. They’re expensive to build, complicated to maintain and not very lucrative. The four largest American banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — rarely install them in new branches. Capital One stopped renting out new boxes in 2016. A dwindling number of customers wanted them, a bank spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“All of the major national banks would prefer to be out of the safe-deposit-box business,” said Jerry Pluard, the president of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://safedepositboxinsurance.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Safe Deposit Box Insurance Coverage&lt;/a&gt;, a small Chicago firm that insures boxes. “They view it as a legacy service that’s not strategic to anything they do, and they’ve stopped putting any real focus or resources into it.” He estimates that about half of the safe deposit boxes in the country are empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The number of bank branches in the United States has been steadily declining — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/february/why-banks-shuttering-branches&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;down 10 percent in the last decade&lt;/a&gt; — and safe deposit boxes are being relocated, evicted and sometimes misplaced. In Maryland, a large bank closed several branches and lost track of hundreds of safe deposit boxes, according to a lawsuit filed by a customer who said he lost gold and gems valued at $500,000. In Florida, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-bz-chase-valuables-lawsuit-20181226-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a customer accused Chase&lt;/a&gt; of losing her box and all of its contents — coins, jewelry and family heirlooms worth more than $100,000. (She sued; a federal judge ruled that she had waited too long to file her negligence claim and decided in the bank’s favor.) In California, a Wells Fargo customer said the bank &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://abc7news.com/archive/8973198/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accidentally re-rented her box&lt;/a&gt;; the diamond necklace and other jewels she had in it were never found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-edk2dh eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6161e0b1&quot;&gt;‘Safe’ doesn’t mean ‘safe’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When such cases go to court, the bank often has the upper hand. Lianna Saribekyan and her husband, Agassi Halajyan, leased a large safe deposit box at a Bank of America branch in Universal City, Calif., in 2012. They filled it with jewelry, cash, gemstones and family heirlooms that they wanted to keep safe as they renovated their home. They paid $246 for a one-year rental. Nine months later, Ms. Saribekyan returned to the branch and discovered that her box was gone. The Bank of America location was closing, employees told her; the bank had drilled open all of its safe deposit boxes. (The bank said it sent multiple letters to customers about the branch closure. Ms. Saribekyan said she never received them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Bank of America retrieved her items from its storage depot, many were missing. The bank’s own before-and-after inventories, written by its employees, showed discrepancies, according to court records. Among the items that vanished, Ms. Saribekyan said, were 44 loose diamonds, a gold-and-diamond necklace, valuable coins and more than $24,000 in rare United States currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She sued the bank in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking $7.3 million. Bank of America sought to have the case dismissed, citing language in its lease agreement stating that the renter “assumes all risks” of leaving property in the box. But in 2017, after a monthlong trial, a jury awarded Ms. Saribekyan $2.5 million for her lost items and an additional $2 million in punitive damages. Bank of America then challenged the verdict, arguing that any recovery should be restricted by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1419-bank-of-america-safe-deposit-b/a4a2ec35134500f23c01/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the terms detailed in its rental contract&lt;/a&gt;: “The bank’s liability for any loss in connection with the box for whatever reason shall not exceed ten (10) times the annual rent charged for the box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;One of Mr. Poniz’s remaining timepieces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew White for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Judge Rita Miller agreed. She reduced the compensation for lost items to $2,460 and cut the punitive damages to $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We were shocked, furious and in disbelief that such a thing could happen,” Mr. Halajyan said. “The attorneys were throwing stupid counterarguments at us, asking, ‘Why would you put so many valuables in the safe deposit box?’ We were like, where else do you want us to put it? The word ‘safe’ is supposed to mean ‘safe.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company’s restrictive terms aren’t unusual. Wells Fargo’s safe-deposit-box contract &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1425-wells-fargo-safe-deposit-box-l/a4a2ec35134500f23c01/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caps the bank’s liability at $500&lt;/a&gt;. Citigroup &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1424-citibank-safe-deposit-box-liab/a4a2ec35134500f23c01/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;limits it to 500 times the box’s annual rent&lt;/a&gt;, while JPMorgan Chase has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1418-chase-safe-deposit-box-liabili/a4a2ec35134500f23c01/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a $25,000 ceiling on its liability&lt;/a&gt;. Banks typically argue — and courts have in many cases agreed — that customers are bound by the bank’s most-current terms, even if they leased their box years or even decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No regulator formally tallies customer losses in safe deposit boxes. Mr. Pluard, who tracks legal filings and news reports, estimates that around 33,000 boxes a year are harmed by accidents, natural disasters and thefts. He often gets phone calls from people who are fighting their bank for compensation. “I tell them it’s hard, almost impossible,” he said. “What drives banks’ conduct is regulatory oversight, and none of the regulators pay any attention to safe deposit boxes. This just falls through the cracks. If the banks do something inappropriate, it’s very hard for customers to get any sort of relief.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the banking industry’s main federal overseer, said it had no grounds to get involved. “No provision of federal banking law expressly regulates safe deposit boxes,” said Bryan Hubbard, an agency spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And the scant protections offered by state laws are often simply ignored — as Mr. Poniz discovered when he began searching for the missing contents of his empty box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-edk2dh eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-7d5aef1&quot;&gt;The singing bird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For over a decade, Mr. Poniz’s Box 105 sat at the bottom of a seven-foot shelf in Wells Fargo’s Highland Park vault, accessible via a metal-barred door with an old-fashioned crank. But halfway up a different wall in the vault was another Box 105 — a product of the bank’s having consolidated several branches’ safe deposit boxes into a single location and having kept their original numbering. Bank employees got them mixed up, and emptied the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There’s no question that Wells Fargo drilled the box and took the contents out of it, put in storage and then returned it,” John North, a lawyer representing the bank, said at a court hearing last year. “The underlying dispute is, was everything returned or not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That isn’t really in dispute. When Wells Fargo employees opened Mr. Poniz’s box, they created an inventory that included 92 watches. When workers at the bank’s storage facility in North Carolina counted the items, they listed only 85. Also missing were dozens of rare coins that were listed in the first inventory, but not the second. According to Mr. Poniz, photographs and family documents also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;“My impression about safe deposit boxes was that it was like you were putting things in Fort Knox,” Mr. Poniz said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew White for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Oddly, the bank returned to him five watches that weren’t his. “They were the wrong color, the wrong size — totally different than what I had,” Mr. Poniz said. “I had no idea where they came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New Jersey law &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-17/section-17-14a-51/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;requires a bank to bring in an independent notary&lt;/a&gt; when it opens and empties a safe deposit box, and to place the box’s contents in a sealed package signed by the notary. The disappearance of the coins and watches suggests that Wells Fargo — which in recent years has admitted to systematically ripping off customers with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-warned-workers-against-fake-accounts-but-they-needed-a-paycheck.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;fake accounts&lt;/a&gt;, hidden fees and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/business/wells-fargo-sales-culture.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a variety of unwanted and unnecessary financial products&lt;/a&gt; — didn’t follow that law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Wells Fargo is reviewing the facts and circumstances of this case,” said Jim Seitz, a bank spokesman. “We cannot comment further due to pending litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Poniz hired lawyers. One of them, Kerry Gotlib, said he pressed the bank to find the missing items. It couldn’t. He asked for a financial settlement; the bank said no. So Mr. Poniz sued in New Jersey’s Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Wells Fargo sought to move the case into arbitration, a venue that keeps disputes out of the public record and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;tends to favor companies over the individuals challenging them&lt;/a&gt;. For nearly two years, the two sides battled over that request, until a judge ruled in November 2018 that the case should remain in court. Wells Fargo appealed, prolonging the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The lawsuit appears nowhere near resolution, and Mr. Poniz already has run up tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. “The bank has spent a tremendous amount of resources and put them into defending the case, instead of stepping forward and saying, ‘We made a mistake here, let’s make it right,’” said Craig Borgen, another lawyer representing Mr. Poniz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The watches that vanished were the largest and most visually striking in his collection, Mr. Poniz said. There was a Tiffany watch that tracked the moon’s phases on its gold dial, and an early Breguet engraved with the coat of arms of the Duke of Orléans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The highlight was a rare 19th-century pocket watch, whose face was dotted with pearls and rubies and concealed a pop-up bird, slightly larger than a thumbnail, that twittered and sang. Such “singing bird” watches rarely come to market. One of the last, in 1999, was sold at auction for $772,500 to the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Poniz, who spent a decade working at Sotheby’s and now consults for Christie’s as a horological expert, had hoped that the singing-bird watch would one day be the centerpiece of an auction of his own collection. He considered the trove to be his retirement fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“My impression about safe deposit boxes was that it was like you were putting things in Fort Knox,” he said. “Nothing could happen to it.” He doesn’t think that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>What Swimming Taught Me About Happiness</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/opinion/sunday/swimming-happiness.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/opinion/sunday/swimming-happiness.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One day, a few years ago, I was rushing from the pool dripping wet when a man with a Russian accent stopped me and said, “You must come to svim with the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I was in my early 50s — too old for swim team, I thought. But the coach — Igor was his name — persisted: “I see you are good svimmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Intrigued, and being a sucker for flattery, I relented and joined his ragtag group of swimmers. Workouts started at 5:30 in the morning, when most sane people were tucked in bed. It didn’t matter because no matter how sleepy we were, we were guaranteed to be wide-awake, if not euphoric, when we finished. We enjoyed our camaraderie and although we were all at different swimming levels, we had one thing in common: We wanted to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One day, a bunch of us were grousing about how little progress we were making in our swim times, how slow we were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ever the philosopher of the pool, Igor smiled and said, “You are all confused! Speed is not the goal; it is the result of perfect beautiful technique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What really mattered to Igor was excellence — the efficient stroke. Once you mastered that, he argued, speed would follow naturally. Speed was simply the welcome side effect of swimming well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I’ve been thinking lately that there’s a lesson here that goes beyond the pool. We all wanted to swim faster and the more hysterically we tried, the more speed escaped us. The same goes for happiness. Everyone wants to be happy, yet the more directly we pursue happiness, the more elusive it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We’ve all experienced this phenomenon. Think, for example, about your coming vacation. You are excited about going to the beach or mountains and relaxing with lots of free time. How happy you are going to be! Then you start to plan out what you’ll do, what you need to bring, what restaurants you need a reservation for. Soon you’re feeling a bit stressed out about your future pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-018-1436-7&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that thinking too much about how to be happy actually backfires and undermines well-being. This is in part because all that thinking consumes a fair amount of time, and is not itself enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The researchers behind this study, called “Vanishing Time in the Pursuit of Happiness,” randomly assigned subjects to one of two tasks: One group was asked to write down 10 things that could make them become happier, while the other wrote 10 things that demonstrated that they were already happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The subjects were then asked to what extent they felt time was slipping away and how happy they felt at that moment. Those prompted to think about how they could become happier felt more pressed for time and significantly less happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This jibes with the argument the journalist Ruth Whippman makes in her 2016 book “America the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks.” Trying too hard to be happy — downloading mindfulness apps, taking yoga classes, reading self-help books — mostly just stresses us out, she writes. So what should we do instead? Maybe simply hang out with some friends, doing something we like to do together: “Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Which brings me back to swimming. When I swim, I feel that I have all the time in the world, in part because much of what marks time — my everyday life — vanishes the moment I step in the water. And all the while I’m there with my buddies, bound by mutual exertion and joking about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Our technique has improved, thanks to Igor. We have a smoother pull, never dropping our elbows, and a steadier flutter kick. Some days, I swim a little faster than I did before. But even if I don’t, I feel great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the end, happiness is a side effect of living well — just like speed can be the result of excellent swimming technique. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meal timing strategies appear to lower appetite, improve fat burning</title>
<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190724103702.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190724103702.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Researchers have discovered that meal timing strategies such as intermittent fasting or eating earlier in the daytime appear to help people lose weight by lowering appetite rather than burning more calories, according to a report published online today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;, the flagship journal of The Obesity Society. The study is the first to show how meal timing affects 24-hour energy metabolism when food intake and meal frequency are matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;124&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coordinating meals with circadian rhythms, or your body's internal clock, may be a powerful strategy for reducing appetite and improving metabolic health,&quot; said Eric Ravussin, PhD, one of the study's authors and associate executive director for clinical science at Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We suspect that a majority of people may find meal timing strategies helpful for losing weight or to maintain their weight since these strategies naturally appear to curb appetite, which may help people eat less,&quot; said Courtney M. Peterson, PhD, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition Sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson and her colleagues also report that meal timing strategies may help people burn more fat on average during a 24-hour period. Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) -- a form of daily intermittent fasting where dinner is eaten in the afternoon -- helped to improve people's ability to switch between burning carbohydrates for energy to burning fat for energy, an aspect of metabolism known as metabolic flexibility. The study's authors said, however, that the results on fat-burning are preliminary. &quot;Whether these strategies help people lose body fat need to be tested and confirmed in a much longer study,&quot; said Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers enrolled 11 adult men and women who had excess weight. Participants were recruited between November 2014 and August 2016. Adults, in general good health, aged 20-to-45-years old were eligible to participate if they had a body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (inclusive), body weight between 68 and 100 kg, a regular bedtime between 9:30 p.m. and 12 a.m., and for women, a regular menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants tried two different meal timing strategies in random order: a control schedule where participants ate three meals during a 12-hour period with breakfast at 8:00 a.m. and dinner at 8:00 p.m. and an eTRF schedule where participants ate three meals over a six-hour period with breakfast at 8:00 a.m. and dinner at 2:00 p.m. The same amounts and types of foods were consumed on both schedules. Fasting periods for the control schedule included 12 hours per day, while the eTRF schedule involved fasting for 18 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study participants followed the different schedules for four days in a row. On the fourth day, researchers measured the metabolism of participants by placing them in a respiratory chamber -- a room-like device -- where researchers measured how many calories, carbohydrates, fat and protein were burned. Researchers also measured the appetite levels of participants every three hours while they were awake, as well as hunger hormones in the morning and evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although eTRF did not significantly affect how many calories participants burned, the researchers found that eTRF did lower levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and improved some aspects of appetite. It also increased fat-burning over the 24-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By testing eTRF, we were able to kill two birds with one stone,&quot; said Peterson, adding that the researchers were able to gain some insight into daily intermittent fasting (time restricted-feeding), as well as meal timing strategies that involve eating earlier in the daytime to be in sync with circadian rhythms. The researchers believe that these two broader classes of meal timing strategies may have similar benefits to eTRF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollie Raynor, PhD, RD, LDN, who was not associated with the research, said &quot;this study helps provide more information about how patterns of eating, and not just what you eat, may be important for achieving a healthy weight.&quot; Raynor is a professor and interim dean of research in the Department of Nutrition, College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson and colleagues said prior research was conflicted on whether meal timing strategies help with weight loss by helping people burn more calories or by lowering appetite. Studies in rodents suggest such strategies burn more calories, but data from human studies were conflicting -- some studies suggested meal timing strategies increase calories burned, but other reports showed no difference. The study's authors said, however, that previous studies did not directly measure how many calories people burned or were imperfect in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Roots of Boeing’s 737 Max Crisis: A Regulator Relaxes Its Oversight</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/business/boeing-737-max-faa.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/business/boeing-737-max-faa.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SEATTLE — In the days after the first crash of Boeing’s 737 Max, engineers at the Federal Aviation Administration came to a troubling realization: They didn’t fully understand the automated system that helped send the plane into a nose-dive, killing everyone on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Engineers at the agency scoured their files for information about the system designed to help avoid stalls. They didn’t find much. Regulators had never independently assessed the risks of the dangerous software known as MCAS when they approved the plane in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More than a dozen current and former employees at the F.A.A. and Boeing who spoke with The New York Times described a broken regulatory process that effectively neutered the oversight authority of the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The regulator had been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/politics/boeing-faa.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;passing off routine tasks&lt;/a&gt; to manufacturers for years, with the goal of freeing up specialists to focus on the most important safety concerns. But on the Max, the regulator handed nearly complete control to Boeing, leaving some key agency officials in the dark about &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/business/boeing-faa-mcas.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;important systems like MCAS&lt;/a&gt;, according to the current and former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the agency’s flawed oversight of the Boeing 737 Max has attracted much scrutiny since the first crash in October and a second one in March, a Times investigation revealed previously unreported details about weaknesses in the regulatory process that compromised the safety of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company performed its own assessments of the system, which were not stress-tested by the regulator. Turnover at the agency left two relatively inexperienced engineers overseeing Boeing’s early work on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. eventually handed over responsibility for approval of MCAS to the manufacturer. After that, Boeing didn’t have to share the details of the system with the two agency engineers. They weren’t aware of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;its intricacies,&lt;/a&gt; according to two people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Late in the development of the Max, Boeing decided to expand the use of MCAS, to ensure the plane flew smoothly. The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;new, riskier version&lt;/a&gt; relied on a single sensor and could push down the nose of the plane by a much larger amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing did not submit a formal review of MCAS after the overhaul. It wasn’t required by F.A.A. rules. An engineering test pilot at the regulator knew about the changes, according to an agency official. But his job was to evaluate the way the plane flew, not to determine the safety of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agency ultimately certified the jet as safe, required little training for pilots and allowed the plane to keep flying until a second deadly Max crash, less than five months after the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plane remains grounded as regulators await a fix from Boeing. If the ban persists much longer, Boeing said this past week that it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/business/boeing-earnings-737-max.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;could be forced to halt production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. and Boeing have defended the plane’s certification, saying they followed proper procedures and adhered to the highest standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The agency’s certification processes are well-established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,” the regulator said in a statement Friday. “The 737 Max certification program involved 110,000 hours of work on the part of F.A.A. personnel, including flying or supporting 297 test flights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing said “the F.A.A.’s rigor and regulatory leadership has driven ever-increasing levels of safety over the decades,” adding that “the 737 Max met the F.A.A.’s stringent standards and requirements as it was certified through the F.A.A.’s processes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[If you have worked at Boeing or the F.A.A. and want to discuss your experience,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/tips?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;contact The Times confidentially here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s one of the things we’re looking at,” said Chris Hart, the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is now leading a multiagency task force investigating how the Max was approved. “As it evolved from a less robust system to a more powerful system, were the certifiers aware of the changes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing needed the approval process on the Max to go swiftly. Months behind &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;its rival Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, the company was racing to finish the plane, a more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling 737.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The regulator’s hands-off approach was pivotal. At crucial moments in the Max’s development, the agency operated in the background, mainly monitoring Boeing’s progress and checking paperwork. The nation’s largest aerospace manufacturer, Boeing was treated as a client, with F.A.A. officials making decisions based on the company’s deadlines and budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It has long been a cozy relationship. Top agency officials have shuffled between the government and the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the Max certification, senior leaders at the F.A.A. sometimes overruled their own staff members’ recommendations after Boeing pushed back. For safety reasons, many agency engineers wanted Boeing to redesign a pair of cables, part of a major system unrelated to MCAS. The company resisted, and F.A.A. managers took Boeing’s side, according to internal agency documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/world/asia/indonesia-lion-air-crash-.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;crash of the Lion Air&lt;/a&gt; plane last October, F.A.A. engineers were shocked to discover they didn’t have a complete analysis of MCAS. The safety review in their files didn’t mention that the system could aggressively push down the nose of the plane and trigger repeatedly, making it difficult to regain control of the aircraft, as it did on the doomed Lion Air flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Despite their hazy understanding of the system, F.A.A. officials decided against grounding the 737 Max. Instead, they &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published a notice&lt;/a&gt; reminding pilots of existing emergency procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The notice didn’t describe how MCAS worked. At the last minute, an F.A.A. manager told agency engineers to remove the only mention of the system, according to internal agency documents and two people with knowledge of the matter. Instead, airlines learned about it from Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3c707497&quot;&gt;‘He really wanted abdication.’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. department that oversaw the Max development had such a singular focus that it was named after the company: The Boeing Aviation Safety Oversight Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many F.A.A. veterans came to see the department, created in 2009, as a symbol of the agency’s close relationship with the manufacturer. The top official in Seattle at the time, Ali Bahrami, had a tough time persuading employees to join, according to three current and former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some engineers believed that Mr. Bahrami had installed managers in the office who would defer to Boeing. “He didn’t put enough checks and balances in the system,” Mike McRae, a former F.A.A. engineer, said of Mr. Bahrami. “He really wanted abdication. He didn’t want delegation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before the certification of the Max began, Mr. Bahrami called a group of F.A.A. engineers into his office, the current and former employees said, and asked some of them to join the group. Many didn’t want to change jobs, according to a complaint filed by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing F.A.A. engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I got dragged kicking and screaming,” said Richard Reed, a former systems engineer at the F.A.A. Mr. Reed said he had just left surgery when agency officials called to ask whether he would work in the office. “I always claimed that I was on drugs when I said ‘yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. said in a statement that Mr. Bahrami “dedicated his career to the advancement of aviation safety in both the private and public sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;F.A.A. offices in Des Moines, Wash. The way the agency dealt with Boeing left engineers at the agency demoralized, two employees said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth Fremson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For decades, the F.A.A. relied on engineers inside Boeing to help certify aircraft. But after intense lobbying to Congress by industry, the agency adopted rules in 2005 that would give manufacturers like Boeing even more control. Previously, the agency selected the company engineers to work on its behalf; under the new regulations, Boeing could choose them, though the F.A.A. has veto power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many of the agency’s top leaders embraced the approach. It would allow the F.A.A. to certify planes more efficiently and stretch its limited resources. The regulator had also been finding it harder to compete for talented engineers, their government salaries unable to keep up with the going rates in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For Boeing, the changes meant shedding a layer of bureaucracy. “The process was working well,” said Tom Heineman, a retired Boeing engineer who worked on the Max. “The F.A.A. was delegating more of the work and the review and the oversight to the manufacturers than it used to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But some F.A.A. engineers were concerned that they were no longer able to effectively monitor what was happening inside Boeing. In a PowerPoint presentation to agency managers in 2016, union representatives raised concerns about a “brain drain” and the “inability to hire and retain qualified personnel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By 2018, the F.A.A. was letting the company certify 96 percent of its own work, according to an agency official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nicole Potter, an F.A.A. propulsion and fuel systems engineer who worked on the Max, said supervisors repeatedly asked her to give up the right to approve safety documents. She often had to fight to keep the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Leadership was targeting a high level of delegation,” Ms. Potter said. When F.A.A. employees didn’t have time to approve a critical document, she said, “managers could delegate it back to Boeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was a process Mr. Bahrami championed to lawmakers. After spending more than two decades at the F.A.A., he left the agency in 2013 and took a job at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group that represents Boeing and other manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We urge the F.A.A. to allow maximum use of delegation,” Mr. Bahrami told Congress in his new lobbying role, arguing it would help American manufacturers compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2017, Mr. Bahrami returned to the F.A.A. as the head of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-629d5275&quot;&gt;An internal battle at the F.A.A.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With Boeing taking more control, F.A.A. engineers found they had little power, even when they did raise concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Early on, engineers at the F.A.A. discovered a problem with one of the most important new features of the Max: its engines. The Max, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/business/boeing-737-max-.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the latest version of the 50-year-old 737,&lt;/a&gt; featured more fuel-efficient engines, with a larger fan and a high-pressure turbine. But the bigger, more complex engines could do more damage if they broke apart midair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. engineers were particularly concerned about pieces hitting the cables that control the rudder, according to five people with knowledge of the matter and internal agency documents. A cable severed during takeoff would make it difficult for pilots to regain control, potentially bringing down the jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. engineers suggested a couple solutions, three of the people said. The company could add a second set of cables or install a computerized system for controlling the rudder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing did not want to make a change, according to internal F.A.A. documents reviewed by The Times. A redesign could have caused delays. Company engineers argued that it was unlikely that an engine would break apart and shrapnel would hit the rudder cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the F.A.A. engineers working on the issue insisted the change was necessary for safety reasons, according to internal agency emails and documents. But their supervisors balked. In a July 2015 meeting, Jeff Duven, who replaced Mr. Bahrami as the head of the F.A.A.’s Seattle operation, sided with Boeing, said two current employees at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Boeing Max planes in Renton, Wash. The company downplayed the risks of the software, MCAS, to federal officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth Fremson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;F.A.A. managers conceded that the Max “does not meet” agency guidelines “for protecting flight controls,” according to an agency document. But in another document, they added that they had to consider whether any requested changes would interfere with Boeing’s timeline. The managers wrote that it would be “impractical at this late point in the program,” for the company to resolve the issue. Mr. Duven at the F.A.A. also said the decision was based on the safety record of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Engineers at the agency were demoralized, the two agency employees said. One engineer submitted an anonymous complaint to an internal F.A.A. safety board, which was reviewed by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“During meetings regarding this issue the cost to Boeing to upgrade the design was discussed,” the engineer wrote. “The comment was made that there may be better places for Boeing to spend their safety dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An F.A.A. panel investigated the complaint. It found managers siding with Boeing had created “an environment of mistrust that hampers the ability of the agency to work effectively,” the panel said in a 2017 report, which was reviewed by The Times. The panel cautioned against allowing Boeing to handle this kind of approval, saying “the company has a vested interest in minimizing costs and schedule impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By then, the panel’s findings were moot. Managers at the agency had already given Boeing the right to approve the cables, and they were installed on the Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-c392ddc&quot;&gt;Playing down risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the middle of the Max’s development, two of the most seasoned engineers in the F.A.A.’s Boeing office left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The engineers, who had a combined 50 years of experience, had joined the office at its creation, taking on responsibility for flight control systems, including MCAS. But they both grew frustrated with the work, which they saw as mostly paper pushing, according to two people with knowledge of the staff changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In their place, the F.A.A. appointed an engineer who had little experience in flight controls, and a new hire who had gotten his master’s degree three years earlier. People who worked with the two engineers said they seemed ill-equipped to identify any problems in a complex system like MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And Boeing played down the importance of MCAS from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An early review by the company didn’t consider the system risky, and it didn’t prompt additional scrutiny from the F.A.A. engineers, according to two agency officials. The review described a system that would activate only in rare situations, when a plane was making a sharp turn at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. engineers who had been overseeing MCAS never received another safety assessment. As Boeing raced to finish the Max in 2016, agency managers gave the company the power to approve a batch of safety assessments — some of the most important documents in any certification. They believed the issues were low risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One of the managers, Julie Alger, delegated the review of MCAS. Previously, the F.A.A. had the final say over the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. said that decision reflected the consensus of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing was in the middle of overhauling MCAS. To help pilots control the plane and avoid a stall, the company allowed MCAS to trigger at low speeds, rather than just at high speeds. The overhauled version would move the stabilizer by as much as 2.5 degrees each time it triggered, significantly pushing down the nose of the plane. The earlier version moved the stabilizer by 0.6 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When company engineers analyzed the change, they figured that the system had not become any riskier, according to two people familiar with Boeing’s discussions on the matter. They assumed that pilots would respond to a malfunction in three seconds, quickly bringing the nose of the plane back up. In their view, any problems would be less dangerous at low speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So the company never submitted an updated safety assessment of those changes to the agency. In several briefings in 2016, an F.A.A. test pilot learned the details of the system from Boeing. But the two F.A.A. engineers didn’t understand that MCAS could move the tail as much as 2.5 degrees, according to two people familiar with their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under the impression the system was insignificant, officials didn’t require Boeing to tell pilots about MCAS. When the company asked to remove mention of MCAS from the pilot’s manual, the agency agreed. The F.A.A. also did not mention the software in 30 pages of detailed descriptions noting differences between the Max and the previous iteration of the 737.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Days after the Lion Air crash, the agency invited Boeing executives to the F.A.A.’s Seattle headquarters, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The officials sat incredulous as Boeing executives explained details about the system that they didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the middle of the conversation, an F.A.A. employee, one of the people said, interrupted to ask a question on the minds of several agency engineers: Why hadn’t Boeing updated the safety analysis of a system that had become so dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
