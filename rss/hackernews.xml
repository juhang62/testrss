<title>Startups are pummeled in the ‘great unwinding’</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — After a crush of travel cancellations in March, WanderJaunt, a short-term home rental start-up in San Francisco, laid off 56 of its 240 employees last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Demand for services from Wonderschool, a start-up that helps people find day care and preschool providers, dropped by half, leading it to cut most of its 60-person staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And at ClassPass, which offers a membership program for fitness classes, over 95 percent of revenue evaporated in just 10 days as studios and gyms around the world shut down. To survive, the start-up slashed spending, froze hiring and rushed to build a video streaming service for virtual workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is the great unwinding,” said Martin Pichinson, head of Sherwood Partners, a Silicon Valley advisory firm that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/business/a-new-technology-now-that-new-is-old.html?searchResultPosition=4&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;restructures failed start-ups&lt;/a&gt;. In recent weeks, he said, his firm has fielded a “firestorm” of calls — a volume three or four times the highest he had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Start-ups have always been risky, designed to grow fast or die, but the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;state=default&amp;amp;module=styln-coronavirus&amp;amp;variant=show&amp;amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;amp;context=storyline_menu&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; is turbocharging Silicon Valley’s natural selection and causing a shake-up so sudden it has defied comparison. In just a few weeks, more than 50 start-ups have cut or furloughed roughly 6,000 employees, according to a tally by The New York Times. Plans for initial public offerings are on hold. And funding is drying up for many young tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The fallout is hitting the highest-profile start-ups as well as the smaller ones trying to disrupt them. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/technology/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;, the home rental start-up valued at $31 billion, has stopped hiring and has suspended $800 million of marketing. Bird, an electric scooter start-up, laid off 30 percent of its staff last week, while Everlane, an apparel company, cut or furloughed hundreds of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The real estate start-ups Knotel and Convene have laid off or furloughed half of their workers. The hiring site ZipRecruiter cut around 40 percent of its staff. OneWeb, a satellite start-up that had raised $3 billion in venture funding from investors including SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, filed for bankruptcy on Friday and plans to sell itself. And travel start-ups — Vacasa, Sonder, Inspirato, Zeus Living and TripActions, among others — have been some of the hardest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor, a workplace review and job listings site, said the situation facing start-ups now was worse than in downturns like the dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the financial crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The coronavirus outbreak is economically akin to a major hurricane occurring in every state around the country for weeks on end,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The numbers are stark. In March, job listings at the 30 most valuable start-ups in the United States dropped 19 percent, or an average of 21 jobs each, according to Thinknum Alternative Data, a research company. Start-up funding in the first three months of 2020 was also on a pace for its second-steepest quarterly decline in 10 years, said CB Insights, which tracks start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Start-ups in some areas — telemedicine, food delivery, online learning, remote work, gaming — are thriving amid the quarantines. And there were signs that the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/technology/tech-start-up-boom-deflate.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;boom times were shaky&lt;/a&gt; even before the coronavirus brought wide swaths of the U.S. economy to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the pain is now deeper and most likely just beginning, especially as investors, already bruised by a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/business/tech-ipo-market.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;string of disappointing I.P.O.s last year&lt;/a&gt;, become even more cautious. On March 5, Sequoia Capital, a top venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, issued a warning to start-ups, calling Covid-19 “the black swan of 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Bill Gurley, an investor at the venture capital firm Benchmark, said that over the past 10 years of the start-up boom, investors had taken on more and more risk. That has changed, leaving many of the riskiest start-ups exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“‘Risk on’ happens slowly,” he said. “‘Risk off’ happens overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-2193abe9&quot;&gt;Let Go With Little Warning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For start-up workers, the past few weeks have been sobering. Many had bought into the tech industry’s change-the-world ideals, had few boundaries between their work and personal lives and hoped for big payouts if their start-ups went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now they were being laid off over video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At Bird, the Los Angeles scooter start-up, which had once been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/technology/bird-scooters-valuation.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;valued&lt;/a&gt; at as much as $2.5 billion, hundreds of employees were invited to a video conference call on Friday morning with just an hour’s notice. On the call, the voice of an unidentified executive explained that their jobs had been eliminated. A slide outlined the terms: a month of severance pay, three months of medical benefits and one year to exercise their stock options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The workers were asked to mail in their laptops, said Jenny Alvauaje, a Bird data analyst who was on the call. Some workers missed the call but learned they had been laid off when they lost access to internal systems shortly after, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement that called the layoffs “a difficult decision,” a Bird spokeswoman added, “We purposefully and intentionally did not have any video on to protect privacy as we delivered the news live to individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The end was equally abrupt for Nik Buenning, 40, a data scientist at Panoramic, a marketing software start-up in Los Angeles. He was just settling into his work-from-home setup on March 23 when a companywide email said to expect a call from human resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Right away, he said, “people started sending Slack messages like, ‘I’m out.’ ‘I’m out.’ ‘I’m out.’” An hour later, he was out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Buenning signed up for &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://upstreamapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upstream&lt;/a&gt;, a new networking app that unveiled itself earlier than planned to cater to tech workers affected by coronavirus layoffs. Sites like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.getsilverlining.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silver Lining&lt;/a&gt; are also helping people connect with companies that are still hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many start-up workers have added their names to Google spreadsheets, which recruiters share in weekly newsletters like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.layoffs.tech/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Layoff List&lt;/a&gt;, created by a recruiting company called Drafted. Hiring managers, venture capitalists and start-up advisers read the newsletter, said Vinayak Ranade, chief executive of Drafted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some laid-off workers said they might flee to the safety of the largest tech companies, which are sitting on piles of cash and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-facebook-amazon-youtube.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;benefiting from increased use in the quarantines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Kenyon Brown, 24, a product manager, left his job early this year at Mariana Tek, a software company in Washington, he had eight or nine promising job leads at start-ups. Those quickly evaporated as the virus spread. He said he was now more open to big tech companies since they were still hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The situation “has definitely forced me to think about my short-term career in another light,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-2a14d3cc&quot;&gt;Survival Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The start-up survival guide reads something like this: Cut spending, lower prices on products, renegotiate fixed costs for things like leases and ask the government for assistance for the fitness studios, home rental operators or gig workers they rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some entrepreneurs said they viewed the coronavirus as a moment to rally around their company’s mission, citing the “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo-2/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wartime C.E.O&lt;/a&gt;.” idea popularized among start-ups by the venture capitalist Ben Horowitz. It states that executives facing an “imminent existential threat” do whatever it takes to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There are no distractions now,” said Michael Chen, 30, chief executive of WanderJaunt, the short-term home rental start-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Chen’s four-year-old company, which had raised $27 million in funding, has slashed its prices; a house that rented for $700 a night now goes for $100, for instance. And it has switched its focus from vacation travelers to those displaced by the virus, like stranded college students, people seeking a separate work space or medical workers isolating themselves from family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At Sonder, a travel start-up in San Francisco that laid off 282 people and furloughed 135 of its 1,254 workers last week, the speed of decision-making has increased from a few days to a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“In many ways it’s energizing, but it’s also quite chaotic,” said Francis Davidson, chief executive of Sonder, which raised $345 million in funding and was valued at $1.1 billion. He said his investors had advised him to cut fast and deep to allow employees to hit the job market before things got worse and to avoid multiple rounds of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“People that are looking for a really coddled environment should not be in start-up land,” he said. “You need to have thick skin and a high adversity quotient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6bb222bd&quot;&gt;‘A Time of Weeding Out’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many venture capital firms are flush with cash from record-breaking hauls in recent years. But they may not decide to use the money to keep struggling start-ups alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There’s no doubt that this will be a time of weeding out of start-ups that can’t survive,” said Mike Jones, an investor at the venture capital firm Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One venture capital firm in San Francisco, Alpha Bridge Ventures, said it was too small to pour more money into its start-up investments. The firm has made a promise to the founders it has backed: If their companies fail because of the coronavirus, it will give them $25,000 for their next company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We can at least take one burden off their shoulders,” said Jake Chapman, an investor at Alpha Bridge, adding that two or three of the firm’s 21 investments are at risk of failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In lieu of networking events and lavish retreats, venture firms are now dispensing advice in blog posts, on Twitter and at virtual panels over Zoom. At a March start-ups event, Alexis Ohanian, an investor at Initialized Capital in San Francisco, encouraged founders to adapt to the new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If what you’re doing now is just not a viable solution in this new world and in a different economy,” he said, “then find something that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Yet another novel I will no longer write</title>
<link>https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2020/04/reality-keeps-stealing-my-line.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2020/04/reality-keeps-stealing-my-line.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;asset-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, some years ago I blogged a whole bunch of times about books I wasn't going to write for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to COVID-19, I can add another to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you have been waiting years (is it really a decade? Gosh!) for a third book in the would-be trilogy that began with &lt;em&gt;Halting State&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rule 34&lt;/em&gt;. The third Scottish near-future police procedural kept getting put back and back because reality wouldn't sit still and behave itself: it's really hard to write something set 10 years in the future (or even 5) if you don't even know what the country it's set in is going to be called. I named the period starting in 2012 &quot;the Scottish political singularity&quot;, because it made all near-future fiction set in Scotland problematic: first we had the referendum on independence from the UK, then a general election, then the Brexit referendum. Back in 2012 I thought things would have settled down by 2016 or so: alas, I was sadly disillusioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So around 2016 I hatched a Plan B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Had, past tense.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;more&quot; class=&quot;asset-more&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B was to make my near-future Scottish thriller so hyper-specific that the big political questions wouldn't impinge on the plot &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. And I had a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; plot, and even wrote the first thousand or so words of the untitled novel as a story seed. I just needed to clear my desk, finish &lt;em&gt;Invisible Sun&lt;/em&gt; (FX: sound of author weeping helplessly) and finish the new space opera ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you know what happened: delays due to people dying, an apocalyptic drum-beat of bad news in the background, and so on and so forth. But I thought I might &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; get time to start writing the Scottish Novel in earnest, starting in mid- to late-2022 ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then COVID-19 came along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the third Scottish crime novel was to be a zombie pandemic novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several bees in my metaphorical bonnet—in fact, an entire angry swarm of them—when it comes to the standard zombie narrative in post-apocalypse fiction. The zombie myth has roots in Haitian slave plantations: they're fairly transparently about the slaves' fear of being forced to toil endlessly even after their death. Then this narrative got appropriated and transplanted to America, in film, TV, and fiction. Where it hybridized with white settler fear of a slave uprising. The survivors/protagonists of the zombie plague are the viewpoint the audience is intended to empathize with, but their response to the shambling horde is as brutal and violent as any plantation owner's reaction to their slaves rising, and it speaks to a peculiarly American cognitive disorder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2013/04/14/elite-panic-why-rich-people-t.html&quot;&gt;elite panic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elite panic is the phenomenon by which rich and/or privileged people imagine that in times of chaos all social constraints break down and everyone around them will try to rob, rape, and murder them. To some extent this reflects their own implicit belief that humanity is by nature grasping, avaricious, amoral, and cruel, and that their status depends on power and violence. It's a world-view you'd expect of unreconstructed pre-Enlightenment aristocrats, or maybe a society dominated by a violent slave-owning elite. It's also fundamentally &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Usually whenever there's a major disaster, people look after their families ... and then their friends and neighbours, pulling together and trying to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's noteworthy that Zombie Apocalypse fic and Pandemic Dystopia fic overlap considerably, and people get both aspects right and wrong to different degrees. (I'd like to give a shout-out at this point to Seanan McGuire who, as Mira Grant, gave us the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rising-Newsflesh-Trilogy-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B07DHJNKW2/&quot;&gt;Newsflesh trilogy&lt;/a&gt;. Her zombies are, well, conventional media zombies (they shamble and they eat brains), but she put a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of work into making the epidemiology plausible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning a pandemic zombie disaster novel in which people behaved like human beings, rather than psychotic, heavily armed doomsday preppers. My zombie plague differs from most: it's a viral encephalitis, possibly an odd strain of influenza, which leaves a percentage of its victims with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotard_delusion&quot;&gt;Cotard's Delusion&lt;/a&gt;, also known as walking corpse syndrome. The affected person holds a delusional belief that they're dead, or putrefying, or don't exist, or they're in hell. (It's associated with parietal lobe lesions and can also be induced by some drug metabolites: as a consequence of viral encephalitis it would be weird, but possibly no weirder than &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica&quot;&gt;Encephalitis lethargica&lt;/a&gt;.) How does a society deal with a pandemic that leaves 1% of the population permanently convinced that they're dead? Well ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a plot all worked out. TLDR: deep brain stimulation via implant. Rapidly leading to rental plans—because in our grim meathook privatised-medicine future the medical devices company who are first-to-market realize that charging people a monthly plan to feel like they're alive is a good revenue stream—but this is followed by hackers cracking the DRM on the cryptocoin-funded brain implants. The device manufacturer goes bankrupt, and their intellectual property rights are bought out by a Mafia-like operation who employ stringers to go around uploading malware to the implants of zombies who've stopped paying the rent, permanently bricking them. Our protagonist is a zombie detective: the actual story opens when a murder victim walks into a police station to complain that they've been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the whole theme of this untitled novel was going to be: this is elite panic, and this is disaster capitalism, and this is what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happens during a zombie epidemic, and these things are not the same—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then COVID-19 came along and basically rendered the whole thing unneccessary because we are all getting a real world crash-course in how we deal with people suffering from a viral pandemic, and we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; generally deal with them using shotguns and baseball bats even if they're so contagious that contact might kill us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because—&lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; my life—writing plausible near-future SF in the 21st century wasn't hard enough already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me leave you with the &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;very rough, first draft, unpolished&lt;/em&gt; only existing fragment of what was intended to be &lt;em&gt;The Lambda Functionary&lt;/em&gt; before COVID-19 buried it at the crossroads with a mouthful of garlic and a stake through its heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;hr width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER 1: &lt;strong&gt;U R DED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are an ex-zombie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most days, most of the time, you can ignore this. As existential states go, being an ex-zombie is a bit like being an ex-skier or an ex-patriate: it's bland, and anodyne, an absence of dread, the mental cavity left behind by a passing toothsome nightmare. The pulse of blood in your veins and the thoughts in your head and the warmth in your loins provide a constant reassurance that you are, in fact, alive and mammalian. Except every once in a while it leaps out from behind a lamp-post and screams death in your face like you're an alcoholic noticing the gaping door to a pub by your shoulder: and suddenly you are dead once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're perambulating along the grey cobbled canyon of Hill Street that evening—it's early summer, the nights are drawing short and the tourists are flocking—when you pass a jumble of bony knees and elbows, the bowed bald dome of a skull leaning forward as if about to boak in the gutter. At first you think it's a regular jakey boy, or maybe a beggar: but there's no cup and no weatherbeaten cardboard sign, and that stomach's not held enough food to throw up for weeks now. It takes a few seconds for your stride to clatter to a reluctant stop, by which time you're about five metres past the silent, barely-breathing figure. Coldness wraps its dreicht, despair-stained phalanges around your heart and gives it a squeeze. You shudder and take a breath, remembering Ina and the boys in the happy time before the demic, and for a moment you see yourself there on the edge of the gutter, vomiting vacuum on the stony indifference of the capital's streets as the waste trucks whine past, canned voices braying &lt;em&gt;bring out your dead&lt;/em&gt;. You don't want to look round. But you've been here before, and the guilt is suffocating, so you turn and you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lad in the gutter is indeed far gone in the post-viral zombie haze of starvation. He could be anything from seventeen to forty-seven, with the gaunt concentration-camp inmate's cheekbones and sunken eye sockets. His hair's fallen out, of course, his nails are cracked and ragged—clothes a mess, a holed hoodie and jeans that are little better than rags, muddy and shredded cerements fit to be buried in. He's still breathing, and nodding slowly every few seconds—a slow davvening, the prayerful rocking of the undead. Gums drawing back from yellowing teeth, he drools slightly. Behold, the living dead. You want to run away: he makes you cringe, feeling unclean. But instead, you crouch down beside him and, steeling yourself, you lay your right arm across his shoulders. &quot;Hey,&quot; you say. The zombie doesn't reply, of course. They never do. But you can feel the jerky rise and fall of his ribs: he's hungry. He broadcasts raw starvation like an old-time radio station with kilowatts of fossil energy to waste, pumping angst out into the ionosphere. Behind him, a boutique's robot window display repeatedly enrobes an anorexic headless mannequin in an hourglass sheath of expensive fabric, then strips it off again to reveal the skeletal ribs of the dressform fabber beneath: but you know voluntarily embraced hunger lacks the killing quality of the starving undead. &quot;When did you last eat?&quot; You murmur in his ear, not expecting any response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nuuuuh ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock almost makes you let go. He vocalized: that means he's not let go. Lights on, somebody's still home—even if the light's a fading flashlight. You tap your glasses and peel your eyes. &quot;Matt here. Got a responsive shambler in Hill Street Backup, please.&quot; Then you hook one hand under his armpit and push yourself up off the floor. &quot;Hey, kid. Let's get some food in you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nuuuurr.&quot; He might be trying to say &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;, but you're not having it. You manage to get yourself up, and he's so light—skin and bones, really—that he comes with, doesn't try to put up a fight. Opposite the posh frock fab you see the frosted window and kitsch logo of a once-trendy pub. It's not your usual dive, but it's still mid-evening and the kitchen will be open, so you shoulder-barge your way through the swing-door with Dead Guy lurching drunkenly athwart behind, and bring him to the nearest empty table. &quot; Ye cannae be bringing the likes of that in here—&quot; The bartender is brassy and indignant, but you smile at her and she blinks and subsides as she kens that you're peeling tonight. &quot;Aye, wheel, if it pukes on the carpet you're paying!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there are no other customers cluttering up this end of the hostelry and liable to be discommoded by your Samaritan emergency: just a handful of sour-faced old regulars supping their IPAs by the brightwork at the bar. &quot;I'd like a portion of cheese'n'chips and a bowl of chicken nuggets,&quot; I tell her. She looks askance: &quot;soon as I get some protein in him the sooner I can get him out of here and into rehab,&quot; I add. &quot;Peeling, ken?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She nods tightly, face like a furled umbrella, and scoots for the til. The chicken nuggets aren't nuggets and have never been near a bird, but they're easily swallowed: ditto the chips'n'cheese. It's all soft, high carb/high fat sludge that used to get hammered by the sin tax during the war on obesity: now it's back on the menu as pub grub, and it's especially good for shoveling into a zombie who, after all, is dead and therefore utterly uninterested in matters gustatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boney Jim—you've got to call him something, and he's not going to give you a name—sits quietly where you parked him on the bench seat. He's still davvening. The food comes (along with the drink you ordered to still your unquiet nerves) and you pick up a greasy hot chip and push it at his lips. &quot;Eat,&quot; you tell him. For a miracle, he opens his mouth. You shove the chip in and get your fingers out of the way just in time. He chews and swallows, and you repeat the process with a nugget of deep-fried freshly printed avian myocites. Then some more chips. He is eating and swallowing what you place in front of his lips, even though his hands don't move and his eyes are a million kilometers away, staring into infinity, pupils fixed and dilated. Boney Jim, Zombie Jim. If you'd left him out there he'd probably have lasted a couple more days before starvation, thirst, or exposure got him. It's going to be necessary to track down whoever dumped him in the street like that: you add it to the to-do spike in your glasses. Eyes Peeled, as they say. You went through this yourself, in an earlier life. There's light at the other end of the tunnel, and it isn't necessarily the white light of eternity if somebody cares enough to get you to a clinic and rehab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ina cared enough to do it for you: but you weren't there to do it for her when the time came, and sometimes the shame and the guilt is worse than the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been feeding your zombie for about a quarter of an hour when you realize that you're not alone any more. The Principles have sent you aid and comfort in the shape of a couple of Kindness Volunteers who—like yourself—are peeling tonight. She's a rosy-cheeked middle-aged woman in a tweed twin-set and cultured pearls, sensible shoes her only concession: he looks like a painfully earnest Baptist Sunday school teacher from the 1960s, stranded most of a century in his own future—a determinedly retro hipster look. Maybe they're twentieth century cosplayers who've escaped from the convention center for an evening of determined volunteerism. Or maybe they're the real thing. Either way you're grateful. &quot;I found him outside,&quot; you explain, pushing another not-chicken not-nugget at Boney Jim's mandible. &quot;Just sitting on the pavement. I think he's stage IVa, maybe IVb, but there's still some reactivity. Might be something they can work with at Greyfriars.&quot; They set up a receiving unit for zombies in the former graveyard, at the height of the demic. White dome tents mushrooming among the lichen-encrusted headstones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;hr width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

<title>Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax and other developers won’t</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;rs0ccs&quot;&gt;Apple and Amazon very, very quietly unveiled a monumental app deal this week, without fanfare or, sadly, much in the way of transparency. Out of nowhere, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change&quot;&gt;buttons to buy or rent movies appeared in the Amazon Prime Video app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s difficult to express how strange this is: for over a decade, Apple has stuck to the rule that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; digital goods sold in iOS apps &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use Apple’s payment methods, including Apple’s 30 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7LB6XJ&quot;&gt;Suddenly, that rule appears to apply to all developers except those who have the leverage to cut a special deal with Apple. That’s the most damning way of putting it and the truth is perhaps a bit more nuanced. But if you wanted to cast that nuance aside and rail against metaphorical smoke-filled rooms where giant companies cut deals that aren’t offered to anybody else, well, I wouldn’t argue with you too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;JFqE55&quot;&gt;I want to get into some of the details here — much of which is based more on reasonable assumption than confirmed information (see the note about transparency above). I think it’s interesting in its own right, but I also think it’s important context for the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; question: what does this mean for everybody else in the App Store ecosystem? (I’ll disclose here that my wife works for Oculus on its app store, but I recuse myself from reporting on it so I have literally no idea what Oculus’ policies are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eoEHed&quot;&gt;Apple provided us with a statement about the change. You may have read it already, but there’s enough detail in the wording to give us a fuller picture of what’s really going on. (An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the change and some of the features without giving a formal comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7IVdKX&quot;&gt;Here’s Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PQUEb1&quot;&gt;Apple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits — including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on. On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Altice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hvx5za&quot;&gt;There is quite a lot to unpack here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LGYT2X&quot;&gt;Firstly, I just want to point out that Apple calls this an “established program,” one that already applied to those smaller cable companies. But it was completely new news to me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1245470774409842688&quot;&gt;also to longtime Apple reporter Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, who definitely would have remembered such a thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;yyW70O&quot; readability=&quot;6.6176470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;6.6176470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To be clear, Apple says this an an established program. Amazon Prime is new today and most significant partner. I have never heard of this program until today and we all know I’d know about it&lt;/p&gt;
— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1245470774409842688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pLQxvx&quot;&gt;Anyway, you can suss out the outlines of the deal that was struck. Amazon gets buy buttons inside its app for current Prime Video subscribers, Apple gets Amazon’s complete and total participation in the Apple TV features it cares about the most. Instead of just being yet another icon in the home screen grid, Amazon’s services are now deeply integrated into the user experiences Apple wants to move everybody towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;smm6zz&quot;&gt;Nilay Patel made this point quite strongly in today’s Vergecast podcast — give it a listen. Apple has long wanted to make the TV app the primary interface on the Apple TV box, but it needs more services to integrate into that UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x98Ld4&quot;&gt;Apple also very much wants to get consumers to sign up for other channels like HBO or Cinemax through its Apple TV app. And that’s where the second Amazon concession comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ClZiZr&quot;&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;, John Gruber did the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/amazon_apple_prime_video&quot;&gt;punching the subscribe and pay buttons on all the possible permutations&lt;/a&gt; of subscribing to Amazon Prime Video in and out of Apple’s TV app. What he discovered is something that isn’t mentioned in Apple’s statement: if you’re not already a Prime Video subscriber, the sign-up flow in Amazon’s app ends up getting routed through Apple’s payment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;73OcyT&quot;&gt;There are some hidden caveat words at the very end of the statement. I’ll just emphasize them here: “customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their &lt;strong&gt;existing video subscription&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GQEUHy&quot;&gt;Which means that Apple is getting a cut of the new subscriptions that start in Amazon’s app. Perhaps it’s the standard 30 percent in the first year, 15 percent after that. Perhaps it’s something better. Bottom line, new customers have their payments routed through Apple, existing Prime customers don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;05VlHJ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has clear incentives to cut a deal with Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Lwo8tA&quot;&gt;All of the above is why I’m comfortable saying that Amazon had leverage on Apple: Apple has clear incentives in the form of getting more participation in the Apple TV app and in getting a cut on the new subscribers it drives to Amazon. Amazon has the incentive of not paying more money to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wK40Iv&quot;&gt;Most of all, you can tell it’s about leverage simply because the Amazon Kindle app hasn’t changed. You can’t buy a Kindle book directly in the Kindle app, nor is Amazon even allowed to link to or even hint at the possibility that it has a whole damn Kindle store on its website where you can make one-click purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wPO1un&quot;&gt;Last but certainly not least, let us turn our attention to my favorite part of Apple’s statement, the one that defines what kind of companies are apparently able to get this sweetheart deal: “premium subscription video entertainment providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VRZRJU&quot;&gt;Last time I checked, Netflix is a “premium subscription video entertainment provider.” Also, last time I checked it had zero interest in giving up its own UI just to have its shows mixed in with everybody else’s in the Apple TV app. Actually, I haven’t technically checked — but Nick Statt is doing so with Netflix and a whole host of other companies as I write these words. Keep an eye out for his report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;noIZkX&quot;&gt;Take that phrase and add the word “games” to it and you’re pretty much describing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has been incredibly outspoken about App Store taxes. He’s taken &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the Google Play Store and would dearly love to find a way to not have to give Apple a cut on iOS devices. Does he have a personal stake in that fight? Obviously. But he’s also one of a growing chorus of voices pushing back against the so-called “Apple Tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lRoAQH&quot;&gt;When the Amazon news hit, the very first thing I wrote in our Slack was “Tim Sweeney is going to lose his shit.” Sweeney did not, but he did &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1245511126454087680&quot;&gt;post a “congratulations” tweet so thick with schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; you could wedge a Fortnite pickaxe into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;S9OWkJ&quot; readability=&quot;6.5753424657534&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.013698630137&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Congratulations to Apple on their move towards opening up the iOS App Store to payment competition, and congratulations to Amazon for launching the first app to support developer-provided billing for digital goods on iOS!&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/oMt83H2q4c&quot;&gt;https://t.co/oMt83H2q4c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1245511126454087680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uqKyLr&quot;&gt;Epic is not the only company pushing back against Apple’s App Store fees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair&quot;&gt;Spotify has filed a formal antitrust complaint in the European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s pushback is that fewer than 0.5 percent of Spotify users are charged Apple’s 15-percent fee, but that argument &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715719/apple-spotify-eu-antitrust-complaint-response&quot;&gt;disingenuously leaves out the fact that Spotify hasn’t offered a direct way to subscribe in its iOS app since 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1iYEqH&quot;&gt;I recently rewatched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?462660-1/online-platforms-entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;House Judiciary’s July 2019 hearing on “Online platforms and entrepreneurship” on C-Span&lt;/a&gt; (how I choose to spend my self-isolation is my business). In it, Apple’s corporate law &amp;amp; chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer repeated the claim about Spotify. He also pointed out that 84 percent of apps in the App Store pay nothing to Apple because they’re free and that a decade ago, app developers were paying quite a bit more than 30% to retail stores for the physical distribution of their goods. (The relevant question from Rep Jamie Raskin starts about 90 minutes in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;nj1Avu&quot;&gt;All of these arguments are old hat. And though the Netflixes, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;s, and Spotifys of the world are surely vexed by Apple’s policies, I think that for many smaller developers the 30-percent fee is simply not at the top of their list of concerns. Higher priorities likely include prices being driven down, market dynamics being corrupted by free-to-play games, upgrades made difficult because of limited pricing models, review-bombing over subscription fees, and just making payroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4t17tK&quot;&gt;If there’s a moral and rhetorical force behind my opening line about smoke-filled rooms, it’s this: developing mobile apps is hard and succeeding is even harder, but at least you could tell yourself that even gigantic companies like Amazon have to deal with the same rules you do. The question is whether Apple needs to be held to a standard of fairness and transparency for the app ecosystem it fully controls on iOS or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2Ni8PV&quot;&gt;Because Apple has such strict control over what apps can appear on iOS, it bears a higher burden of responsibility to treat iOS developers fairly and consistently. Note I didn’t say “equally,” because it’s unrealistic to expect that a first-time dev could get the same accommodations as massive companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4mFQdE&quot;&gt;But if the rule is you pay Apple a 30-percent cut of your app’s cost unless Apple really needs something from you to bolster its own subscription business, that’s neither fair nor consistent. I asked Apple if there was something other developers could do to qualify for a deal that’s similar to what Amazon now has. The company referred me to its original statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;WQ83NL&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;CF1vGa&quot;&gt;Intel and Nvidia’s new lineup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1199127227&quot;&gt;Big news in laptop land: Intel and Nvidia dropped their new stuff on the world. I’m particularly interested to see how Intel’s 10th Gen chips stack up against AMD. Sadly, “10th Gen” isn’t a very descriptive term these days, what with the 10nm vs 14nm models and other complications in the roadmap. The chips we’re looking at today are for gaming laptops, mainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;986UNM&quot;&gt;And so, there are also a handful of new gaming laptops. My favorite, in case you’re wondering, is Asus’. It’s not only a member of the Keyboard In The Front Club, I think it is now the &lt;em&gt;president.&lt;/em&gt; It was voted into office by unanimous consent after showing that its bottom screen flips up. It’s ridiculous and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1199124632&quot;&gt;Amazon’s inchoate pandemic responses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PiklVN&quot;&gt;A little more than a week ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/24/21191036/amazon-prime-service-disruptions-coronavirus-covid-19&quot;&gt;Casey Newton called for a daily coronavirus briefing from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I agreed then and agree even more now, if only because it would be a forcing function for senior executives to present a coherent response strategy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PglfAG&quot;&gt;More than many companies, Amazon can make the case that it’s an essential businesses. And yet for all of the thinking, effort, robotics, and software that has gone into its warehouse logistics, precious little of that disciplined, organized approach is apparent in its efforts to protect the workers in those warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mulP05&quot;&gt;Yesterday, it belatedly did the right thing by pledging to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204254/amazon-warehouse-walkout-coronavirus-protections-masks-temperature&quot;&gt;temperature checks and masks in all warehouses&lt;/a&gt;. I also applaud the decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204625/amazon-sales-ban-n95-public-surgical-hospitals-governments&quot;&gt;stop selling N95 and surgical masks to the public&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205834/amazon-prime-video-sxsw-2020-films-virtual-film-festival&quot;&gt;virtual SXSW film festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;o4JGsc&quot;&gt;But at the same time, Amazon’s general counsel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206108/amazon-chris-smalls-warehouse-strike-nyc-jay-carney-bernie-sanders-coronavirus-safety&quot;&gt;privately insulted a warehouse worker&lt;/a&gt; that had been fired. Amazon contends he had broken social distancing rules, but that doesn’t excuse the memo in the slightest. And then, as is his wont, Amazon SVP Jay Carney popped off on Twitter with the following, easily one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JayCarney/status/1245552664244621312&quot;&gt;top five self-owns in the history of corporate PR:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;5.673640167364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I wonder if folks on Twitter who respond to facts and ideas they don’t like with ad hominem vitriol ever pause to wonder why they’re not very good at winning people over to their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
— Jay Carney (@JayCarney) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JayCarney/status/1245552664244621312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bbCw8Z&quot;&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1199122265&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, though this next story isn’t technically, it’s certainly related. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21198272/blue-origin-coronavirus-leaked-audio-test-launch-workers-jeff-bezos&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company is pressuring employees to launch a tourist rocket during the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Loren Grush has the inside story on what’s going on at Blue Origin and their attitude to the pandemic seems really shortsighted to me. Which is ironic, given the company’s long-term vision of securing the future of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QoW6rq&quot;&gt;In a meeting with the New Shepard team on Wednesday, April 1st, Blue Origin leadership talked about ways to do a trip to Van Horn with a smaller group than usual and suggested that employees should keep a low profile while in town, according to a recording provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In the meeting, numerous employees voiced concerns about the trip, and one manager said there may be employment repercussions if they didn’t agree with management’s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kIax4C&quot;&gt;“I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?” Jeff Ashby, a senior mission assurance director at Blue Origin and a former NASA astronaut, said to employees during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

Justine Calma looks at one of those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WmVgFp&quot;&gt;Like pretty much everything else right now, reusable bags should probably be handled more carefully to minimize the risk of transmitting disease to other people. At the same time, there has been no evidence so far that using reusable grocery bags have been responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GOV.UK Notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;lets central government, local authorities and the NHS send emails, text messages and letters to their users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We usually send between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/performance/govuk-notify/notifications-by-type&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;100,000 and 200,000 text messages a day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s important for services using Notify that they’re able to quickly and successfully send text messages to their users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those services rely on us to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/18/gov-uk-notify-is-available-for-the-public-sector-to-use-for-emergency-staff-communications/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;send important messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for example a flood warning or a two-factor authentication (2FA) code so their users can sign in to another service. We design and build Notify with this in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using multiple text message providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a central government, local authority or NHS service wants to send a text message to a user, they ask Notify, either manually through our web interface or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;using our API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, to send it. We then send an HTTP request to a text message provider to ask them to deliver the message. No provider will be working perfectly 100% of the time (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nor should we expect them to be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Because of this we have 2 different providers, so if one encounters any issues we can use the other provider to send the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our original load balancing design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Originally we sent all text messages through one provider, say provider A. If provider A started having trouble, Notify would automatically swap all traffic to provider B – a process known as a failover. We used 2 measures to decide if a provider was having problems and failover. We measured a:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;single 500-599 HTTP response code from the provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;slowdown in successful delivery callbacks (a message back from the provider to say it had delivered the message to the recipient)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine if callbacks were slow, we’d measure the last 10 minutes of messages being sent. We’d consider callbacks slow if 30% of them took longer than 4 minutes to report back as delivered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We could also manually swap traffic from, say, provider A to provider B as we wanted. We did this often, maybe once a week, to try and reach a roughly 50/50 split of messages sent between each of our providers. If we ended up sending only a small number of messages through one provider over the long run, they might not be massively incentivised to be a provider in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A problem with our original design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day, towards the end of 2019, we had a large spike in requests to send text messages. We sent all these requests to one of our providers but it turned out they couldn’t handle the load and started to fail. Our system swapped to the other provider but it turned out that sending a large amount of traffic out of nowhere caused them to start returning errors too. It was likely that our providers needed time to scale up to handle the sudden load we were sending them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we improved our resiliency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We changed Notify to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-api/pull/2660&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;send traffic to both providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with a roughly 50/50 split. When a single text message is sent, Notify will pick a provider at random. This should reduce the chance of giving our providers a very large amount of unexpected traffic that they will not be able to handle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also changed how we handled errors from our providers. If a provider gives us a 500-599 HTTP response code, we would reduce their share of the load by 10 percentage points (and therefore increase the other provider by 10 percentage points). We will not reduce the share if it’s already been reduced in the last minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also decided that if a provider is slow to deliver messages, measured in the same way as before, we would reduce their share of the load by 10 percentage points. Again, we will not reduce the share if it’s already been reduced in the last minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s important that we wait a minute before allowing another 500-599 HTTP response code to decrease that provider’s share of traffic again. This means that just a small blip, for example five 500-599 HTTP responses over a second, doesn’t switch all traffic to the other provider too quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equally balancing our traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We still had the manual task of equally balancing our traffic if we no longer needed to push that traffic towards one of the providers. We decided that, if neither provider had changed its balance of traffic in the last hour, we’d move both providers 10 percentage points closer to their defined resting points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means our system will automatically restore itself to the middle and removes the manual burden of our team trying to send roughly equal traffic to both providers. We can still manually decide what percentage of traffic goes to each provider if we want to, but this is something we anticipate doing rarely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We did consider trying to overcorrect traffic to bring the overall balance back to 50/50 over, say, a month. For example, if provider A has an incident and receives no traffic for 24 hours, we could give it 70% of the traffic for the next few days to overcorrect the traffic it lost. We decided doing this would only bring a small benefit and would increase the complexity of our load balancing system. Keeping things as simple as possible won the argument in this case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the service is doing now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The following graphs show the number of text messages we sent to each of our providers per second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the morning of 26 January one of our providers ran into problems and we reduced their share of traffic down to zero. Every hour for a while after this you can see us give them 10% of traffic to see if they have recovered enough, but they hadn’t so it got reduced back to 0% again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33520 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-620x313.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph of how many notifications we are sending per second during the problematic situation&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-620x313.png 620w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-310x156.png 310w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-768x388.png 768w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-1536x775.png 1536w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2-435x220.png 435w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image2.png 1999w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally the next afternoon their system improved and we moved back towards a roughly equal split of traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33521 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-620x315.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph of how many notifications we are sending per second after the problematic situation was resolved&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-620x315.png 620w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-310x158.png 310w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-768x390.png 768w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-1536x781.png 1536w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3-435x221.png 435w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2020/04/image3.png 1999w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This fix works for us now. As we continue to grow we'll do more stuff like this to make sure we're providing the best performance, resilience and value for money to Notify’s users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: What do you use to keep track of bookmarks/notes/snippets?</title>

<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;I’m curious as to the tools or techniques people use to keep track of things like bookmarks, snippets of code or text, etc.?
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used a variety of tools (simple browser bookmarks, Pinboard, Evernote, a text file, etc) but have never been very happy with any of the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have great tools or methods of storing bits of info for later access?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking something that at a minimum has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Tagging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Support for different content types (links, text, video embeds, photos, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Also would be nice to have mobile app, browser extension, API, Zappier integration, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Hello HN!
&lt;p&gt;As part of my learning in data science, I need/want to gather data. One relatively easy way to do that is web scraping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I'd like to do that in a respectful way. Here are three things I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Identify my bot with a user agent/info URL, and provide a way to contact me 2. Don't DoS websites with tons of request. 3. Respect the robots.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else would be considered good practice when it comes to web scraping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;

<title>What Armenians should know about life in America (2014)</title>
<link>https://likewise.am/2014/12/26/what-armenians-should-know-about-life-in-america/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://likewise.am/2014/12/26/what-armenians-should-know-about-life-in-america/</guid>
<description>&lt;small class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted:&lt;/strong&gt; December 26, 2014&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;author-link&quot;&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://likewise.am/author/abalashov/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by abalashov&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;abalashov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meta-sep&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cat-links&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filed under:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://likewise.am/category/armenia/&quot; rel=&quot;category tag&quot;&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meta-sep&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most Armenian immigrants to the US, it is quite likely that American life offers a higher material standard of living and more access to vastly greater opportunities. If that weren’t broadly true, people wouldn’t emigrate there. It is no less true that the relative poverty and ongoing demographic implosion of Armenia can be crushing, and that daily life there for a great many people is closer to the problems of basic survival than the life of most Americans. That’s fairly self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, from the year and a half that I’ve spent in Armenia, if I had a 10 &lt;em&gt;dram&lt;/em&gt; coin for every time I’ve heard from native Armenians that America is the promised land of high dollars and low worries, or that I’ve heard righteously indignant gripes about stingy relatives in the US who “only” send a few hundred dollars in monthly remittance, or “you’re American, what’s a hundred dollars to you?”, or (my favourite) “isn’t everything cheaper in America?”, I’d be a billionaire (in dollars). I could get my own &lt;em&gt;faux &lt;/em&gt;Sphinx, or Egyptian pyramid, or something on a highway on the outskirts of Yerevan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first-generation immigrant to the US, and an experienced traveler to the so-called “developing world”, I’d like to address some of the myths held by Armenians, be it that life in the US is convenient and comfortable, or that their US-side relatives, with the pocket change they send back to &lt;em&gt;tatik&lt;/em&gt;, have crossed to the dark side of unconscienable avarice and forgotten the meaning of family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not passing judgement on whether anyone should emigrate. However, if you’re going to try to emigrate, it’s better to do it with some realism about what to expect, and some appreciation for the complexity encountered in trying to make meaningful comparisons between life there and life back home. Like many people, Armenians have a tendency to compare the worst aspects of life in Armenia with the best aspects of life in America, or elsewhere abroad. Yes, being young, healthy and rich in America is better than being poor, sick and aging in Armenia, no doubt. But it’s not an accurate or reasonable comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, this is not some myopic apologia full of First World Problems, to tell native Armenians how hard life is for us in one of the world’s richest countries. I’m not here to share the horror of a broken espresso machine or Banana Republic being out of khakis (with apologies to George Carlin). You can put the world’s tiniest violin away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has always done an excellent job of marketing itself as the promised land, and the global reach of its mass-cultural and media exports to support that narrative is unrivaled. So, I don’t really need to tell you what is potentially good about it. Instead, I’ll speak to the more ambiguous notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs and immigration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not earning well in Armenia because you don’t have any specialised skills or education, you’re going to face the same problem anywhere else; wages for unskilled labour are low everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hundreds of thousands of Armenian migrant workers in Russia know, a blue-collar labourers can still fetch superior (relative to Armenia) wages during boom times, particularly in construction and industrial labour. However, this is not a realistic vehicle for emigration to the US for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The criteria for immigration: the US has plenty of unskilled manual labourers, both domestic and immigrant (legal and illegal). It has absolutely no incentive to let any more of them in, and US employers can’t sponsor a pair of hands and a strong back for a visa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sheer expense of life in the US, where a great deal of costs, such as healthcare, are borne directly by the consumer. Some of these are covered at least rudimentarily by state infrastructure or held down by free-market pricing elsewhere. In other words, I would contend that earning little in the US by US standards can be riskier and more problematic than earning little by Russian or Armenian standards in Russia or Armenia. We’ll return to that topic later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a (somewhat) common market with Armenia and is politically motivated to offer an inclusive attitude to CIS guest workers. This is not so for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Armenians I’ve met seem to be under the impression that if they just had an &lt;em&gt;axperes&lt;/em&gt; in California that could hook them up with a job at his auto shop, the visa and immigration issues will solve themselves. This is completely false. While knowing people and having connections is useful anywhere, overall the US economy, along with its immigration system, are fairly transparent and follow the law strictly. Moreover, it is important to remember that the US is very large, very diverse, and not run by Armenians–who represent a tiny and insignificant minority. Nobody there can just “arrange” it all for you unless you meet official immigration criteria. It doesn’t work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a highly skilled, educated professional, presumably you have or will attempt to solve this problem in advance of emigrating, and you might be successful. Even so, there are a few things to keep in mind. Armenians specialise highly in urbane intellectualism and their diaspora has a high proportion of academics. This should not be confused with a high availability of academic jobs, especially in the liberal arts and humanities. Funding for that sort of thing is quite slim by developed-world standards. While professors are generally compensated well in the US, the number of available tenure-track positions, or even full-time instructorships, is small and shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost-saving approach of American universities is not so much to pay professors little as it is to eliminate their positions and replace them with part-time graduate teaching assistants and part-time instructors–expendable armies of people who are paid measly wages (effectively below minimum wage) &lt;em&gt;a la carte &lt;/em&gt;(by the course), with no job security or benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition, and the harsh office politics that come with it, is formidable, because even in this sweatshop atmosphere, graduate students need teaching hours. Your formal credentials may not carry over to the American system, which means you’ll be disadvantaged in competing with 26-year old second-year graduate students for the opportunity to provide essentially free labour to this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the large public university that I attended, easily 80% of my courses were taught by graduate students not much older than I was. Needless to say, teaching quality is not a major preoccupation of the American university system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all to say that I wouldn’t count on an academic route in. It’s not impossible; in fact, it’s the one my parents took. But they had to step down from top-tier Moscow professorships to repeat graduate school for six years, then beat very low job market and employer sponsorship odds to stay. I wouldn’t have bet on us. We just got lucky. A lot of it probably owes itself to the unique boom times of the nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectively speaking, the people in the best position to emigrate to the US, with employer sponsorship, are probably highly-skilled professionals in the private sector. Even so, the quotas on H1B visas are highly restrictive. In the tech sector, at least, there is widespread agreement that the part of the US immigration system that deals with &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; immigration of high-skill professionals is in badly in need of reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The costs of life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly obvious that the absolute cost of living in the US, and in Western countries in general, is higher than in Armenia. Native Armenians recognise this in abstract, but many seem to lack the perspective to apply that knowledge concretely to any given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say an Armenian family of three or four gets by in Yerevan, somehow, on roughly US$900/mo. They hear that their cousin and his wife in Fresno pull in a household income of US$95,000 (roughly US$7900/mo). So, they figure, “How much more expensive could it be? Twice? Three times? How stingy do you have to be to only send back $300 every month while we’re working twelve hours a day, six days per week, to make ends meet with $900?” It seems to be human nature to figure: “If I had that kind of money, I’d find a way. How expensive could it be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because, at some level, most people think that if they can get by on $900, then anything over that–or at least half of anything over that–is, in some shape or form, “extra” or “disposable”, even taking into account the theoretical recognition of higher living costs. The higher costs don’t concretely register, mostly because people don’t know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost of living differential is a fluid concept that presents in many different forms. First, there are the exact same or substantially similar things, but which simply cost more in, say, Fresno–maybe a little more, maybe a lot more. Then, there are the things that are of the same category but are qualitatively incommensurable in some way, so it’s difficult to meaningfully compare their price. There are also things that are free or close to free in Armenia but cost money in the States. As well, there are substantial differences in anticipated risk and statistical incidence of certain expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, one cannot simply compare prices straight across. It is important to holistically understand the overall differences in the available lifestyle options, as well as the categories of expenditures that are structurally, legally or culturally particular to the respective locales. In many cases, they are very specific to the exact socioeconomic terms of a given place. In other words, you’re not going to buy the same things in the US that you do in Yerevan; they’ll neither be the same products or services, nor identical categories of outlays. It’s not intelligible to conceptualise a monthly budget in Fresno in everyday Yerevan terms, though that doesn’t stop many people from doing exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know who seeded this meme that Americans pay low taxes. I’ve heard it repeated a number of times in casual conversations with Armenians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average American salary and wage employees pay a tax rate that is typical of the developed world, and is fairly comparable, in the aggregate, to the 35-45% that most Western Europeans pay, though, of course, that varies by country. A rigourous comparative analysis of international taxation could easily consume a whole dissertation in itself, and I don’t have data handy. In some respects, US taxes are indeed lower than European ones: &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; tax rates are unquestionably much lower. On the other hand, marginal US corporate income tax rates are some of the highest in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference is that the US is, by “First World” standards, very jurisdictionally fragmented, owing to its unique fixation with federalism. The aggregate individual tax burden in the US doesn’t come from one national-level tax authority. There are several different kinds of federal taxes, all assessed at different rates, limits and progressive brackets. There are state-level income taxes. Some &lt;em&gt;counties&lt;/em&gt; (administrative divisions of states) have special income taxes. Some cities, such as New York City, have municipal income taxes. In addition to that, there are sales taxes (varying by county and state), property taxes (a very substantial source of local government funding), excise taxes, and gasoline taxes, and for business owners and self-employed individuals, a variety of other kinds of taxes. Most of these are assessed in a complex cascade by a zoo of separate agencies at the state, federal and municipal level, all with their own rules, forms, courts, collection practices, and so on. It’s all quite Byzantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fragmentation makes it difficult to add up one’s aggregate tax burden, but if one does, one will find that it’s not substantially out of line with Western Europe. The difference is that the Western European taxpayer receives an abundance of social benefits and subsidies for it. In the US, there is no free healthcare, free university education, or free housing. From that point of view, the US is one of the most expensive jurisdictions in the “First World”; you have to pay both sides!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s virtually impossible to compute exactly how much our hypothetical Fresno family earning $95,000 will pay in taxes, because nobody pays the same amount in taxes. It greatly depends on whether they file jointly or separately, whether they have children, and if so, how many, and many other factors. California state income tax is deductible from the federal taxable income, and so on, but not from the 7.5% that they contribute toward federal payroll taxes (Medicare &amp;amp; Social Security). Without running all those numbers, together with the particulars of their withholding allowances, it’s not easy to arrive at a figure. Nevertheless, a very rough estimation for a single individual making $95,000 and filing as single in California puts total tax at around $33,000, or roughly 35%. This, of course, is just state and federal taxes, and does not include local sales tax (which, in California, varies from 7.5% to 10%), nor any possible property taxes, vehicle registration taxes, and a variety of other taxes that, when added up, will certainly push the tax burden past 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with our 35% figure, you can expect take-home income off $95,000 to drop to $62,000 or so, which is not so much $7900/mo as $5100/mo. Not a small difference! It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility for one to pay close to half one’s income in taxes. For a variety of reasons related to the intricacies of tax codes at a variety of levels, most Americans don’t end up paying quite that much, but a lot of the professional middle class comes close. The point is: don’t jump to conclusions from sensational, eye-popping gross figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing, real estate and rents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the US Census Bureau, 2013 Median Gross Rent in 2013 was US $905. That may not seem like so much, but that’s a median across the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the US is a very large and decentralised country, and there are plenty of inexpensive rural areas, as well as blighted post-industrial places, where housing is cheap. That doesn’t mean you want to live there. The jobs are fewer and the incomes are lower, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I think a little Googling will persuade one that housing in the kinds of places where most Armenians would want to live and seem to agglomerate, e.g. southern California, is a matter of at least $1200/mo, and very possibly closer to $2000/mo or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armenians, like other ex-Soviet people, are in a globally unique position of benefiting from the privatisation of real estate after the collapse of the USSR. Simply, if you had an apartment at the time the USSR dissolved, you got to keep it; it was gifted to you as private property. It became a source of wealth on which many people rely. It is common for Armenians to own the home in which they live, even if they are likely to be living there with extended family. The fact that most of them don’t have a mortgage or rent to pay explains how they can get by on such low wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, if you have an apartment in Yerevan, you’ve got a roof. It may not be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; roof, but it’s a roof. You can rent it out to other people, as many do to supplement their monthly income. It may not be much, but it’s something. Other Soviet people benefited from privatisation much more; people fortunate enough to own Moscow apartments genuinely came to sit on some wealth, both from rental and liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armenians are sometimes under the impression that lots of Americans own houses, too. This is a misapprehension; Very few Americans own homes free and clear. Lots of Americans have purchased &lt;em&gt;financed&lt;/em&gt; houses, usually on 15 or 30-year mortgage loan terms. While the interest rates are low by present-day Armenian standards, the post-recessionary credit environment has contracted and it has become harder to get a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that almost all Americans pay rent or a mortgage in order to have a roof. It’s usually their biggest expense, and frequently a large proportion of their income. The processes of civil law operate quite expediently; if you don’t pay, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be evicted, or your home will be repossessed by the bank and auctioned off. This is something that many Armenians are unaccustomed to considering, since a good many of them live in apartments inherited through post-Soviet privatisation and/or through family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit and debt is a way of life in America, especially for big-ticket items. Few homes or cars are bought in cash. That may seem like a good thing–it makes things more affordable and at more realistic rates than in Armenia. However, as with any leverage, prices rose to reflect the widespread availability of credit (a consequence that monetary stimulus policy relies upon), which means most people need credit to buy things that they could not &lt;em&gt;conceivably&lt;/em&gt; afford in cash. For quite some time now, credit has not been merely a tool to make it easier to afford some things, but rather the only means of obtaining them at all for average-earning people. That means that unless you become wealthy by &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt; standards, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to buy a house, and if you do, you’ll be in enormous debt for what is, by most people’s standards, a close-enough approximation of forever. You can sell a house to get out of that obligation, but clearing what you owe the bank is your problem and your risk. The recent housing recession should serve to remind that housing is not such a dependable store of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many would say that against the background of the state of the Armenian economy, it is an enviable luxury to even be in a position to contemplate optimal stores of wealth or weigh the downsides of credit, as a member of a sizable middle class. I don’t disagree. The point of this article is not to convince you that, from a material point of view, life in the US is as bad or worse than life in Armenia. Instead, I want to put emphasis on things that are typically underemphasised by starry-eyed aspiring emigrants who imagine life abroad to be a panacea. Life in wealthier countries brings problems and stresses of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Armenians’ chief complaints is the high cost of healthcare relative to local incomes, and understandably so–it’s high. Nevertheless, Armenia has a largely free market in healthcare; payments are direct from patient to medical provider, and so prices are constrained by what the market will directly bear. Healthcare is a price-inelastic service, and so the prices the market will bear–grudgingly–are quite high. Nevertheless, there is a quantitative limit to the madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any immigrant to the US can be fully prepared for the disaster that is the healthcare system. Simply put, it has neither the virtues of prices held down by supply and demand, nor the virtues of a state-operated or single-payer socialised healthcare model that predominates in Western Europe and elsewhere in the developed world. Instead, the US has managed to achieve the worst of all worlds: all downsides, no upside. Astounding inflation in the market is caused by the distortions of an intermediate bureaucracy of private insurers, rendering it &lt;em&gt;ipso facto &lt;/em&gt;unaffordable without insurance. At the same time, the system is highly inefficient, having the highest proportion of medical expenditures going to nonmedical purposes (e.g. administration, marketing, legal costs) in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most nontrivial medical procedures and hospitalisations cost tens of thousands of dollars. A serious illness will incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical billing, and very serious illnesses likely well into the millions. If you’re fortunate enough to have a health insurance policy through your employer, which is the normal mechanism for obtaining health insurance in the US, these fees are billed to your insurer, who will do anything they can to get out of paying the claim. The Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) reforms have seemingly put an end to the most audaciously hostile aspects of this (huge departments in every insurance company dedicated to finding “preexisting conditions” on the basis of which to reject your claim, leaving you responsible for the fees), but it remains to be seen whether these reforms will survive future legal challenges by conservative (i.e. pro-big business) political forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of other caveats that can lead to your insurance claim being rejected remain, the main one at this point being that insurers typically will cover what they consider to be medically necessary, which is often the bare minimum of indicated treatment. Anything beyond that is “elective” (a.k.a. superfluous and unnecessary) and they are not obligated to cover it. It’s true that any system with cost controls imposed by a third party, such as state-operated socialised healthcare systems in Europe, must limit what medical providers will do for a patient in a given scenario. However, I think you’ll find that in the US, the resulting mixture is especially perverse; very often, unnecessary procedures and tests (which pad doctors’ pockets) are easily approved, while procedures that would be deemed medically essential elsewhere are treated as elective and denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you have insurance, you will share in these inflated costs. The sharing doesn’t end with high premiums (which have gotten significantly higher since the ACA came about), but also a maze of other mechanisms insurers use to defray some of their financial risk directly onto you (but on the cost basis of the severe inflation they themselves helped create): deductibles, copays and coinsurance ratios, which vary considerably with type of medical service or procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply having insurance by itself means little; it all depends on what kind of insurance. The vast majority of Americans do have private health insurance of some sort, yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/2014/03/26/medical-bankruptcy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;60% is a well-accepted figure for the percentage of personal bankruptcies attributable to medical bills.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;60% is a well-accepted figure for the percentage of personal bankruptcies attributable to medical bills.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/2014/03/26/medical-bankruptcy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the myriad of pathologies of the American healthcare system would take a lengthy book. Once upon a time, insurance was–as most insurance is in any other sphere–for low-probability, high-magnitude catastrophic events only. Over time, it seems to have evolved into a payment gateway for all medical procedures, period, including the most routine care. Along with a panoply of other factors, such as the absence of heavyhanded government price controls or regulation of the business side of healthcare, this enabled enormous inflation, since insurance spreads the cost around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic aspect important for the potential immigrant to realise is that the only people in the US that have access to good healthcare they can afford are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Affluent white-collar professionals working for large private companies that provide generous nonsalary benefits;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees in the government sector (state or federal);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those fortunate enough to work in unionised professions (far less common in the US than in many other developed countries, and varies highly by region) who happen to have negotiated good benefits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People over 65 years of age, who receive Medicare (ironically, very functional socialised healthcare);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very low-income people who meet stringent criteria for Medicaid;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Military veterans;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous wealthy or semi-wealthy individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the American public does not fit into these categories, and this includes many people you would be moved to otherwise describe as middle class. Statistically speaking, medical bills will probably be a problem for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that the comparatively “inexpensive” medicine in Armenia is equally unaffordable to a population whose median monthly wage is just under US$300. Nevertheless, I would contend that there’s something to be said for owing hundreds or thousands of dollars rather than a quarter million–a very real concern in a place where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/health/think-the-er-was-expensive-look-at-the-ambulance-bill.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a short ambulance ride can cost nearly US $2000.&lt;/a&gt; American healthcare bills are not in sums you can somehow borrow from family or friends. I suspect one reason why the TV series &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; had such uptake is that it resonated with a lot of people. It’s not &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a stretch for most Americans to imagine that running a methamphetamine drug empire would be the only way for an ordinary schoolteacher to afford treatment of his lung cancer and ensure his family’s financial security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suburbia, layout, and transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US economy is highly decentralised and has an excellent roadway network for distribution. Outside of a few older cities such as New York, it is mostly laid out in a monotonous, low-density, &lt;em&gt;suburban&lt;/em&gt; architectural pattern. The vast majority of the American population lives in a landscape consisting of freestanding houses, roadways, and utilitarian shopping areas with large parking lots. Because the density is low, the driving distances are quite typically rather high. Americans spend more time commuting to work than almost anyone on Earth. In many places, there are no foot paths, and in many other places where they do exist, they are a strict formality, with nary a pedestrian in sight. One could not be blamed for coming away with the impression that cars are first-class objects on the American terra firma, while pedestrians are distinctly second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think I’m describing the countryside and rural areas, but no. In fact, this is all true even in places that nominally market themselves as “cities”. All of the major growing “cities” of the Sun Belt, such as Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, which developed in the postwar automobile boom, are in fact little more than vast agglomerations of bland suburban tract, separated by vast lengths of highway. Sometimes they’re wrapped around a small, central urban core, but in most cases that’s just a small financial district, or a depressed post-industrial nexus of economic decay. Either way, most of the population doesn’t live there, and these cores are neither a central feature of American aspirations nor of life in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has certain upsides. It theory, it allows one to feel as if one lives in the peaceful retreat of the countryside while having the amenities of a nearby conurbation. This might seem like a refreshing prospect to someone who has lived amidst the constant din and crowds of Yerevan their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralised infrastructure and penetrating roadway network required to support this also gives rise to equalisation and homogeneity. The material level of life in Evergreen, Alabama isn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; that different from life in New York City. Sure, it’s definitely different, but the differences are mostly a matter of small nuances. Broadly, you have access to essentially the same supply chains of commoditised groceries, fuel, medicine and services in the countryside as you do in a megapolis. This is rather different from most of the rest of the world, including Armenia, where everyone knows there’s Yerevan, and there’s not-Yerevan, and the developmental chasm between them can sometimes seem to be almost be measurable in centuries, depending on where exactly you go. Much of the US is very homogenous in both practical and aesthetic terms. You’ll have to come to New York for world-class neurosurgery, but you can drive on good roads, go bowling, and go to the same supermarket and buy the same &lt;em&gt;Cheetos&lt;/em&gt; pretty much anywhere, even in the tiniest hamlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, people are always surprised when I lean on this aspect of the US critically, as a primary reason for low quality of life. It’s a topic that receives so little attention it may as well be categorised as “a problem that has no name”. The reality, however, is that the impact of this way of designing the world goes far beyond mere aesthestics–which, by the way, are terrible; the suburban landscape is unrivaled in its monotony and depressing blandness. The problem is more insidious, though; the way that we build our settlements has deep implications for our civic life, our communities, our patterns of interaction, the relationships we form, the company we keep, and ultimately, the purpose and meaning we find in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the rest of the world takes for granted architectural principles of how to build life-affirming human settlements. These principles evolved over thousands of years, and it’s no accident that so many cultures reached the same conclusions. Urban Europeans, and indeed Armenians, are accustomed to vertical growth, mixed-use development (shops on first floor, apartments above), sidewalks, plazas, public squares and street cafes. These are the fixtures amidst which your halcyon childhood days played out, where you walked hand in hand with your first love, where you met friends for coffee, and hopped the train to work. It’s the corner with the pastry shop, it’s the supermarket down the street, and the bench in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people can prepare themselves for the degree to which Americans have, in the last half-century or so, taken this &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; corpus of human experience and thrown it &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; into the trash, with the exception of a few older cities–not the places where the majority of Americans live. What has replaced it is a surreal moonscape. For those accustomed to the traditional urban civilisation, the primary question in America is: where do I go? What do I do? Looking around leads to an intangible but intense realisation of emptiness. Suburbia is both a cause and an effect of the destruction of civic and community life in America: there’s increasingly little to come home to, and vanishingly little to go out to. This has real effects. Your children will have nowhere to play, as there is no courtyard full of friends; they will depend on your willingness to drive them (sometimes quite far) for prearranged “play dates”. You will not take leisurely strolls to admire the scenery, for there is neither admirable scenery nor anywhere to stroll. It’s likely that you won’t even know your neighbours. You certainly can’t venture downstairs for lettuce or milk; strict zoning codes have ensured that only residential structures can be built where you live, and you’ll have to drive a few miles to reach the commercial zone, where the grocery stores are.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architect James Howard Kunstler &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia?language=en&quot;&gt;does a good job of anatomising the essential problems of suburbia in this TED talk&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t necessarily share all of his ideological accents, but I think he’s summed up the general problem very nicely. The thing you have to realise when watching that video is that he’s not talking about a particular kind of neighbourhood; he’s talking about &lt;em&gt;the overwhelming majority of the US&lt;/em&gt;, including places others are accustomed to thinking of as cities. Dallas, for instance, is not a city by the global standards. Much of it should probably be reclassified as a rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this atmosphere, the almighty car–still a matter of social status, prestige and perceived convenience in Armenia–falls from grace. It’s no longer a luxurious way to thumb your nose at the teeming masses. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; one of the teeming masses. A lot of your energy and money and will go toward the purchase and upkeep of a rapidly depreciating hunk of metal in which you will spend a significant fraction of your life, all alone. It’s only cool when most people don’t have one; when four wheels have replaced two feet, it’s just a needlessly expensive way to traverse pointlessly large distances of identical-looking road for unclear reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that public transportation doesn’t exist in the US–at least, not by European standards. Unless you live in New York City, or well within the centres of Chicago or one or two other cities, you’ll need a car, and you’ll be spending a lot of time in it. Guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a culture as warm and sociable as that of Armenians, this is all anathema. Truly committed people can maintain friendships and connections across the most hostile landscapes, but so much of how we meet and relate to others is inextricably bound up in the convenience and opportunity in how we are situated. Physical layout cannot, by itself, either make one friends or hinder those who are determined to have them anyway. But it does matter. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I’m moved to say that one of the most important things about the US is that it’s lonely. They built it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No list of American peculiarities can be complete without due mention of its legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is not the only country to have a Byzantine legal code or statutes both complex and numerous, although both of those things are certainly true. Compared to the rest of the developed world, the US criminal justice system is harsh and metes out severe sentences. It often seems to have more punitive than rehabilitative aims, and this is, in general, politically rewarded, fed by intense “get tough on crime” populism. It’s aggravated by what might be described as a “prison-industrial complex” of legislative machinery and lobbying–one that extends to and encapsulates vested law enforcement institutions. It is a major contributor to the result that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/us-incarceration.aspx&quot;&gt;the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world&lt;/a&gt;. Not the developed world. The whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are some eccentricities of Anglo-American common law that people coming from a CIS legal system are sure to find bewildering. One is the enormous amount of personal discretion that is afforded to prosecutors and other individual actors in a criminal case. In many other countries, there are statutes that clearly outline the process a state prosecutor must follow. In the US, a lot more depends on the whims of the concrete personalities involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, over 90% of American criminal cases are settled by “plea bargaining”, a technique where the accused and the prosecutor make a deal to exchange the accused’s guilty plea for reduced charges. That is to say, the prosecution is allowed to literally change the accusation being made from the same body of evidence: “Instead of felony armed robbery, we are going to charge you with a misdemeanour of ‘disturbing the peace’.”  The official argument for this practice is that it saves public resources by avoiding the expense and complexity of a trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this flexibility leads to inflated charges that the prosecution cannot support in a real trial. The prosecution gambles that the defendant will be intimidated by the worst-case possibility of conviction for grandiose charges, and will settle for the certainty of conviction on lesser charges over the uncertainty of conviction on bigger ones. The prosecution gets a higher conviction rate, which is politically beneficial. The effect is class-discriminatory: well-heeled defendants who can afford good legal representation, post a bail-bond and have time on their hands will fight the prosecution, while poorer defendants will fold and settle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By American lights, this passes for justice, which leads to a larger and more important point: the US criminal justice system is overwhelmingly preoccupied with procedure and process, often at the expense of justice. This myopia is the product of a technocratic bureaucracy. It’s summed up nicely in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/the-caging-of-america&quot;&gt;a New Yorker article called “The Caging of America”:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;William J. Stuntz, a professor at Harvard Law School who died shortly before his masterwork, “The Collapse of American Criminal Justice,” was published, last fall, is the most forceful advocate for the view that the scandal of our prisons derives from the Enlightenment-era, “procedural” nature of American justice. He runs through the immediate causes of the incarceration epidemic: the growth of post-Rockefeller drug laws, which punished minor drug offenses with major prison time; “zero tolerance” policing, which added to the group; mandatory-sentencing laws, which prevented judges from exercising judgment. But his search for the ultimate cause leads deeper, all the way to the Bill of Rights. In a society where Constitution worship is still a requisite on right and left alike, Stuntz startlingly suggests that the Bill of Rights is a terrible document with which to start a justice system—much inferior to the exactly contemporary French Declaration of the Rights of Man, which Jefferson, he points out, may have helped shape while his protégé Madison was writing ours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trouble with the Bill of Rights, he argues, is that it emphasizes process and procedure rather than principles. The Declaration of the Rights of Man says, Be just! The Bill of Rights says, Be fair! Instead of announcing general principles—no one should be accused of something that wasn’t a crime when he did it; cruel punishments are always wrong; the goal of justice is, above all, that justice be done—it talks procedurally. You can’t search someone without a reason; you can’t accuse him without allowing him to see the evidence; and so on. This emphasis, Stuntz thinks, has led to the current mess, where accused criminals get laboriously articulated protection against procedural errors and no protection at all against outrageous and obvious violations of simple justice. You can get off if the cops looked in the wrong car with the wrong warrant when they found your joint, but you have no recourse if owning the joint gets you locked up for life. You may be spared the death penalty if you can show a problem with your appointed defender, but it is much harder if there is merely enormous accumulated evidence that you weren’t guilty in the first place and the jury got it wrong. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of immigrants inadvertently get into legal trouble in the US because they fail to realise how much the system is focused on the correctness of process rather than the holistic propriety–and indeed, the humanity–of the outcome. Such concerns are far too “interpretive” to enter into anyone’s mind. The contemporary incarnation of the peculiar mindset of Anglo-American jurisprudence leads to the question, “Were the rights of all parties, as enumerated by the law, protected?”, eclipsing the much larger issue: “Is this outcome compatible with justice?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I have known Soviet immigrants who got into serious legal problems because of family and child custody-related problems. In one case, a mother was prosecuted with felony kidnapping for taking her child from a husband who himself had fled with the child, and who obviously had malevolent motives and committed extensive fraud. Common sense should say that she had understandable reasons for doing that. The American system says she interfered with a custody order (that he had supposedly obtained somewhere) and thus committed kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graduate family housing community where I grew up, I seemed to have been one of few ex-Soviet children whose parents somehow avoided charges of child neglect. All of our parents were busy graduate students who worked all day and all night, and none of them knew that in the State of Indiana, it is illegal to leave a child under 12 years old home alone. In our home countries, schoolchildren of single-digit age routinely commuted to and from school alone. We were in a safe, enclosed community with an abundance of constant adult supervision from stay-at-home mothers; common sense should say that this is not child neglect, in that the parents’ intentions were not negligent, and us latchkey kids were not, in fact, being neglected. The authorities were not concerned with that; leaving a child under 12 home alone meets the statutory definition of child neglect, therefore it’s child neglect–end of story. There was no allowance for mitigating factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this rigidity should be confused with effectiveness or precision. It’s not the same as a Germanic fastidiousness for law and order or attention to detail. German courts still consider the issue of whether a verdict and a sentence is consistent with the spirit or intent of the law. One of the key functions of a judge is to interpret that in a given scenario. American authorities are zealously preoccupied with much more narrow concerns of definition, execution and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows up in civil law as well. The US is probably the most litigious society on the planet, leading to rather mechanistic approaches to the assignment of liability and risk. You’ll find yourself signing a lot of disclaimers, releases and waivers of liability for things that offend all sentient reason, and you’ll find yourself needing to take peculiar and cumbersome steps to ensure that you yourself are held harmless and indemnified in a variety of scenarios you would not have customarily assumed yourself to carry liability for. McDonald’s Corporation really &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be held liable if you spill hot coffee on yourself, and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; that’s good, but if you employ a mechanic and &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; spills hot coffee on himself while on the job, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; might be held liable. Is that as strange as it sounds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social safety net and state services (or lack thereof)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For paying essentially similar tax rates to Western Europeans, Americans do not receive many state benefits, nor are able to rely on a substantial social safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, the American body politic is chlorerically opposed to perceived “socialism”. This means that extensive taxpayer-funded social benefits are an impossible political sell in one of the richest countries on the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that in many cases, you pay (at least) double; you both pay relatively high taxes, and pay out of your own pocket for things you wouldn’t have to pay for in Western Europe and many other developed countries. Healthcare is the most obvious and dire example, as I discussed above, but the same is largely true of child care, housing, university education, and, despite the existence of Social Security, pension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There do exist unemployment benefits, disability benefits and government income assistance schemes to the very poor. The problem is rather that these programs provide very little compared to most developed-world countries, and are very limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Armenians sometimes scoff at Americans for delaying having children until their thirties. Notwithstanding cultural causes, it’s worth noting that the expense of child care is expected to be shouldered by working parents themselves. The government does not provide, at a large scale, any sort of preschool or daycare, as is the case in many other developed countries. These services are available in private form, but are quite expensive, often so expensive as to substantially offset the income realised from liberating a parent to work. Quality cannot be counted upon; many of the cheaper daycare centres are little more than holding pens or warehouses for children, performing little to no useful pedagogical function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private university can cost tens of thousands of dollars annually in tuition. Public universities can be considerably cheaper, but the price is still well into the five figures once total cost of attendance, including boarding and meals, is considered. Some scholarships and financial aid from the universities is available, but not enough to realistically provide most students a way to afford attendance. The actual way most American university students afford university is by going into enormous debt, in the form of semi-government-sponsored student loans. It’s not uncommon to pay these loans back for the rest of one’s life, and they are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. All in all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/specialfeatures/2013/08/07/how-the-college-debt-is-crippling-students-parents-and-the-economy/&quot;&gt;American students owe &lt;em&gt;$1.2 trillion dollars&lt;/em&gt; in student loans, and the average debt is $26000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home state of Georgia is rare in that it offers a rather novel form of state scholarship for state residents to attend public university in Georgia. The HOPE scholarship waives tuition if one qualifies on the basis of high school marks. How is it funded? Through state lottery ticket sales. It’s an upward income redistribution scheme; most buyers of lottery tickets are relatively poor and uneducated, and most recipients of the HOPE scholarship are middle-class kids from relatively affluent households. Because HOPE is awarded on the basis of academic performance, income is not a factor. This is a barometer of what is politically possible in America: upward income redistribution is okay, but to even imagine that the state itself could fund tuition directly? That would be socialism!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal housing aid for the very poor does exist, in the form of so-called Section 8 housing. But Section 8 housing is not somewhere you’d want to live unless you like gunshots and heroin needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Security was created in the 1930s to provide income security in old age. It is a mandatory government pension scheme. However, one would be crazy to rely on Social Security income alone in retirement; the payouts are quite low relative to contributions, which means that for most people, it’s not enough to live on. It should not be confused for an actual pension. Moreover, there are some unsettling questions about the long-term solvency of the fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandatory paid holiday in the US, where it exists, is limited to two weeks per year, and applies only to full-time, salaried employees. A great deal of employment in the US is in the form of part-time work, where the employer is not required to provide this or most other benefits. It is increasingly combined with paid illness time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: for their ~40%, the Europeans get more. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individualism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anglo-American cultural heritage is uniquely individualistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be a welcome respite to Armenian denizens who are weary from a lifetime of collective social responsibilities and living for the concerns of others, and who may be eager for some privacy and freedom from gossip and judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that the other side of this can lead to a lot of culture shock. With due recognition to the fact that the US is diverse and has many subcultures, including very close-knit ones, it’s fair to say that the American ethos is decidedly more self-centred. The prevailing cultural expectation is that most people will take care of themselves and keep to themselves, and avoid being a burden to others in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, there’s a lot to appreciate about this. But it also means that the concern you are accustomed to feeling from others for your well-being will fall off sharply. You can’t just take for granted that you can go ask your neighbour for a favour without a second thought; if you don’t know them well, it would be unseemly. In my personal experience, some Americans have even been known to respond in a hostile fashion to strangers knocking on their door. “Trespassing” and “privacy” are terms that get thrown around often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that Americans are uncaring or unaffectionate people, by the way. It’s hard to make that generalisation about over 300 million people. Some of them are very caring. I’m just saying that if you are found to have signs of a meningioma and go in for an MRI scan, you might expect eight to ten friends and relatives to take time off work to show up with you and weep in anticipation in the waiting room. You will not find that here, and you’ll feel a sharp crash and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and large, you are expected to take care of your own personal business in America and to “manage” your emotions and not allow them to interfere with your work. The inability of many human beings to actually meet this standard might explain why approximately half the American population is on some sort of psychotropic medication, e.g. antidepressants. If you need the Yerevan standard of personal involvement from others, the Anglo-American culture is about the worst for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of drugs–and I feel this is quite germane to the issue of “individualism” and social psychology, which is why I put it in this section: drugs they are a huge and extremely pervasive social problem, and you’re bound to collide with that reality sooner or later, directly or indirectly. A substantial proportion of the GDP depends in some way either on the production, distribution and consumption of drugs, or on enforcing draconian laws against it. There’s quite a lot of what one might call industrial-scale militarisation on both sides. Like any war, it’s damaging even to the victors, there is enormous collateral damage to civilian bystanders, and it’s hard to tell who the real villains are. By Armenian standards, the US can be criminal, gritty and dangerous in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, perhaps, the world of legal drugs bleeds easily into the illegal, as evidenced by widespread illegal abuse of prescription painkillers and the entirely legal overprescription of psychoactive medications such as amphetamines. Americans are probably the most psychoactively medicated people on the planet. The whole legal-illegal distinction is a nebulous, foggy continuum in a place with so much regulatory capture and other corruption driven by mega-pharmaceutical shysterism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I tell every Yerevan taxi driver who lyricises America, “like everything else, it’s got its pluses and minuses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is a good place for the incorrigibly entrepreneurial and the well-paid, and in either case, the young. It’s a good place to be if you’re in a well-remunerated profession that is complementary to machine intelligence and other emergent trends indicative of the future of employment in “post-industrial” economies. It still offers a dynamic business climate–something that is as much a function of culture as of regulation and economics. It’s an intriguingly diverse multicultural “melting pot” where just about anyone can find a social group of likeminded people, which owes much to both its size and its history as a nation of immigrants. If the more collectivist psychology of the East is your vexation, the strong current of individualism and independence in American culture would probably an ideal antidote. For certain kinds of people, the US has much to recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I hope I have tempered that with some sober realities about the challenges of everyday life. The US lacks many of the socially stabilising factors and policy objectives of Western European countries. If you’re looking for a calm, moderate life and are allergic to extremes, I suggest you set your sights upon another OECD country to romanticise. Either way, I would pause and take a minute before reflexively deeming a visiting American to be enviably rich and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no paradise anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: 33 line React</title>
<link>https://leontrolski.github.io/33-line-react.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://leontrolski.github.io/33-line-react.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;leontrolski - 33 line React&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/highlightjs@9.16.2/styles/default.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;138.22095435685&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you pass in a function that &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt; state and &lt;em&gt;returns&lt;/em&gt; a virtual DOM (just a tree of plain ol' &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; objects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it renders that virtual DOM as a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; DOM in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you change the state, it runs the function again, this returns a new virtual DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it efficiently updates the real DOM so that it matches the new virtual DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does a load of other crap as well, but we're going to ignore that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to make the smallest React-like thing that can do the above. It's very &lt;a href=&quot;https://mithril.js.org/&quot;&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt; influenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample &lt;a href=&quot;https://leontrolski.github.io/33-line-react-calendar.html&quot;&gt;calendar picker application&lt;/a&gt; that uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/master/33-line-react.js&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of the code looks pretty code-golfy - I promise I don't do stuff like this at work, neither should you :-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noughts and crosses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to make this noughts and crosses game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at the code to this, you can also just view the page source if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;let currentPlayer = 'o'
let winner = null
const g = [['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]  // grid

const move = (value, i, j)=&amp;gt;{
    // ... game logic goes here
    renderNoughts()
}

const Cell = (value, i, j)=&amp;gt;m('button.cell',
    {onclick: ()=&amp;gt;move(value, i, j)}, value
)
const Noughts = ()=&amp;gt;m('',
    winner
        ? m('marquee', `winner: ${winner}`)
        : m('h3', `current player: ${currentPlayer}`),
    m('table', g.map(
        (row, i)=&amp;gt;m('tr', row.map(
            (value, j)=&amp;gt;m('td', {class: value}, Cell(value, i, j)))))),
)

const renderNoughts = ()=&amp;gt;m.render(
    document.getElementById('noughts'),
    {children: [Noughts()]},
)
renderNoughts()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute, so what's going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we defined some state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;let currentPlayer = 'o'
let winner = null
const g = [['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]  // grid&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These hold the state of our game, we will mutate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;const move = (value, i, j){...}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function makes a move in the game, it takes &lt;code&gt;'x'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'o'&lt;/code&gt; along with 2 integer coordinates. It will mutate all the state variables to reflect the new state of the game. After that, it calls &lt;code&gt;renderNoughts()&lt;/code&gt;, this is a call to rerender the game - but we'll come back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we define the functions that return virtual DOMs, &lt;code&gt;Noughts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Cell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;m(...)&lt;/code&gt; calls take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a tag name (eg. &lt;code&gt;'tr'&lt;/code&gt;), with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;-separated class names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) a &lt;code&gt;{string: any}&lt;/code&gt; object containing all the attributes to attach to the DOM node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an arbitrarily nested list of &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt; - these are other virtual DOM nodes or strings of text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And return virtual DOM elements, for example, calling &lt;code&gt;Noughts()&lt;/code&gt; would return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{
    tag: 'div',
    attrs: {},
    classes: [],
    children: [
        {
            tag: 'h3',
            attrs: {},
            classes: [],
            children: [
                'current player: x'
            ]
        },
        {
            tag: 'table',
            attrs: {},
            classes: [],
            children: [
                {
                    tag: 'tr',
                    attrs: {},
                    classes: [],
                    children: [
...&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we make the function &lt;code&gt;renderNoughts()&lt;/code&gt;, when you call it, it will call our &lt;code&gt;Noughts&lt;/code&gt; function, and attempt to efficiently render the resulting virtual DOM onto &lt;code&gt;document.getElementById('noughts')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/master/33-line-react-with-comments.js&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/master/33-line-react.js&quot;&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; comments.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to trim video clips instantly without reencoding</title>
<link>https://bernd.dev/2020/04/trim-videos-instantly/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bernd.dev/2020/04/trim-videos-instantly/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Is your video too long for upload to Twitter or Instagram? Do you want to export just a specific clip? Using video editors to trim videos requires reencoding the entire video. Instead I will show you how to &lt;strong&gt;instantly&lt;/strong&gt; trim your videos and even maintain embedded subtitle tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I created a post on easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://bernd.dev/2020/04/adding-subtitles/&quot;&gt;adding subtitles to your videos&lt;/a&gt;. Today I wanted to verify that Twitter correctly shows these subtitles, but I discovered that my video was too long. Having played with &lt;strong&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/strong&gt; I suspected that there may be a more efficient way for trimming videos than using a video editor. Be prepared to have your mind blown! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ffmpeg&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need the open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ffmpeg.org/&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.org/download.html&quot;&gt;installation instructions here&lt;/a&gt;. On Mac, simply use &lt;em&gt;Homebrew&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;code&gt;brew install ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instantly-trim-videos&quot;&gt;Instantly trim videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command reads the source video and copies all streams contained within (video, audio, subtitles) to the output. The various time parameters ensure only a specific part of the original video is written to the output. &lt;strong&gt;The video and audio streams are not reencoded.&lt;/strong&gt; The time required for reencoding would directly depend on the duration of the video, however we are simply copying parts of the video. For this reason &lt;strong&gt;the following operation is near instant&lt;/strong&gt;. A huge time saving over workflows involving video editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;INFILE=&quot;video.mp4&quot;
OUTFILE=&quot;shortenedclip.mp4&quot;

START=&quot;00:00:12.35&quot;     # Start Time in hh:mm:ss.msec format
DURATION=&quot;00:01:05.4&quot;   # Duration in hh:mm:ss.msec format

################## Alternative format ##################
# START=&quot;12.35&quot;      # Start time in s.msec format     #
# DURATION=&quot;65.4&quot;    # Duration time in s.msec format  #
########################################################

ffmpeg -ss $START -i $INFILE -c copy -map 0 -t $DURATION $OUTFILE

# If you prefer you can also specify an end time similar to the start time

END=&quot;00:01:12.75&quot;
ffmpeg -ss $START -i $INFILE -c copy -map 0 -to $END $OUTFILE

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
