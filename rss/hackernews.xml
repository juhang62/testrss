&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;If you're considering a move into freelancing or consulting - the one question that's probably on your mind is: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;How will I find clients?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;That's the one question I hear most often when I talk about consulting - and it's the one question I felt most vividly when I first started consulting independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The good news is that there is a relatively straightforward path for finding new clients. Yes, it takes some time, and yes, it can be a bit of a grind - but you can get there. Here's how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;If you're like most consultants, the primary way you'll find most of your contracts is through people you already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;That sounds like unhelpful advice - but it really points to the type of activity you need to be doing if you think you want to do consulting at some point... you need to get to know people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;That doesn't mean you should go &quot;networking&quot; - it means really getting out and getting to know people that fit in your area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The best way to do that is by finding local meetups in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;If you're a software developer, find a local group for your language of choice, and go visit. After a few meetings, offer to give a lightning talk. Then a few months later give a full length talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;You'll grow a lot as a developer by doing those things - and you'll also get to know people who work for companies that could hire you down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The next most important piece of the puzzle is some public proof that you know what you're doing... how can potential clients trust that you can get the work done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;This could be a portfolio, or blog, or ebook (ebooks are magic for this) - but make sure you have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to point to that shows you are an expert in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;It seems like obvious advice - but you'd be surprised at how many consultants don't have a public demonstration that they're an expert... and then have trouble finding clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Think about it from the client's perspective: &lt;strong&gt;how can you be trusted with their work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Ok - so you've gone to meetups, and you have a blog or ebook or youtube channel or podcast... now how do you actually get a client?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; Start mentioning that you're looking for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Again - this sounds like obvious advice, but you need to actually do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Go to the local people who you've met and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&quot;I'm starting to look for companies who need help with [X] - do you know of anyone I should talk to?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The phrasing of that question is important. If you just ask them if &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; company is looking for consultants - then you're really limited their answers to just &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;By asking if there is &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; you should talk to though - they'll really think about other people they know as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Most of my clients in the past have not come directly from people I knew - but people who knew people I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; Be watchful for hidden opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Tech companies are continually looking for people to fill software development roles. When people in your network post about their company looking to hire someone in your field of work - that's a great time to reach out and ask if they're ever interested in hiring contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The answer might be &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not right now&quot; - but you will have at least planted a seed in their mind that you're someone who is looking for clients - and that will often pay off months, or even years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Another method that works well is to be a sub-contractor for another consulting company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;You won't make quite the same money that you could if you went direct to clients - but you also don't have the same hassles that you might if you were in charge of the client relationship; so there are some tradeoffs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;To do this, find a consulting company (start small: 5 - 10 person companies are often the most open to these arrangements), and just send an email to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&quot;I'm a consultant for [X] and see that you do that as well. Do you ever have projects that you need help with?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Many small software consultancies I know about have more work than they can handle at one time or another - so you'll be surprised at how often this type of email will lead to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Sometimes though - you just can't wait... you need a client quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;In those cases, it can be tempting to go to one of the few big freelancing sites out there and look for work - but &lt;strong&gt;don't do that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Instead, here's what I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Look on tech job boards for jobs that you know you could do, and that have emails of the people who are actually looking to hire (not HR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Reach out to those people directly and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&quot;I'm not looking for a full time position, but would you be open to a contractor?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;You'll get a lot of people who don't respond, and a fair number of people who say &quot;no&quot; - but I'm often surprised by how many are interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Smaller companies are often more open to these arrangements (less red tape), and it's best if you can get the direct email of the person who leads the technical team - so look for those situations especially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Also - if you do get a &quot;no&quot;, you can always follow up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;&quot;No problem - do you know anyone else I should talk to?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;The tech world is fairly small - and so don't waste an opportunity to ask for introductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;Independent consulting sounds big and scary at first, but remember - you only really need a few clients to have a really good year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;This isn't a high-volume sales game; but rather it's more about getting to know people and showing that you can do the work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;That doesn't mean it's easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;...but right now the world is clamoring for more and more software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-yw8fqx ekpbdit0&quot;&gt;So don't get discouraged by the &quot;No&quot;s... you only need a few &quot;yes&quot;es to make it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Async-await on stable Rust</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Nov. 07, 2019 · Niko Matsakis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;128.46428571429&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On this coming Thursday, November 7, async-await syntax hits stable Rust, as part of the 1.39.0 release.&lt;/strong&gt; This work has been a long time in development -- the key ideas for zero-cost futures, for example, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/&quot;&gt;first proposed by Aaron Turon and Alex Crichton in 2016&lt;/a&gt;! -- and we are very proud of the end result. We believe that Async I/O is going to be an increasingly important part of Rust's story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this first release of &quot;async-await&quot; is a momentous event, it's also only the beginning. The current support for async-await marks a kind of &quot;Minimum Viable Product&quot; (MVP). We expect to be polishing, improving, and extending it for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, in the time since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/30/Async-await-hits-beta.html&quot;&gt;async-await hit beta&lt;/a&gt;, we've made a lot of great progress, including making some &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/10/11/AsyncAwait-Not-Send-Error-Improvements.html&quot;&gt;key diagnostic improvements&lt;/a&gt; that help to make async-await errors far more approachable. To get involved in that work, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/async-await/&quot;&gt;Async Foundations Working Group&lt;/a&gt;; if nothing else, you can help us by filing bugs about polish issues or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/async-await/#nominating-issues&quot;&gt;nominating those bugs that are bothering you the most&lt;/a&gt;, to help direct our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks are due to the people who made async-await a reality. The implementation and design would never have happened without the leadership of cramertj and withoutboats, the implementation and polish work from the compiler side (davidtwco, tmandry, gilescope, csmoe), the core generator support that futures builds on (Zoxc), the foundational work on &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Pin&lt;/code&gt; APIs (aturon, alexcrichton, RalfJ, pythonesque), and of course the input provided by so many community members on RFC threads and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that async-await is approaching stabilization, all the major Async I/O runtimes are at work adding and extending their support for the new syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Async-await: a quick primer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This section and the next are reproduced from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/30/Async-await-hits-beta.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Async-await hits beta!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; post.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is async await? Async-await is a way to write functions that can &quot;pause&quot;, return control to the runtime, and then pick up from where they left off. Typically those pauses are to wait for I/O, but there can be any number of uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with the async-await from JavaScript or C#. Rust's version of the feature is similar, but with a few key differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use async-await, you start by writing &lt;code&gt;async fn&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;async fn first_function() -&amp;gt; u32 { .. }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a regular function, calling an &lt;code&gt;async fn&lt;/code&gt; doesn't have any immediate effect. Instead, it returns a &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt;. This is a suspended computation that is waiting to be executed. To actually &lt;em&gt;execute&lt;/em&gt; the future, use the &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt; operator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;async fn another_function() {
    // Create the future:
    let future = first_function();
    
    // Await the future, which will execute it (and suspend
    // this function if we encounter a need to wait for I/O): 
    let result: u32 = future.await;
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example shows the first difference between Rust and other languages: we write &lt;code&gt;future.await&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;await future&lt;/code&gt;. This syntax integrates better with Rust's &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator for propagating errors (which, after all, are very common in I/O). You can simply write &lt;code&gt;future.await?&lt;/code&gt; to await the result of a future and propagate errors. It also has the advantage of making method chaining painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero-cost futures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other difference between Rust futures and futures in JS and C# is that they are based on a &quot;poll&quot; model, which makes them &lt;strong&gt;zero cost&lt;/strong&gt;. In other languages, invoking an async function immediately creates a future and schedules it for execution: awaiting the future isn't necessary for it to execute. But this implies some overhead for each future that is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, in Rust, calling an async function does not do any scheduling in and of itself, which means that we can compose a complex nest of futures without incurring a per-future cost. As an end-user, though, the main thing you'll notice is that &lt;strong&gt;futures feel &quot;lazy&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: they don't do anything until you await them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like a closer look at how futures work under the hood, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html&quot;&gt;the executor section&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/async-book&quot;&gt;async book&lt;/a&gt;, or watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skos4B5x7qE&quot;&gt;excellent talk&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withoutboats&quot;&gt;withoutboats&lt;/a&gt; gave at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustlatam.org/&quot;&gt;Rust LATAM 2019&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that having async-await on stable Rust is going to be a key enabler for a lot of new and exciting developments in Rust. If you've tried Async I/O in Rust in the past and had problems -- particularly if you tried the combinator-based futures of the past -- you'll find &lt;a href=&quot;http://aturon.github.io/tech/2018/04/24/async-borrowing/&quot;&gt;async-await integrates much better with Rust's borrowing system&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, there are now a number of great runtimes and other libraries available in the ecosystem to work with. So get out there and build stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 1.39</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Rust-1.39.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Rust-1.39.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Nov. 07, 2019 · The Rust Release Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;145.84402869329&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.39.0. Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.39.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot;&gt;rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#version-1390-2019-11-07&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.39.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in 1.39.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights of Rust 1.39.0 include &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt;, shared references to by-move bindings in &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; guards, and attributes on function parameters. Also, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#version-1390-2019-11-07&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt; is over, &lt;code&gt;async fn&lt;/code&gt;s are here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously in Rust 1.36.0, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html#the-future-is-here&quot;&gt;we announced&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/future/trait.Future.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trait is here. Back then, we noted that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this stabilization, we hope to give important crates, libraries, and the ecosystem time to prepare for &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt;, which we'll tell you more about in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promise made is a promise kept. So in Rust 1.39.0, we are pleased to announce that &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt; is stabilized! Concretely, this means that you can define &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; functions and blocks and &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; function, which you can introduce by writing &lt;code&gt;async fn&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;, does nothing other than to return a &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt; when called. This &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt; is a suspended computation which you can drive to completion by &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt;ing it. Besides &lt;code&gt;async fn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;async { ... }&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;async move { ... }&lt;/code&gt; blocks, which act like closures, can be used to define &quot;async literals&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on the release of &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.await&lt;/code&gt;, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html&quot;&gt;Niko Matsakis's blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;References to by-move bindings in &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; guards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pattern matching in Rust, a variable, also known as a &quot;binding&quot;, can be bound in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by-reference, either immutably or mutably. This can be achieved explicitly e.g. through &lt;code&gt;ref my_var&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ref mut my_var&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Most of the time though, the binding mode will be inferred automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by-value -- either by-copy, when the bound variable's type implements &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;, or otherwise &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;by-move&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Rust would forbid taking shared references to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;by-move&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bindings in the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; guards of &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; expressions. This meant that the following code would be rejected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let array: Box&amp;lt;[u8; 4]&amp;gt; = Box::new([1, 2, 3, 4]);

    match array {
        nums
//      ---- `nums` is bound by move.
            if nums.iter().sum::&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;() == 10
//                 ^------ `.iter()` implicitly takes a reference to `nums`.
        =&amp;gt; {
            drop(nums);
//          ----------- `nums` was bound by move and so we have ownership.
        }
        _ =&amp;gt; unreachable!(),
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63118/#issuecomment-522823925&quot;&gt;With Rust 1.39.0&lt;/a&gt;, the snippet above is now accepted by the compiler. We hope that this will give a smoother and more consistent experience with &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; expressions overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attributes on function parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rust 1.39.0, attributes are now allowed on parameters of functions, closures, and function pointers. Whereas before, you might have written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;#[cfg(windows)]
fn len(slice: &amp;amp;[u16]) -&amp;gt; usize {
    slice.len()
}
#[cfg(not(windows))] 
fn len(slice: &amp;amp;[u8]) -&amp;gt; usize {
    slice.len()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64010/&quot;&gt;you can now&lt;/a&gt;, more succinctly, write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn len(
    #[cfg(windows)] slice: &amp;amp;[u16], // This parameter is used on Windows.
    #[cfg(not(windows))] slice: &amp;amp;[u8], // Elsewhere, this one is used.
) -&amp;gt; usize {
    slice.len()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes you can use in this position include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditional compilation: &lt;code&gt;cfg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cfg_attr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling lints: &lt;code&gt;allow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;warn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;deny&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;forbid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helper attributes used by procedural macro attributes applied to items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is that this will be used to provide more readable and ergonomic macro-based DSLs throughout the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Borrow check migration warnings are hard errors in Rust 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1.35.0 release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html#nll-for-rust-2015&quot;&gt;we announced&lt;/a&gt; that NLL had come to Rust 2015 after first being released for Rust 2018 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html#non-lexical-lifetimes&quot;&gt;1.31&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in the 1.35.0 release, the old borrow checker had some bugs which would allow memory unsafety. These bugs were fixed by the NLL borrow checker. As these fixes broke some stable code, we decided to gradually phase in the errors by checking if the old borrow checker would accept the program and the NLL checker would reject it. If so, the errors would instead become warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rust 1.39.0, these warnings are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63565&quot;&gt;errors in Rust 2018&lt;/a&gt;. In the next release, Rust 1.40.0, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64221&quot;&gt;this will also apply to Rust 2015&lt;/a&gt;, which will finally allow us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64790&quot;&gt;remove the old borrow checker&lt;/a&gt;, and keep the compiler clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are affected, or want to hear more, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/01/nll-hard-errors.html&quot;&gt;Niko Matsakis's blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More &lt;code&gt;const fn&lt;/code&gt;s in the standard library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rust 1.39.0, the following functions became &lt;code&gt;const fn&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additions to the standard library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.39.0 the following functions were stabilized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other changes in the Rust 1.39.0 release: check out what changed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#version-1390-2019-11-07&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-139-2019-11-07&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-139&quot;&gt;Clippy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#compatibility-notes&quot;&gt;compatibility notes&lt;/a&gt; to check if you're affected by those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors to 1.39.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.39.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.39.0/&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD Q4:16-core Ryzen 9 3950X, Threadripper Up To 32-Core 3970X</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/print/15062/amds-2019-fall-update</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/print/15062/amds-2019-fall-update</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AMD is set to close out the year on a high note. As promised, the company will be delivering its latest 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X processor, built with two 7nm TSMC chiplets, to the consumer platform for $749. Not only this, but AMD today has lifted the covers on its next generation Threadripper platform, which includes Zen 2-based chiplets, a new socket, and an astounding 4x increase in CPU-to-chipset bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year AMD is presenting its ‘Fall 2019 Desktop Update’, covering the new products for the holiday season. Q4 is historically a good target for increased consumer sales, as long as the products hit the right price point and are available in volume for the peak shopping periods. We’ve been waiting mercilessly for more details about the crème-de-la-crème of what AMD has to offer with its 7nm product portfolio for both mainstream Ryzen desktop processors, but also the creator and workstation focused 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Threadripper. After continuously requesting information from CEO Lisa Su since the middle of the year, AMD is lifting the lid on the product details, pricing, and launch dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-001_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version of today’s announcement revolves around several parts, in completely different markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ryzen 9 3950X 16-core CPU for desktops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Family: Starting with the 24-core 3960X and 32-core 3970X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New TRX40 motherboards for the new Threadripper Processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new $49 Athlon 3000G for the entry level market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this hardware is set to come to market through the month of November at the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ryzen 9 3950X: Retail on November 25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TR 3960X and TR 3970X on November 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRX40 motherboards on November 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Athlon 3000G on November 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-015.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-015_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key takeaway from today’s announcements is how AMD is moving the traditional desktop and high-end desktop markets. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14579/all-ryzen-qa-with-amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su&quot;&gt;CEO Dr. Lisa Su was asked earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; what will happen to Threadripper as the mainstream Ryzen family moves ‘up’ in performance, her response was that ‘Threadripper will move up-up’. To that effect, we are seeing AMD’s delineation between mainstream desktop and high-end desktop move up to between 16-core and 24-core, with room at the top for more cores if AMD wants to go that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anandtech.com/show/14579/all-ryzen-qa-with-amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/LisaIan_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Group Interview with Dr. Lisa Su at Computex 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new hardware is also breaking new records for enthusiast CPU TDP values, as well as representing new ground on the latest 7nm process technology now available to the wider market. Details about pricing, TDP, AMD’s strategy, AMD’s performance numbers, TRX40 chipset information, and analysis of the announcements are all inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-End Desktop? What’s That?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ryzen 9 3950X Comes Into View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As teased at E3 and seemingly every show that AMD has been to since, we’re now ready to get our hands on AMD’s top-tier consumer-grade processor. The Ryzen 9 3950X is the bigger cousin to the Ryzen 9 3900X, this time using two 8-core chiplets built on TSMC’s 7nm process with the Zen 2 microarchitecture. This is paired with the same I/O die, and overall this Ryzen 9 3950X will offer four more cores and +100 MHz on the turbo frequency over the 3900X, all at a $749 recommended retail price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-002_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ryzen 9 3950X will be compatible in the majority of AM4 motherboards, although in order to take advantage of the 24 PCIe 4.0 lanes on the CPU, an X570 motherboard is recommended. The 16 cores offer a 3.5 GHz base frequency and a 4.7 GHz single core boost frequency; the overall all-core turbo frequency will be dependent on the motherboard used, the quality of the silicon, and the turbo in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 105W TDP matches that of the 12-core part, and it should be noted that the 3950X will not come with an in-the-box cooler. Instead, AMD argues that customers looking at this price range of CPU typically go out and purchase their own, something better than the 125 W Wraith Prism that AMD might have put in the box. To that end AMD is going to publish a list of recommended cooling solutions that are pre-validated by AMD on the website, which should be live on today (the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-008.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-008_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding BIOS and AGESA versions on motherboards: AMD has stated that AGESA 1.0.0.4B (also known as 1.0.0.4 Patch B) is going to be required in order to enable full performance on the Ryzen 9 3950X. AMD stated that this AGESA version actually unites several different groups of Ryzen CPUs under the same numbering scheme, to make it easier to manage. It is worth noting that when quizzed, AMD acknowledged that some motherboard manufacturers were putting out ‘beta’ versions of 1.0.0.4B, rather than the full release, and they recommend that users should wait for a full 1.0.0.4B version for their motherboard (even though some motherboard manufacturers aren’t exactly being clear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-007.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-007_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance, AMD claims a +22% single thread performance jump for the 3950X over the 2700X, in 1080p gaming the company claims it goes toe-to-toe against the Core i9-9900K and trounces the Core i9-9920X (a $1200 CPU), and in content creation it surpasses both the 9900K and 9920X by 18-79% in selected tests. The company also states that a 16-core 3950X uses less wall power than an 8-core 9900K system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Intel cutting its upcoming Cascade Lake-X HEDT processor line in half (and conveniently not releasing a 16-core part), the field does get a little more competitive for anyone looking at building a holiday system. What is important to note here is that AMD is shifting the line between consumer and high-end desktop higher: users spending $749 on a CPU get a ton of cores, but if they need more PCIe lanes, they have to go even higher to get the latest and greatest (see 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Threadripper below). On a different note, AMD did state that Intel’s recent price adjustments had no effect on its product plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side announcement from AMD, regarding all of the Ryzen 3000 hardware, is that every CPU now supports a cTDP down mode through the Ryzen Master software. With the tool, users can select the next power range down from the TDP of the processor. This means that 95W/105W CPUs can be set to run at 65W, then the 65W CPUs can be set to run at 45W, and the 45W CPUs can run at 35W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-011.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-011_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is doing this because they have seen a number of customers request high-core count processors at lower TDP values. Rather than releasing a wide array of X and non-X parts to satisfy all different areas of the market, AMD is offering this ‘cTDP down-like’ option for system builders that do want to focus on something like a 65W 16-core processor for their system. This isn’t to say that AMD will not release non-X CPUs in the future (they’re typically cheaper than the X CPUs), but rather than have customers wait for those parts to enter the market, AMD is giving this option to speed up adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Ryzen Threadripper, Up to 32-Cores&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the product a lot of users have been waiting for. Ever since AMD introduced the world to its Rome processors, with up to 64 cores based on 7nm chiplets and the Zen 2 microarchitecture, rumors have been swirling about what exactly the corresponding Threadripper platform will bring. We now have the answers to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/box2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/box2_575px.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LisaSu/status/1192441604637749248&quot;&gt;From CEO Dr. Lisa Su's Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two processors that AMD will be initially launching in the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Generation Ryzen Threadripper family are the TR 3960X and the TR 3970X. These are 24-core and 32-core parts respectively, built using four chiplets and one IO die in a Rome-sized package. Both CPUs will feature a 280 W TDP, and offer boost frequencies up to 4.5 GHz.&lt;/p&gt;

To put that in perspective, it wasn’t too long ago that for that money you would only get 10 cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 24-core TR 3960X offers almost the same, but trades a few cores for a 3.8 GHz base frequency and will retail for $1399. The competition for this part is likely to be the Core i9-10980XE, which has 18-cores and has a tray price of $979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-017.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-017_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CPUs have 128 MB of L3 cache, due to the use of four chiplets. We asked AMD if these CPUs have 4 chiplets inside the package and 4 dummy ones, like the dummy silicon in previous Threadripper products – AMD confirmed that there will only be four chiplets in each package. This means that each CPU will be in a symmetrical 6+6+6+6 or 8+8+8+8 configuration, minimizing the total amount of silicon AMD has to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each CPU supports four channels of DDR4-3200. We confirmed that this included support for ECC UDIMMs on a board-by-board basis, but does not include RDIMM or LRDIMM support. AMD did state that these new CPUs are validated for the 32 GB DDR4 modules coming onto the market, which makes a realistic maximum DRAM support of 256GB (8 x 32GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For performance, AMD gave us some numbers comparing each CPU to the 18-core Core i9-9980XE from Intel. In common workstation tasks, such as program compilation, Adobe Premier transcoding, and rendering, AMD is quoting a +22-31% performance gain for the 24-core part, and a +36-49% uplift for the 32-core part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we asked AMD about AI performance, they stated that while AI is an emerging workload in the enterprise space, for the workstation market these products are targeting exactly what their customers are requesting today: ‘Threadripper and Zen 2 have been taken by customers looking at content creation, CAD, and code work/compilation. AI is still an emerging vertical in the workstation at this time.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/CPU1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/CPU1_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to previous generation Threadripper parts, the new 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Ryzen Threadripper features a central I/O die in the hardware which all the chiplets are connected to. This I/O die has all the PCIe lanes and the DRAM channels, which means that the memory latency issues with the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Generation Threadripper should no longer be present with the new chips. Both chips launched here have 64 PCIe 4.0 lanes, which are split into 48x general purpose lanes, 8 lanes for the CPU-to-chipset communications, and 8 lanes for I/O. This means that users can have the following CPU configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; root complex: x16 or x8/x8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; root complex: x16 or x8/x8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; root complex: x16 or x8/x8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chipset downlink: x8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one: PCIe 4.0 x4 slot, 1 x NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4, 4x SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one: PCIe 4.0 x4 slot, 1 x NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4, 4x SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously things like SATA ports can also come off the chipset. We discuss the new chipset on the next page. But one thing to note here is the CPU-to-chipset connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AMD Ryzen on most AM4 chipsets, for first generation and second generation Threadripper, and for every Intel platform in recent memory, the connection between the CPU and the chipset has been the equivalent of a PCIe 3.0 x4 link. This link, as the industry has progressed into the world of NVMe storage, has become a bottleneck for any user wishing to push a modern PCIe-based storage drive along with anything else on the same uplink. AMD increased it for the X570 motherboard generation to PCIe 4.0 x4 for mainstream, doubling the bandwidth from its closest competitor, but what AMD is doing with the new 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Threadripper is increasing that link bandwidth by a factor of two again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this CPU, and the TRX40 chipset, users now have a PCIe 4.0 x8 link between the CPU and the chipset. This is the equivalent of a PCIe 3.0 x16 link, or a previous generation full GPU slot. It means that users could, if they wanted, push four times as much data up and down that link. To be honest, this sort of thing should have happened a while go on the Intel side of the equation, so I’m glad that AMD is pushing the boundaries here. It’s also one reason for 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Gen Threadripper having a new socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/75642432_954312474949611_7774957581147045888_o2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/75642432_954312474949611_7774957581147045888_o2_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/AorusTW/photos/a.140069413040592/954312471616278/?type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;From GIGABYTE's Aorus Facebook Page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that correctly: the new Threadripper requires a new socket. Because of the new CPU-to-chipset link, as well as a few ‘forward looking adjustments and scalability’, we now have what AMD are calling an sTRX4 socket and related TRX40 motherboards. AMD wasn’t prepared to make a statement on the record about committing to this socket long term, but stated that adjustments were made to ensure the future longevity of the platform, so one could infer at least one more generation on this new socket. Technically it is the same 4094 pins as the previous socket, and even the keying (the marks along the side of the processor) is the same, however AMD stated that due to this new PCIe 4.0 x8 requirement, if you put a new processor in an old motherboard (or vice versa), it just won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the motherboards, expect a few new parts to enter the market. More details on TRX40 on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But motherboards aside, I just want to point out that AMD's numbering scheme leaves some room at the top. Above the 3970X, there leaves the potential for a 3980X and 3990X. We know that these CPUs are based on the same layouts as AMD's Rome-based EPYC processors, and those are offered with 48-core and 64-core variants. We may be at a practical TDP limit of 280W, but if there's more room at the top, AMD might take it. At this point, AMD has said that they are only announcing two SKUs today and declined to answer the question of whether any more are coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4x3200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;280 W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1399&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TRX40: More High-End Motherboards for TR3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new sTRX4 socket will be paired with a TRX40 chipset – a design that AMD says comes from an in-house team and built on GlobalFoundries 14nm. The new chipset, updated from the previous X399 in this space and even updated from the X570 in the consumer space, is the other half in the CPU-to-chipset bandwidth story.  By using a PCIe 4.0 x8 link, AMD is removing almost any practical bandwidth limitation downstream from the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new TRX40 chipset will come with a degree of modularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/Chipset.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/Chipset_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the chipset, we can see motherboard manufacturers afforded a full PCIe 4.0 x8 slot, up to another x8 lanes as two x4 connections or further bifurcated, or instead of those bifurcated lanes, either four or eight more SATA ports. That’s 8 SATA ports on top of the four already present on the chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I like these modular systems. It allows motherboard manufacturers to go crazy with offering potential systems. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tgrey&quot;&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Potential TRX40 Variants&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;tlblue&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;CPU&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Chipset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;TRX40 SATA Powerhouse&lt;br/&gt;20 drives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x48 for PCIe slots&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x8 for downlink&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8x SATA from options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x8 for dual NVMe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8x SATA from options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4x SATA from chipset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;TRX40 NVMe&lt;br/&gt;Powerhouse&lt;br/&gt;18+ drives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x48 for PCIe slots&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x8 for downlink&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;dual NVMe from options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;x8 for dual NVMe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;dual NVMe for options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that would be a motherboard with x16/x16/x16 (or x16/x8/x16/x8) in terms of PCIe 4.0 slots, a single x8 slot for a pair of NVMe drives, and then TWENTY SATA ports, all directly supported on the system without any additional controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SATA isn’t your thing, then the same arguments could be made for 48 PCIe lanes and six PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe slots, making a total of 18 high capacity PCIe 4.0 drives. The fact that AMD has put more PCIe lanes into their high end desktop platforms, plus this amount of modularity, wants me to play Dr. Frankenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/74332017_954309738283218_2280574694409109504_o.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/74332017_954309738283218_2280574694409109504_o_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, those ideas are a bit extreme. Motherboard manufacturers will likely have to partition off a few lanes for 10 GbE networking, perhaps Thunderbolt, or maybe something more exotic like a RAID controller, or an RGB controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in some of our previous news posts, motherboard manufacturers have been slowly leaking names of their TRX40 products. At this point in time we have seen mentions of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ASRock TRX40 Creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASRock TRX40 Taichi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIGABYTE TRX40 AORUS XTREME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASUS Prime TRX40 Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSI TRX40 Creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSI TRX40 Pro 10G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSI TRX40 Pro Wi-Fi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect details of some of these to perhaps be announced today, or on the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; when the CPUs come to market. GIGABYTE has even been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AorusOfficial/status/1191173273377280000&quot;&gt;showing previews of their motherboards on social media&lt;/a&gt;, with one showing an obscene number of power phases, and we’ve seen images of boards with 8 SATA ports. We’ll have our usual motherboard overview article up on that date, and we’ll be looking at reviews of these motherboards through the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/73415963_954309764949882_1934281187958718464_o.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/73415963_954309764949882_1934281187958718464_o_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will address comments about potential TRX80/WRX80 motherboards which have been put into the ether as potential other chipsets being launched. When asked, AMD said that the only chipset they are launching today is TRX40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMD Athlon 3000G: Aligning Names and Numbers at $49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd-one out from today’s announcement is a processor at the other end of the portfolio. To put it into context, if a user wants to jump on board the 7nm and Zen 2 bandwagon, the entry price point is $199 for the Ryzen 5 3600. Below that we have older hardware based on Zen 1, and AMD’s APU line of processors featuring integrated graphics. The new Athlon 3000G sits firmly in this category, and aims to be a very interesting processor indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Athlon 3000G is a 35W dual core Zen+ processor with 3 compute units of Vega graphics, built on 12nm and falls in the Picasso family of hardware. It doesn’t have any turbo, but does have a nominal frequency of 3.5 GHz on the CPU and 1100 MHz on the GPU. Supported memory speeds are DDR4-2933 and it can support up to 64 GB. It will come bundled with AMD’s 65W near-silent stock cooler, which is absolutely overkill for this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-012.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15062/AMD%20Fall%20Desktop%20Announcement%20Briefing%20Deck-page-012_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dual core Zen+ Picasso APU sounds familiar, it’s because AMD already has a processor that fits the bill: the AMD Athlon 300GE. Following previous convention, I would have expected AMD to call this new processor the 320GE, as it has +100 MHz more on the CPU. However, AMD are changing the naming for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to align it more with the Ryzen family. With the Ryzen 3000 series starting with the Ryzen 3 3200G for the 65W Zen+ APUs, moving into the Ryzen 5 3600 for the 65 W desktop Zen 2 CPUs, each of these are four digits plus a letter. By moving to 3000G, it allows AMD to equate the two families together (even if there’s still an APU/desktop CPU microarchitecture mismatch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;35 W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tlgrey&quot;&gt;Athlon 200GE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 / 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35 W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other aspect is that the Athlon 3000G is also unlocked. AMD touts the 3000G as the first AM4 Athlon that is fully unlocked for overclocking, allowing users to adjust the CPU multiplier as high as their dreams desire (or to the limits of the silicon). As AMD is pairing the CPU with its 65W cooler, that means a lot of users, as long as the motherboard supports overclocking, should be able to push their CPU a bit higher. AMD stated that the +400 MHz in the slide deck for our briefing would represent a ‘typical’ overclock for an end-user, but then clarified they did use a high-end cooler to achieve that value. Nonetheless, an unlocked $49 chip with a cooler than can handle double the TDP could be exciting for users wanting to test their overclocking skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other feather in AMD’s cap for this new chip is that it competes against Intel’s Celeron and Pentium desktop processors. Given the high demand for Intel's high-end 14nm products, the Pentium and Celeron parts have been available in relatively low in volumes as they don’t make as much money, especially when high-end demand is high. In that instance, AMD has the advantage as the company stated that there will be plenty of Athlon silicon to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thousands of Facebook internal documents and emails published online</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-internal-documents-executive-emails-published-six4three-court-leak-2019-11</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-internal-documents-executive-emails-published-six4three-court-leak-2019-11</guid>
<description>&lt;ul class=&quot;summary-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of pages of internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; documents were published on Wednesday, shedding new light on how the company profited from user data and grappled with rivals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The documents were collected as part of a lawsuit involving Facebook and a developer it took action against, and subsequently leaked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook has fought vigorously against the release of the documents, arguing that they presented an unbalanced picture of the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the key details you need to know about the unprecedented leak.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet&quot;&gt;Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explosive trove of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataviz.nbcnews.com/projects/20191104-facebook-leaked-documents/assets/facebook-sealed-exhibits.pdf&quot;&gt;nearly 4,000 pages of confidential internal Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; has been made public, shedding unprecedented light on the inner workings of the Silicon Valley social-networking giant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the investigative reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duncancampbell.org/facebookleaks&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell&lt;/a&gt; released a vast swathe of internal emails, reports, and other sensitive documents from the early 2010s that detail Facebook's internal approach to privacy and how it worked with app developers and handled their access to user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents were originally compiled as part of a lawsuit that the startup Six4Three brought against Facebook for cutting off its bikini-photo app's access to the developer platform. The documents were supposed to remain under seal — but they were leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the documents had already been made public before Wednesday. The British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-documents-six4three-case-published-british-parliament-2018-12&quot;&gt;published hundreds of pages in a report in December&lt;/a&gt;; they were seized from Six4Three's founder, Ted Kramer, when he visited the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the months before he put the entire trove of documents into the public domain, Campbell shared them with journalists at NBC News and other outlets, who then published several stories about them. (Campbell said that he was sent the documents in February, the same day that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/&quot;&gt;committee published its final report&lt;/a&gt;, and that the sender was anonymous.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facebook has fought vigorously against the release of the documents, arguing that they do not paint a balanced picture of its activities. In an emailed statement, a company representative told Business Insider: &quot;These old documents have been taken out of context by someone with an agenda against Facebook, and have been distributed publicly with a total disregard for US law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Insider is combing through the documents and will update this story with our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key revelations from the document dump, including from reports published from earlier leaks:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The leak includes nearly 4,000 pages of internal Facebook documents, nearly 3,000 pages of other exhibits from the case, and hundreds of pages of other pieces of legal documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Being a good guy boss left me £1.2m in debt</title>

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Murray Menzies paid into the pension scheme even when it was not compulsory&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;For decades plumbing firm boss Murray Menzies paid into a pension scheme for his workers at a time when it was not compulsory. But a series of complex changes to the law mean the 71-year-old is now being pursued for a huge &quot;pension debt&quot; to cover a shortfall in the shared fund he used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with a phone call from the man at the pension fund. Murray Menzies owed them money. £1,198,300 to be precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought he was joking,&quot; recalls the semi-retired plumber from Inverness. &quot;After a little while, when I realised he was being quite serious, I just thought it can't be - it can't possibly be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Menzies, whose case was recently highlighted by&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17960800.retired-plumber-fears-financial-ruin-1-2m-pension-scheme-debt/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt; The Herald newspaper,&lt;/a&gt; has no way of paying the money -  selling his home and everything he owns would only cover a fraction of his &quot;debt&quot; to the pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes his sense of injustice sharper is that his only crime was trying to be a good employer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quote-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;icon-quote&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We were the good guys - paying for a pension when it wasn't law&lt;footer&gt;Murray Menzies&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1975, when he offered his small team of plumbers a workplace pension, there was no legal obligation to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His handful of workers were signed up to the Edinburgh-based Plumbing Pensions scheme, one of the few schemes in the UK to be multi-employer, meaning it could be accessed by different, unconnected, employers and their employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, Mr Menzies paid a monthly employers' contribution, typically about £1,000. Then, four years ago, he decided to retire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't employ anybody anymore. I was very happy in 2015 when I wrote my last pension cheque,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought 'great, another thing out of the way' Then all of a sudden I got this letter saying I had triggered Section 75. I had no idea what they were talking about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's not alone. Some 560 employers across the UK who joined the Plumbing Pensions scheme are facing similar liabilities, many of them former small business owners who have no means of paying it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were the good guys - paying for a pension when it wasn't law,&quot; says Mr Menzies. &quot;Talk about something coming back and biting you on the bum.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What is Section 75 debt and why is this happening?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Robert Maxwell's pension scandal and the actions of Maersk led to tighter pension regulations
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 75 came about as a result of a sweeping review of pension regulation in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the media tycoon's death it emerged he had plundered millions from the Mirror Group pension scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pensions Act 1995 introduced a series of reforms including a &quot;minimum funding requirement&quot; for pension funds. It also introduced something called &quot;Section 75 pension debt&quot;, which meant if an employer &quot;departed&quot; a scheme, they could still be pursued for any shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, this wasn't a problem for Plumbing Pensions, a well-respected multi-employer scheme that was recommended by trade associations and unions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimum funding requirement was fairly relaxed and Plumbing Pensions was judged to be fully-funded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a few years later a pensions crisis involving Danish shipping giant Maersk prompted another shake-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2005 far more stringent rules have been in force - and, by this new yardstick, Plumbing Pensions was deemed to be under-funded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant the Section 75 debt law kicked in and under the rules anyone who &quot;departed the scheme&quot; found themselves liable for a share of the &quot;shortfall&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because it was a &quot;last man standing scheme&quot;, those still in it had to pick up the liabilities of those who had already left -  even though they had no connection with those businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;idt2&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-idt-uuid=&quot;a5bf4519-411b-4827-bcad-de421bdd816d&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-graphicuuid=&quot;a5bf4519-411b-4827-bcad-de421bdd816d&quot; class=&quot;PicContainer-iky41v-0 dkfFzK&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-graphicpic=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;Img__PicImage-s1jp862x-1 dtAYqF&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/idt2/assets/44be8f23-035e-449a-94a9-6007bf099ca9&quot; alt=&quot;plumbing tools&quot; class=&quot;Img__Image-s1jp862x-0 lmLsXj&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-graphictext=&quot;true&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;TextContainer-s1h09wvt-0 bTxczK&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Title-s5nqr84-0 vrMTP&quot;&gt;How many are affected?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Source__SourceText-s1mlfx3o-0 cjWJHv&quot;&gt;Source: Plumbing Pensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the hardest hit are small traders who ran &quot;unincorporated businesses&quot; - people like Mr Menzies - who had no idea that simply by retiring they would trigger enormous financial liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this group, without a change in the law, there's a real chance they could lose the roof over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other firms, there are some options available for delaying the payments - known as &quot;easements&quot; - but there are other costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Young from Seamill in North Ayrshire, is unable to pass on his firm to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm 70 at the moment.

The only option I have is to run it into the ground in a reasonably orderly fashion when I plan to retire because it's worthless,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a complete liability. There is no-one who would entertain buying what is and has always been a good, profitable local business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fraser Lawrence, who runs a small plumbing business in Perthshire, is another small businessman caught in the trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The business has been left totally worthless, so if I want to retire, we just have to fold up,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No-one is going to buy the business because they wouldn't want to take on the debt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some employers another worry is that if they die (and some are now quite elderly) the liability remains - and a claim could be made on their estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Why didn't they tell us sooner? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony in all of this is that Plumbing Pensions is not short of assets. According to recent valuations, there's more than enough money in the fund to cover all its liabilities on an ongoing basis. In short, it doesn't need the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;shortfall&quot; is a hypothetical one - only existing because the Section 75 rule uses a particularly expensive method of calculating the costs should the scheme ever decide to wind up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief executive of Plumbing Pensions, Kate Yates, said these were unfair &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of a well-meaning change in the law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without another law change, she said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Kate Yates from Plumbing Pensions said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's nothing the scheme can do. The scheme is in a really difficult position,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We recognise that the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are staggering and in some cases completely unaffordable - but if it doesn't issue these debt notices, it faces financial penalties that could put the members' benefits at risk.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a question that many of those affected are asking is why weren't they told sooner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2007 to 2009 there was a brief period when the law allowed members to get out of the scheme by paying as little as £1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those now facing huge bills say they were kept in the dark about this - and are only now learning about their &quot;debt&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumbing Pensions said that was partly down to the complexity of gathering data from thousands of individual employers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also spent many years lobbying for an exemption from the law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When this law came in, it was recognised it didn't work for the plumbing scheme and it would have terrible consequences for these employers,&quot; Ms Yates added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So much time has been spent talking to government officials seeking ways to help the employers, while being fair to the members of the scheme.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Glimmer of hope 'scuppered by Brexit'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock in the last parliament, knows at first hand the impact this is having on small businesses. A local firm employing 20 people was forced to close because it had become unsellable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SNP politician introduced a private members bill last year, with cross-party support, which would have given these employers some protection - but amid the recent political turmoil, it has run into the sand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His frustration is shared by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (Snipef) which for years actively encouraged its members to sign up with Plumbing Pensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snipef chief executive Fiona Hodgson has been lobbying for a law change - but she's faced three changes of UK Pension Secretary in three years and with so much else going on politically, the chances of it being resolved any time soon appear slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've been doing our utmost to get something done about this but Brexit has scuppered it,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the rules were in place to ensure schemes were adequately funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: &quot;We have a duty to protect members in their retirement, ensure schemes are properly funded and work with those employers who remain in a multi-employer scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've introduced greater flexibility to help employers manage their debts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a political solution, the small businesses caught up in this are left in limbo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've sat in my office here crying,&quot; said Mr Dorwood. &quot;I've spent two-and-a-half years not sleeping at night, sitting in here at four in the morning trying to find a solution. For a 51-year-old father-of-two who's built a successful business it's a disgrace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All I've done is try to be a good employer,&quot; said Mr Menzies. &quot;I just try to carry on and hope that common sense will prevail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>You can fool some of the people, all of the time</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;N 2001 JONATHAN HAIDT&lt;/small&gt;, a psychologist at New York University, published a paper in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/em&gt; delightfully entitled “The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail”. He argued that when people make moral decisions, they are influenced by emotion, or what might also be termed intuition. They may think they are weighing evidence but in fact their decisions are made in the blink of an eye. The reasons they give afterwards merely reflect these emotions, like a dog wagging its tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have taken similar views. “Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions,” wrote David Hume, a philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment, in 1739. But the lessons of Mr Haidt’s essay are particularly apt at a time when lying has come to define politics more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictatorships have always been built on lies: that Kim Jong Un is a demigod, that nothing much happened on June 4th 1989 in Tiananmen Square. The Soviet Union called its main newspaper &lt;em&gt;Pravda&lt;/em&gt; (“Truth”). That was a lie, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians in democracies have always mangled the truth: denying affairs and downplaying the ill effects of their policies. What is new is the degree to which voters are prepared to back leaders who seem to revel in their mendacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misleaders of the free world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson’s first notable act was to be fired from a newspaper for making up a quote. Yet he is Britain’s prime minister. India said that it had downed a Pakistani &lt;small&gt;F&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;-16&lt;/small&gt; fighter jet over Kashmir in February. Facing an election, Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, said his country had taught Pakistan a lesson. A subsequent inspection of Pakistan’s aircraft by American officials showed that none was missing (India maintained its position).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for President Donald Trump, whole websites are devoted to his truthlessness. On one, Glenn Kessler of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; fact-checks presidential statements and awards scores: three Pinocchios for “significant factual errors” and four for “whoppers” (Mr Trump’s claims about Ukraine and Hunter Biden fit into the whopper category). As of October 9th, the president had made 13,435 false or misleading statements while in office. Rather than grapple with what is true and what is false, Twitter said on October 30th it would ban political ads (Facebook has so far declined to the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet their duplicity seems to cost politicians little, if anything, in electoral support. Surveys by YouGov, a pollster, put Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party in the lead in the election due in December. Mr Trump’s job-approval rating, at 43%, is low but only one point below what it was when he took office. No one takes for granted that he will lose next year’s presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn’t lying more damaging? One possibility is that lying on a Trumpian scale is so unusual—so frequent, shameless and easily falsified—that people do not know how to react. In tests, between two-thirds and three-quarters of people say they never lie; most of the rest claim to lie fewer than five times a day. It is hard to comprehend someone who goes so far beyond normal, occasional deceitfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another explanation is that people trust leaders for whom they have voted, whatever those people say. A recent study by two researchers at Brigham Young University, Michael Barber and Jeremy Pope, examined whether voters are loyal to an individual leader or whether they support leaders who represent the policies and outlook they themselves espouse. Because Mr Trump has abandoned so many traditional Republican policies, such as support for free trade and suspicion of Russia, the researchers concluded that it is personal: those who still call themselves Republicans support Mr Trump because of who he is, not what he stands for. And if personal loyalty trumps ideology, then voters may back a politician even if he does not tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Mr Trump’s supporters may even relish his deceits. If you believe that all politicians are liars, those outraged by Mr Trump’s falsehoods are hypocrites. The ire of his opponents and members of the press, such as Mr Kessler, at his lies is taken chiefly as evidence of his cocking a snook at the swampy establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in daily life, without the particular pressures of politics, people find it hard to spot liars. Tim Levine of the University of Alabama, Birmingham, has spent decades running tests that allow participants (apparently unobserved) to cheat. He then asks them on camera if they have played fair. He asks others to look at the recordings and decide who is being forthright about cheating and who is covering it up. In 300 such tests people got it wrong about half of the time, no better than a random coin toss. Few people can detect a liar. Even those whose job is to conduct interviews to dig out hidden truths, such as police officers or intelligence agents, are no better than ordinary folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution may explain credulity. In a forthcoming book, “Duped”, Mr Levine argues that evolutionary pressures have adapted people to assume that others are telling the truth. Most communication by most people is truthful most of the time, so a presumption of honesty is usually justified and is necessary to keep communication efficient. If you checked everything you were told from first principles, it would become impossible to talk. Humans are hard-wired to assume that what they hear is true—and therefore, says Mr Levine, “hard-wired to be duped”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So strong is that instinct that people suspend their critical faculties when given orders by a superior. The point was made by one of the most famous experiments in psychology, the “obedience to authority” test conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1961. Subjects were (falsely) told that they were taking part in a test that required them to administer electric shocks to another participant (who was an actor). As the test proceeded, they were willing to give shocks so large that the impact would have been fatal had they been real. The normal interpretation is that people are willing to behave unconscionably if they can tell themselves they were merely “following orders”. But Mr Levine raises another possibility: they may well have had doubts that the experiment was real, but not sufficient to override what he calls the “truth default”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake news may be exacerbating people’s inbuilt gullibility. A study published last year in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, a journal, concluded that “falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth” and that this effect was especially strong for fake political news. Fake news provides voters with a smorgasbord of facts and lies from which to pick and choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In politics, however, these explanations cannot be the whole story. At the heart of the lying-politician paradox is an uncomfortable fact: voters appear to support liars more than they believe them. Mr Trump’s approval rating is 11 points higher than the share of people who trust him to tell the truth. A third of British voters view Mr Johnson favourably but only a fifth think he is honest. Voters believe in their leaders even if they do not believe them. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer starts with the primacy of intuitive decision-making. ln 2004 Drew Westen of Emory University in Atlanta put partisan Republicans and Democrats into a magnetic-resonance-imaging scanner and found that lying or hypocrisy by the other side lit up areas of the brain associated with rewards; lies by their own side lit up areas associated with dislike and negative emotions. At no point did the parts of the brain associated with reason show any response at all. If voters’ judgments are rooted in emotion and intuition, facts and evidence are likely to be secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important consequence of the domination of intuition is the pervasiveness of confirmation bias—the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms what you already think. It is a feature of reasoning, not a bug. There are few better illustrations than Americans’ newsgathering habits. To oversimplify, Democrats read the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;; Republicans watch Fox News. A Pew poll in 2018 found that 82% of Democrats thought the media perform a useful “watchdog” role of keeping politicians from doing things they shouldn’t. Only 38% of Republicans agreed. By contrast, five years earlier, when Barack Obama was president, the figures were 67% and 69% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new version of confirmation bias is “identity-protective cognition”, argues Dan Kahan of Yale Law School. This says that people process information in a way that protects their self-image and the image they think others have of them. For example, those who live surrounded by climate-change sceptics may avoid saying anything that suggests humankind is altering the climate, simply to avoid becoming an outcast. A climate sceptic encircled by members of Extinction Rebellion might do the same thing in reverse. As people become more partisan, more issues are being taken as markers of the kind of person you are: in Britain, the country’s membership of the European Union; in America, guns, trade, even American football. All give rise to the acceptance of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deceit of power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Gilovich of Cornell shows how fake news, cognition bias and assuming that people are telling the truth interact to make it easier to believe lies. If you want to believe a thing, he argues (that is, a lie that supports your preconceived ideas), you ask yourself: “&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; I believe it?” A single study or comment online is usually enough to give you permission to hold this belief, even if it is bogus. But if you do not want to believe something (because it contradicts your settled opinions) you are more likely to ask: “&lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; I believe it?” Then, one apparently reputable statement on the other side will satisfy you. That may be why so many climate sceptics manage to cling to their beliefs in the teeth of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Activists point out that 99% of scientists believe the Earth is warming up because of human actions. But people who doubt the reality of climate change listen to the other 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side. Brainboxes are as likely as anyone else to ignore facts which support their foes. John Maynard Keynes, a (famously intelligent) British economist, is said to have asked someone: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” If they were honest, most would reply: “I stick to my guns.” &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I was an astrologer</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The man was agitated, with red-rimmed eyes and clammy skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Help me,” he said. “I’m under a curse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it was just flickering lights, he said. And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more – and it was happening more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw a Catholic priest,” said the man. “But he couldn’t help. Can you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney’s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and divine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I’d devoured a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1228113.Positive_Magic&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Positive Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break. She picked the card for pregnancy, which we laughed about, because she wanted her tubes tied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later she said, “Guess what the doctor told me this morning?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was pregnant, and I was officially psychic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding to develop my gift, I enrolled in a psychic class, where I learned to say the first thing that popped into my head. “Your first thoughts are the most psychic ones, before your rational mind interferes,” said the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that all things are connected, and everything is a symbol of something else. Suddenly, I saw signs and omens everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;‘The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change.’&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311b8a208651345efc9f555acca927cd78185da3/166_0_4980_2988/master/4980.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8a5d1c14a08494f1743caf8f1474b2da&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test my new skills, I volunteered to be a clairvoyant at the spiritualist church. Congregants would place a flower on the table, and the clairvoyants would choose one and “read” it at the microphone. Nervous, the first thing I grabbed was a packet of silver foil. The rose inside had been packed so tightly, its petals were crushed. I didn’t get a single vibe from it, so I just described the symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are feeling battered and bruised,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, a woman approached and said she was a victim of domestic violence, and what should she do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only 19 and had no idea, but my psychic reputation soared. The attention was intoxicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the universe told me I wasn’t cut out for science, by sending me my second-year results. I dropped out to pursue theatre and also signed up for a one-year course at the Sydney Astrology Centre, a cavernous commercial building in a seedy part of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course began with the meanings of the zodiac, from Aries to Aquarius. Then the luminaries; the sun (what you will become), the moon (what you brought into this life) and planets. After that, how to calculate planetary positions and cast horoscopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although astrologers use Nasa data for their calculations, horoscopes aren’t a true map of the heavens. The Babylonians who invented astrology believed the sun rotated round the Earth; modern astrologers still use Earth-centred charts, as if Copernicus had never existed. That’s only the start of the scientific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;With prospects in the gutter, who can blame millennials for turning to the stars? | Nell Frizzell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astrological meanings themselves derive from a principle called sympathetic magic, where things that look alike are linked together. Mars looks red, so it rules red things like blood. How do you get blood? You cut, so Mars rules surgery and war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You forecast by combining meanings with planetary movements. Say Saturn, planet of restrictions, is about to transit the First House of self – your life will contract! You’re going to get more responsibilities than usual. Or maybe you’ll be denied the chance to take on more responsibilities. Or maybe a cold, critical person will come into your life. But anyway, it’s a good time to go on a diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrology is one big word association game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved it, though I was losing interest in other mystical practices. Partly I didn’t have time, because I was now immersed in theatre while working as a temp typist at St Vincent’s, a Catholic hospital. But as I bounced from one department to another, my views changed. I’d understood organised religion to be something between an embarrassment and an evil. Yet as Aids did its dreadful work – this was the 1990s – I watched nuns offer compassionate care to the dying. Christian volunteers checked on derelict men with vomit down their clothes. I became uncomfortably aware that New Agers do not build hospitals or feed alcoholics – they buy self-actualisation at the cash register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was accepted into a music degree and my days filled with classes, my nights with rehearsals. This caused a cash crisis, because I could only do office work during academic holidays. When I saw the ad for a fortune teller, I pounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My credentials impressed the man on the counter (“My name is Ron,” he said. “My spirit guide is Blue Star. He’s on the intergalactic committee”) and I was hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We charged A$50 an hour, a significant sum at the time, and I wanted to offer value. No fishing for clues from me – I printed a horoscope or laid the cards and started interpreting immediately, intending to dazzle the customer with my insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half the time, though, I couldn’t get a word in. It turned out what most people want is the chance to unload for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change. I heard these stories so often I could often guess what the problem was the moment someone walked in. Heartbroken young men, for example, talk about it to psychics, because it’s less risky than telling their friends. Sometimes I’d mischievously say, “Let her go. She’s not worth it,” as soon as one arrived. Once I heard, “Oh my God, oh my GOD!” as an amazed guy fell backwards down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that intelligence and education do not protect against superstition. Many customers were stockbrokers, advertising executives or politicians, dealing with issues whose outcomes couldn’t be controlled. It’s uncertainty that drives people into woo, not stupidity, so I’m not surprised millennials are into astrology. They grew up with Harry Potter and graduated into a precarious economy, making them the ideal customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;‘Intelligence and education do not protect against superstition.’&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72cb92135220ae359755cc3365f8de1f742ae70/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=1749589395ae52afcd85a33e8c9fa213&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What broke the spell for me was, oddly, people swearing by my gift. Some repeat customers claimed I’d made very specific predictions, of a kind I never made. It dawned on me that my readings were a co-creation – I would weave a story and, later, the customer’s memory would add new elements. I got to test this theory after a friend raved about a reading she’d had, full of astonishingly accurate predictions. She had a tape of the session, so I asked her to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clairvoyant had said none of the things my friend claimed. Not a single one. My friend’s imagination had done all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet sometimes I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be uncannily accurate – wasn’t that proof I was psychic? One Sunday, I went straight from work to a party, before I’d had time to shuck off my psychic persona. A student there mentioned she wasn’t sure what to specialize in – photography, graphic design or maybe industrial design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do photography,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at me, wide-eyed. “How did you know?” she said, explaining photography was her real love, but her parents didn’t approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t say, “because my third eye is open”, so I reflected for a moment. Then it hit me. “You sounded happier when you said ‘photography’,” I said. My psychic teacher was right – the signals we pick up before conscious awareness kicks in can be accurate and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;I don’t even believe in astrology, so why am I addicted to this horoscope app? | Stephanie Convery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe I wasn’t psychic, but it didn’t matter. It was just entertainment, after all, until the cursed man came in. The one who’d seen the Catholic priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get to a doctor,” I told him. “Now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very week, I’d typed letters for a neurologist who specialized in brain diseases. Some of those letters had documented strikingly similar symptoms to this man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you saying I’m crazy?” he said, his hands balled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I reassured him. “But Catholic priests know what they’re doing. If he couldn’t help, this isn’t a curse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made the man angrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re a fraud!” he shouted, and stormed downstairs to demand his money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encounter shook me, badly. Shortly afterwards, I packed my astrology books and Tarot cards away for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can still make the odd forecast, though. Here’s one: the venture capital pouring into astrology apps will create a fortune telling system that works, because humans are predictable. As people follow the advice, the apps’ predictive powers will increase, creating an ever-tighter electronic leash. But they’ll be hugely popular – because if you sprinkle magic on top, you can sell people anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;FLINT, Mich. — Nakiya Wakes could not understand how her wiry, toothy-grinned 6-year-old had gone from hyperactive one school year to what teachers described as hysterical the next. Then, in 2015, the state of Michigan delivered a diagnosis of sorts: Ms. Wakes’s neighborhood’s water — which her son, Jaylon, had been drinking and bathing in for more than a year — was saturated with lead, at some of the highest levels in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jaylon would cycle through two schools, receive 30 suspensions and rack up 70 unexcused absences. In one of Ms. Wakes’s clashes with Flint Community Schools, she delivered administrators a warning: “You can’t keep suspending him because soon, you’re going to have to suspend the whole school system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/flint-water-crisis.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Five years&lt;/a&gt; after Michigan switched Flint’s water supply to the contaminated Flint River from Lake Huron, the city’s lead crisis has migrated from its homes to its schools, where neurological and behavioral problems — real or feared — among students are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/08/28/special-ed-concerns-loom-large-after-flint.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatening&lt;/a&gt; to overwhelm the education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The contamination of this long-struggling city’s water exposed nearly 30,000 schoolchildren to a neurotoxin known to have detrimental effects on children’s developing brains and nervous systems. Requests for special education or behavioral interventions began rising four years ago, when the water contamination became public, bolstering a class-action lawsuit that demanded more resources for Flint’s children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That lawsuit forced the state to establish the $3 million Neurodevelopmental Center of Excellence, which began screening students. The screenings then confirmed a range of disabilities, which have prompted still more requests for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The percentage of the city’s students who qualify for special education services has nearly doubled, to 28 percent, from 15 percent the year the lead crisis began, and the city’s screening center has received more than 1,300 referrals since December 2018. The results: About 70 percent of the students evaluated have required school accommodations for issues like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, also known as A.D.H.D.; dyslexia; or mild intellectual impairment, said Katherine Burrell, the associate director of the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have a school district where all that’s left are damaged kids who are being exposed to other damaged kids, and it’s causing more damage,” said Stephanie Pascal, who has taught in Flint for 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Medical experts say there is no way to prove that the lead has caused new disabilities. Pediatricians here caution against overdiagnosing children as irreparably brain damaged, if only to avoid stigmatizing an entire city. The State Department of Education, in battling the class-action &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://edlawcenter.org/assets/files/pdfs/D.R.%20v.%20Michigan/D_R_v_MDE_et.%20al.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lawsuit filed&lt;/a&gt; by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and the New Jersey-based Education Law Center, enlisted an expert who testified that the real public health crisis was not the lead-contaminated water but the paranoia of parents, students and teachers exposed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Dr. Burrell said that proving the cause of the students’ problems was not the point. Many of the problems uncovered by the lead testing could certainly have existed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We’re not here to prove causation,” she said. “We’re here to provide answers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And school officials said the problems would almost certainly get worse because there was no safe level of lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“What the research says is that as they get older, and the cognitive demands get harder, we will start to see the demands get higher, and the resources aren’t going to be there,” said Lisa A. Hagel, the superintendent of the Genesee Intermediate School District, the county that includes Flint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-726fd9fc&quot;&gt;A school system begins falling further behind.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Long before Flint’s water system was contaminated, its schools exemplified the struggles of urban districts — as its tax base shrank, its student population drifted to charter schools and its core public schools were left with a small but troubled and impoverished student body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the 1960s, the city enrolled nearly 50,000 students in more than 50 buildings. Today, it educates 4,500 students on 11 campuses. A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.publiccharters.org/sites/default/files/documents/2017-10/Enrollment_Share_Report_Web_0.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 report&lt;/a&gt; found that 55 percent of Flint’s students attended charter schools — the second-highest charter enrollment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the lead crisis began unfolding in 2014, the tiny school district had a $21 million budget deficit that required it to cut more than 200 staff members, including special education teachers. It was transferring millions of dollars from its operating budget to pay for special education, and in violation of federal law, it was segregating special education students from their peers for most of the school day. Flint’s teachers were and are among the lowest paid in Genesee County, though a new contract has pushed starting salaries to $35,339 a year, from $32,000 in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the 2013-2014 school year, 15.5 percent of the district’s special education students dropped out of high school, compared with 8.63 percent statewide. In 2014-2015, 13 percent of special education students in the school system were suspended or expelled for more than 10 days — more than five times the statewide rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then came the lead crisis. The class-action lawsuit, filed in 2016, accused the city, the county and the Michigan Department of Education of ignoring dismal outcomes that have worsened after Flint’s children were exposed to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The partial settlement that established the neurodevelopmental center was a “critical first step,” said Kristin Totten, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., but the lawsuit is demanding that every Flint student be assessed and get needed intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This was an unprecedented crisis that warrants an unprecedented response,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The suit accuses the school systems of violating federal and state laws, including the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, by failing to identify students who could qualify for special education services, by failing to provide the mandated instructional services to those who do qualify and by punishing children for disability-related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Students were denied assessments for education plans or behavioral intervention plans, and then were segregated from their peers, secluded and restrained, repeatedly sent home from school, expelled or arrested, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The blame for this crisis lies on the state, and instead what we’ve seen is that the children are shouldering the blame,” said Lindsay Heck, a lawyer at White &amp;amp; Case, a New York-based law firm that has worked on the case pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Flint Community Schools said in a statement that it was “deeply committed to the well-being and success of all students, and continues to add staff and enhance special education services, and to work with the Michigan Department of Education to seek ways to improve the district’s finances long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Michigan Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Genesee school district maintains it has done all it can to help identify and serve students affected by the crisis in Flint. Under the state’s education system, that district acts as an intermediary between the state and the 21 school districts in the county, including Flint, providing administrative services and dispensing special education funding from the federal government. It also operates early childhood centers and schools attended by Flint students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;School officials say that funding is disbursed equitably, but they acknowledge it is not enough. Congress promised to cover 40 percent of the cost of special education, but Washington funds only 14 to 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’d be safe to say there’s not enough allocation, much less when you have a situation like this,” said Steven Tunnicliff, the associate superintendent of the Genesee Intermediate School District, referring to the lead crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Wakes believes she lost four babies — she miscarried two sets of twins, in 2015 and in 2017 — to the water crisis, and said she is determined not to lose another. She pulled her son out of Flint Community Schools in 2017 after she said the district ignored her pleas to accommodate his A.D.H.D., which his pediatrician said was exacerbated by elevated lead levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now 10, he attends the Michigan Virtual Charter Academy, an online school, in his living room. On a recent day, he fired up his computer and made a few clicks before the screen flashed a celebratory “Assignment Complete,” then shut down abruptly. The assignments meet the requirements of a 10-year-old boy who is repeating fourth grade: They contain three- or four-letter words that he can read and they pose no more than eight questions, and then he can take a break to run outside or play his video game Fortnite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m just keeping him online until we can move the hell out of Flint,” his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6dd1a33a&quot;&gt;Flint’s teachers struggle to cope.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2016, months after the water contamination was made public, the Flint superintendent at the time, Bilal Tawwab, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fGFC_IwSm8&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told Congress&lt;/a&gt; that schools were bracing for an “evolving, educational emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We need resources to measure the intellectual and emotional damage done to each and possibly every child,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Instead, as the district’s special education rate rose by a third, the Michigan Education Department demanded more budget cuts and a salary freeze. Last school year, when one in five students qualified for special education services, one in every four special education teaching positions was unfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Bethany Dumanois, who has taught in Flint for 25 years, works two jobs to keep teaching because she said she cannot abandon children whose discolored, rash-covered skin and chunks of exposed scalp haunt her. In the earlier days of the crisis, she spent class time addressing questions from her students about whether they would die from the water like their class lizard, a bearded dragon, did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There was very minimal training in dealing with the signs and symptoms of lead poisoning,” she said. “They gave us a couple of brochures and called it a day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Teachers refer students for special education assessments, knowing the schools lack psychologists to conduct them. In small acts of defiance, they withhold their signatures from bureaucratic documents rejecting students from special education services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Dumanois said her first graders were having “extreme” reactions to insignificant issues, knocking over desks and throwing chairs. Recently, she said, three-quarters of her class could not recall five words they had gone over every day for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Instead of investing in more teachers, social workers and special education aides, she said the district had pushed laptop computers and iPads, “just jumping on any bandwagon, trying to sugarcoat what’s happening with these kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On a recent night at a local restaurant, Ms. Pascal, the 23-year Flint teaching veteran, vented over the “injustices everywhere.” The district adopted a new reading program with no money to buy the instructional materials. She had been asked to identify a handful of her students for a new behavior support program, but wants to include all 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She thinks about quitting, but said she refuses to leave another vacancy for the district to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If you were driving down the road and saw a kid walking from a car injured and bloody, do you ignore it?” she said. “That’s what I’m seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The district’s new superintendent, Derrick Lopez, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.abc12.com/content/news/Whitmer-bemoans-lack-of-progress-on-budget-with-Flint-educators-554750761.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; with a local television station that the district was in desperate need of help, pointing out that the 28 percent of students who have special education plans was double the state average. He also expressed the need to “actually pay our teachers a living wage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/house-votes-out-k-12-budget-with-additional-30-million-in-special-education-funding.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michigan Legislature’s recently passed budget&lt;/a&gt; provides a modest increase in education spending, but lawmakers rejected a proposal by the state’s new Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, to give additional funding to schools with high concentrations of special education students, like Flint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;State Representative Sheldon Neeley, Democrat of Flint, said the one-time infusion of extra money would be spread across schools in Genesee County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Instead of being delivered to us,” he said, “it’s going to be delivered around us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-33cc81b1&quot;&gt;As families flee Flint’s schools, money drains away.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Flint’s schools are now in a downward spiral. The district is funded on a per-pupil basis, but it is hemorrhaging students, about 1,000 since 2014, when the crisis began. Two-thirds of children living in Flint are in charter schools or schools run by the Genesee Intermediate School District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Angy Keelin wanted to stay in Flint Community Schools, where her blind son, Averey, was progressing in a program for visually impaired students, but then it ended abruptly. She said she was forced to follow the program 10 miles from her home to a Genesee County school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It has not gone smoothly. Last year, she requested an aide after watching her son walk into buildings and almost fall down a flight of stairs. This year, Averey, now in third grade, has been taught by a long-term substitute who cannot teach him to read Braille, as required by his federal education plan, Ms. Keelin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The year after Averey was exposed to lead, he had to repeat kindergarten, and Ms. Keelin fears a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mde/Grade_3_Reading_Facts_Families_Final_TJ_632662_7.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michigan law&lt;/a&gt; that calls for students to repeat third grade if they are more than one grade level behind in reading. “I don’t want him to be continuously held back,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jeree Brown left the Flint district in 2017, but said she still sees the effect of her son Jabari’s time at Eisenhower Elementary School. She learned Jabari had autism six months after Flint’s lead-tainted water began to flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His exposure was confirmed, along with his autism, but the school denied him an individualized education program, or I.E.P., three times, then told her that such a plan would require him to be placed in an “autism room” apart from his peers, Ms. Brown said. The plan called for him to receive speech and occupational therapy services three or four times a week, but he got them once or twice a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now 8, Jabari has transferred to a charter school and receives a wealth of autism services. He said his favorite teacher “takes me for breaks to see if you’re happy or sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some families see no way out. In Michigan, students are granted broad access to school choice, but &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mde/Revised__Schools_of_Choice_Definitions_272415_7.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;schools can reject a student for being suspended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Heather Reynolds’s 12-year-old son, Ethan, had a mood disorder and A.D.H.D. that required him to have an aide, but his short-staffed school did not supply one last spring on a day that Ethan encountered a bully in a bathroom and agreed to trade his dinosaur for the other boy’s pocketknife. The other student then reported Ethan for having the knife, and he was nearly expelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ethan, who had also tested positive for lead, told his mother he made the exchange because he “didn’t want to be punched again,” she said. This summer, after an evaluation by the neurodevelopmental center, he was given a diagnosis of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The expulsion was reversed, but the suspension went on his record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Once they get a suspension, the good schools don’t want them,” Ms. Reynolds said. “Then there’s only one school choice, which is the worst school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-150b01c4&quot;&gt;“The science of trauma and resilience.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tucked away in one of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the lead crisis is a 36,000-square-foot early childhood center that many look to for hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Educare Flint, funded largely by private money in response to the crisis, opened in December 2017 to serve 220 students ages 0 to 5 with lead exposures among the highest detected. The school is part of a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.educareschools.org/our-schools/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national network&lt;/a&gt; that uses research into early childhood education, brain development and the achievement gap between rich and poor to shape its approach. The $15 million facility includes mindfulness rooms and a generous playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For parents, the opportunity to send their children to Educare is some consolation for the outrages in their lives — like paying $100 to $200 a month for water they do not believe is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lydia Willis said her 9-month-old son was “getting so much here, including filtered water, that may not be possible at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These children keep the pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha optimistic. Though &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/pediatric-lead-exposure-presentation-from-hurley-medical-center-doctors-concerning-flint-mi/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her research&lt;/a&gt; discovered the lead in their blood in 2015, she is looking on the bright side. The crisis has forced a hard conversation about Flint — “toxicity” existed here long before the water crisis, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since the crisis, partnerships have drawn in millions of dollars to expand early childhood education and health care services, and the fallout has created a road map for other cities — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/24/nyregion/newark-lead-water-crisis.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;like Newark&lt;/a&gt; — that are on the brink of a similar crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We’re leaning on the science of trauma and resilience,” she said, “because kids across this country are waking up to the same nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
