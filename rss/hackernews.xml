<title>Boeing 737 Max pilots complained to feds for months about suspected safety flaw</title>
<link>https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2019/03/12/boeing-737-max-8-pilots-complained-feds-months-suspected-safety-flaw</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2019/03/12/boeing-737-max-8-pilots-complained-feds-months-suspected-safety-flaw</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines told &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; that it hasn't received any reports of issues with MCAS from its pilots, &quot;nor do any of our thousands of data points from the aircraft indicate any issues with MCAS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Worth-based American Airlines did not respond to questions from &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAA issued a statement to &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; Tuesday that said that it is &quot;collecting data and keeping in contact with international civil aviation authorities as information becomes available.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The FAA continuously assesses and oversees the safety performance of U.S. commercial aircraft. If we identify an issue that affects safety, the FAA will take immediate and appropriate action.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a press release Monday night: &quot;We fully support Southwest Airlines' decision to continue flying the MAX and the FAA's findings to date.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing, which posted a record $101 billion in revenue last year, issued a new statement Tuesday saying that no grounding of planes was necessary. &quot;Based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,&quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuelsen of the transport workers union said it's &quot;unconscionable&quot; that the FAA has not yet grounded the planes in the U.S., given the number of deaths that have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This pressure should not be on these pilots to overcome an engineering flaw that Boeing themselves acknowledges,&quot; said Samuelsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I check whether my flight is on a 737 Max?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have a ticket, you should be able to tell from the booking details. If you are making a booking online, many sites indicate the model. If not, websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://flightstats.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://flightstats.com&lt;/a&gt; allow you to dig into details of flights at least a few days in advance, including the make and type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;        </description>

<title>Graying Out</title>
<link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Lights-Going-Out</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Lights-Going-Out</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;For many years I’ve interacted with my fellow humans, I think perhaps more than any other way, via the medium of Internet chat. But in my chat window, they’re fading, one by one. This problem is technical and personal and I felt it ought not to go unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;inline&quot; alt=&quot;Adiumy&quot; title=&quot;Adiumy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Adiumy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since forever I’ve used a chat client called &lt;a href=&quot;https://adium.im/&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt;; it’s open-source, has a good, polished, flexible UX, and is self-updating. The people I talked to, some of them were on AIM, ICQ, on various flavors of Jabber and XMPP and then, in latter years, Google+. What’s happening is, they’re going away. The chat connections I mean, although many of those underlying services are winking out too, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That’s the Adium mascot, “Adiumy”, on the right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those to whom those terms “Jabber” and “XMPP” are new, they represented the idea that any chat service should be able to talk to any other chat service, so you could use whichever you liked best, and hang with your friends wherever on the Net they hung their chatty hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when commercial chat services supported XMPP because it was felt to be the right thing to do. But that was old-school hippie thinking, because if chatterers can just go ahead and talk to anyone anywhere, then &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; service probably won’t go viral and how are you going to monetize? You can simultaneously think markets are a useful civic tool and recognize obvious, egregious failures. So the links were severed and a whole lot of services just died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, my Adium typically listed literally hundreds of people I might choose to talk with, with a red or green “available” glyph; they were grayed-out of they weren’t signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, more and more are always grayed out, because they were on some other service that’s no longer connected. It makes me sad, because I can no longer say “Hey, qq?” when I want to. So I thought I’d cut and paste some of those people. The world being what it is, chances are there are lots that I’ll never chat with again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to tour through maybe 1% of the names in my chat window, for its own sake and to say I haven’t forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of the Adium window just now, only two people currently showing logged-in and available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Green.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Phipps and Sharpe&quot; title=&quot;Phipps and Sharpe&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Green.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshedinsights.com/&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, long time open-source maven, is an important figure in my life. In 2004, when I ejected from a failing startup and was wondering what to do, Simon reached out and said “How about coming to work for Sun? You’re interesting because you’re a blogger.” I haven’t the vaguest how my life would have turned out if he hadn’t. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucesharpe/?originalSubdomain=ca&quot;&gt;Bruce’s&lt;/a&gt; life and mine have run roughly parallel since 1973 or so; we were students at the University of Guelph; I was a little ahead and marked his papers. Then he got mixed up in technology and markup and eventually XML and hired my wife, and now we hang out together a bit in the Vancouver Electric Vehicle Association. Life is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s move into the territory of people who are still signed on, but not in chat mode. On current trends, they’ll be graying out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red1.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nottingham, O’Grady, Yugui&quot; title=&quot;Nottingham, O’Grady, Yugui&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mnot.net/&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; is a pillar of the net, has done as much as any other human to keep HTTP’s design and specification coherent over the last couple of decades. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sogrady.org/&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; is an analyst with a baseball cap, and knows really a lot about the Internet biz. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.yugui.jp/about&quot;&gt;Yugui&lt;/a&gt; I hardly know&lt;span class=&quot;dashes&quot;&gt; —&lt;/span&gt;  for a long time she was the Ruby release manager, and has her fingerprints all over the language’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red2.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gregorio, Hardt, Rohit, Markes, Meier, Mueller&quot; title=&quot;Gregorio, Hardt, Rohit, Markes, Meier, Mueller&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitworking.org/&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; is a technologist and evangelist. Dick was a long-time pillar of the Vancouver tech scene, I worked for him as a consultant once and dueled with him over hiring talent on others, now he’s a fellow Amazonian. Rohit is one of the most social humans on the planet and at one point the FoRK (Friends of) list was a force to be reckoned with in the Valley. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/07/RohitSmruti&quot;&gt;went to his wedding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kevinmarks.com/&quot;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; has fought many standards crusades, most notably microformats; a person who cares deeply about keeping the Net working. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.radioactiveyak.com/&quot;&gt;Reto&lt;/a&gt; preceded me on the Android DevRel team at Google, and taught me a whole lot about advocacy, how to do it with integrity and sanity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pythondj&quot;&gt;Diane&lt;/a&gt;, whom I’ve known along multiple axes, lives in a nice part of the world and wears a red hat these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Red3.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cooper, Enebo&quot; title=&quot;Cooper, Enebo&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danese_Cooper&quot;&gt;Danese&lt;/a&gt;, she was doing Internet advocacy almost before there was an Internet. As a Microsoftie, she had to file a special ticket to get a specialized team to get her set up so she could get real Internet Mail, and nobody else there could understand why anybody would want such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.enebo.com/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; is a Rubyist, we hired him and Charles Nutter at Sun in the mid-two-thousands. He takes good pictures too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re moving into the grayed-out territory, and I’ll take a quick tour through the alphabet; I manage to hit almost every letter. You might recognize some of the names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/A.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aitken&quot; title=&quot;Aitken&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was close to my ex-wife decades ago, then a development manager at the University of Waterloo; I liked her a lot but we’ve kind of lost touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/B.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Berners-Lee&quot; title=&quot;Berners-Lee&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/B.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard of this guy. Back in my W3C days, we drank like Churchill; not heavily but steadily. Tim’s always been on the right side of the important issues. He and I (and Jobs and Gates) were all born in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/C.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cantrill&quot; title=&quot;Cantrill&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/C.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me a whole lot about how the people who build kernels and filesystems think about them. He’s exhibited a regrettable tendency to JavaScript at certain times, but builds wonderful things. I think we’re competitors now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/D.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DiBona&quot; title=&quot;DiBona&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/D.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris sat for many years at the heart of Google’s culture and was a voice for sanity in a place that needed a whole lot more of it. Maybe he still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/E.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enns-Bray&quot; title=&quot;Enns-Bray&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/E.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nephew! Got his Ph.D. at ETH in Zürich in some scary combination of medicine and technology and is now making a living with it, still in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/F.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Faulkner, Ferraioli&quot; title=&quot;Faulkner, Ferraioli&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/F.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally’s a dear friend, does hospitality in Melbourne, we see her every other year, more or less. Julia’s been in Google DevRel, exhibiting courage and grace while she’s fought an endless struggle with the kind of health issue that renders the medical profession alternately helpless and counterproductive; I admire her immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/G.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gilbane&quot; title=&quot;Gilbane&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/G.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Frank was maybe the single most influential person in the world of publishing technology. I think he’s still working on it. I was briefly editor of &lt;cite&gt;The Gilbane Report&lt;/cite&gt;; I still remember a huge lifesaving lunch he bought me when a series of travel/schedule breakages meant that I’d not managed a square meal in two successive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/H.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hackborn, Hanley&quot; title=&quot;Hackborn, Hanley&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/H.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne is maybe the most accomplished software engineer the world has never heard of, buried in the bowels of Google. She was super helpful when I was trying to figure out how to be a voice for Android at Google. Dervala is a lovely person whose writing I worship, even though she only blogs annually these days. Stop what you’re doing and go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://dervala.com/&quot;&gt;The Wishing Chair, 2018&lt;/a&gt;; you’ll thank me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/Hoffman.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hoffman&quot; title=&quot;Hoffman&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Hoffman.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one frosts my socks; I’ve worked with Paul quite a bit and like him a lot and our chat linkage is irremediably broken behind some fucking XMPP SNAFU that I’m not smart enough to figure out and fix. He helps build the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/J.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Janssen&quot; title=&quot;Janssen&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/J.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen invented the various Devoxx-related conferences and has done a fine job, contributing to the structure of the software commmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/K.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kilmer, Kimber&quot; title=&quot;Kilmer, Kimber&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/K.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich is yet another Rubyist, lots of them in this episode; I miss being part of the Ruby family, it’s a fine place. Eliot was one of the original XML posse; we disagreed about almost every issue in the design of XML, but I never doubted his integrity or intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/L.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Leung&quot; title=&quot;Leung&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/L.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hired Ted at Sun as another smart tech blogger; we also have photography in common. I got to know him and his family pretty well in the first blog-centric social-media surge, and thought a lot of them; I hope that family is still intact and hanging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/M.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mansfield&quot; title=&quot;Mansfield&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/M.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another long parallel path. Phil was one of the inventors of SVG so I first met him in a standards context. Then our sons were on the same soccer teams (they still hang out sometimes) and our families became friends. But geography has intervened and we hardly see them any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/N.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nicol&quot; title=&quot;Nicol&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/N.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavin was doing magic with XML before there was XML. An eclectic and determined guy, I miss him. LinkedIn suggests he’s still in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/O.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;O’Reilly&quot; title=&quot;O’Reilly&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/O.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another name you might recognize; deserves credit for some of the nicer flavors you find in geek culture. The second O in “FOO” stands for O’Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;main-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/-big/P.jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pilgrim&quot; title=&quot;Pilgrim&quot; class=&quot;norm&quot; src=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/P.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Mark was maybe the most interesting person on the Internet. He disconnected with a bang, which decreased the value of the Net but may have saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Barefoot Programmer” and that’s not just figurative, I’ve seen him shoeless in situations that most reasonable people would consider unreasonable. Always on the right side of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hardly know Michael but we hung out a bit when he was head librarian at the University of Guelph and I was re-acquainting myself with the place; he never failed to charm me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill and I gave it our best shot at a startup but didn’t quite make it. I went to his wedding and miss him, although last time we spoke, he had the misfortune of being an Oracle employee. Randal Schwartz is a geek’s geek, just type his name into any search engine and prepare to be entertained. We’ve been on a cruise ship together, twice! And then there’s the Scobleizer, perhaps the canonical example of a life lived online. You can’t imagine what it was like in 2004-2005 when he was Microsoft’s Blogger and I was Sun’s and every word we wrote mattered. And did we ever write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandy is special to me because she represents the first time, as a member of a Google hiring committee, that I got to be part of hiring a Googler. Great fun online, and you just can’t get any more eclectic. Simon’s presence online is massive and he seems to be right about everything even if I never quite grasped his mapping method.

&lt;p&gt;Another couple of pioneers of the medium which you are now consuming; Jeremy was blogging &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; before blogging was cool.

&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Not blaming the Net&lt;/span&gt; · The fact that I’ve lost touch with so many of these people isn’t a technology problem, it’s me, me and the times we live in. Among the clear and present dangers to our way of life, once you get past Global Warming and deranged chiefs of state, the atomization of the social fabric is high, high on the list. I haven’t fought hard enough to stay connected (not alone in that). And time grows short.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>E.U.’s Biggest Economies Ban Boeing Max 8 Jets</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Pressure escalated inside the United States for a grounding of the Boeing 737 Max model that has crashed twice in the past six months. But the Federal Aviation Administration reiterated its position that the plane is considered safe and that it has “no basis to order grounding the aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• The European Union suspended “all flight operations” of the Boeing 737 Max model in question. The action came as more than a half-dozen other countries grounded the plane, and was the most sweeping regulatory action taken so far in the two days since the crash of a Max 8 that killed &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/world/africa/ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash-victims.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;157 people&lt;/a&gt; on a flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• President Trump had a telephone conversation with the chief executive of Boeing, who made the case that the 737 Max 8 should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Mr. Trump also said on Twitter that commercial airplanes had become overly technical, but said nothing about the Boeing Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• At least 34 airlines have now grounded the Max 8, which means roughly two-thirds of the Max 8 planes in operation are now idled. The major outliers are Southwest and American in the United States, and Air Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Boeing stands by the airworthiness of the plane, but said it planned to issue a software update and was working on changes to flight controls and training guidelines following the first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;[&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Read about&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/business/ethiopian-airline-crash.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;how the airplane maker is dealing with the fallout from the crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Boeing’s stock price, which fell 5 percent on Monday, fell 6 percent on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;• Investigators from the United States and elsewhere are at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Much of the investigation will focus on the voice and data recorders recovered on Monday. The airline’s chief executive, interviewed by CNN, said the pilots had told air traffic control they were having “flight control problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-532c3eaa&quot;&gt;E.U. issues comprehensive ban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The European Union’s aviation regulatory agency barred flights of the Max 8, as well as a slightly newer model, the Max 9, joining several other regulators around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The action, which includes all flights over European Union territory, came as India, France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Oman joined China and Indonesia in suspending all use of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The European Union regulator, known as EASA, said the action included the suspension of “all commercial flights performed by third-country operators into, within or out of the E.U.” of the Max 8 and Max 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The decision could disrupt travel not only through the heart of Europe but well beyond, as many commercial flight routes go over European Union territory. Still, the extent of the disruption is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Airlines and passengers will be affected as companies scramble to ensure that passengers can still get to their destinations, but the impact will depend on how much of their fleets are made up of the grounded planes, said Andrew Charlton, the managing director at Aviation Advocacy, an air transport consultancy based in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-1b61ebec&quot;&gt;U.S. and Canadian Airlines Becoming the Outliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Two United States airlines fly the 737 Max 8: Southwest has 34 and American 24. Both have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the planes and found no reason to ground them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t have any changes planned,” Southwest said in a statement. “We have full confidence in the aircraft,” American said. Air Canada, which operates 24 Max 8s, has given no indication it intends to ground them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;American Airlines, however, has faced growing pressure from its flight attendants union to temporarily ground the planes. Lori Bassani, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apfa.org/2019/03/11/3-11-19-press-release-ethiopian-airlines/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; members were calling on the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, to “strongly consider grounding these planes until a thorough investigation can be performed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While she did not say flight attendants would refuse to fly on the Max 8, “our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Adding to the pressure for action in the United States, at least three senators joined the call for grounding the plane. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, called on the F.A.A. to ground the aircraft while the cause of the Ethiopian crash is investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nonetheless the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, said in a statement late Tuesday that based on all available data, there was “no basis” to ground the plane. “Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-2386a1da&quot;&gt;Pilots reported ‘flight control problems,’ airline C.E.O. says&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 reported to air traffic control that they were having “flight control problems” in the moments before the crash, the airline’s chief executive was quoted as saying in an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/boeing-737-max-8-ethiopia-airlines-crash/h_9dee508ccc0a80f533a2bdafb8d5b536&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with CNN.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The quoted remarks from the chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, suggested the plane had not responded to actions by the pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. GebreMariam was also quoted as saying the black boxes recovered from the wreckage “will be sent overseas” and not analyzed in Ethiopia. He did not specify where they would be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-51efe6ff&quot;&gt;Trump speaks to Boeing C.E.O., who urges no grounding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Tuesday morning, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, spoke to President Trump on the phone and argued that the Max should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation. A Boeing official said that during the call with the president, “Dennis reiterated our position that the Max is a safe aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Muilenburg has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, but it has sometimes been an uneasy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-boeing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;assailed Boeing&lt;/a&gt; for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; a month after winning the election. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/business/donald-trump-boeing-lockheed.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club&lt;/a&gt; in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate. Weeks afterward, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help fund President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump also publicly lamented on Tuesday what he described as excessive technology that has overtaken modern commercial jet travel and made it, in his view, more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Without specifying Boeing or the Max 8, Mr. Trump said aircraft had become “far too complex to fly,” and recalled approvingly the era when pilots had total control in the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of postings on Twitter. “All this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Pilots and aviation experts have said repeatedly that flying is now safer than it has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1505tg eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-66a4fe2&quot;&gt;Boeing plans changes to plane’s control systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing is negotiating with the Federal Aviation Administration over improvements to its 737 Max 8 after the aircraft’s second crash in five months, though both the government and company insist the plane is safe to fly as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since October, when a Max 8 belonging to the budget airline Lion Air crashed in Indonesia soon after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board, Boeing has been working on changes to the flight control systems of the aircraft. The company has also been updating its training guidelines and manuals so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

The main changes now being developed to those systems include limiting how much the plane’s computers can automatically pull down the nose of the plane if sensors detect a stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The concern after the Lion Air crash was that erroneous readings from poorly maintained sensors in the nose of the plane might have fooled the automatic systems into falsely concluding that the plane was traveling sharply upward and in danger of stalling. The automatic systems may then have forced the nose down significantly, sending the plane into a steep dive into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A naturalized newlywed from Ethiopia, a health analyst headed to her first international project, and two brothers on vacation were among at least eight Americans on Flight 302.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The immigrant, Mucaad Hussein Abdalla, 31, a truck driver in St. Cloud, Minn., had just been married in Morocco; his wife, though, was not on the flight, according to Mr. Abdalla’s cousin, Mohamed Warfa. “He loved to play soccer in his free time, and he had many friends in this community,” Mr. Warfa said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Abdalla came to the United States from Ethiopia as a teenager, gained citizenship and supported his mother, brother and sister, who live in Ethiopia, said Mr. Warfa, 29, who created a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/the-siraajmu039aad-memorial-fund?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fb_dn_cpgntopstickysmall_r&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR1TfDCSzm_OtsEGIdTBzSw8Av7Wt42KkL_gFSFoVhdlbmNEYdgMkL6TBXM&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; page to help pay for the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Melvin Riffel, 30, and Bennett Riffel, 26, were on a vacation that included a stop in Australia.

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Melvin worked at the California Department of Transportation. “He was a dedicated civil servant who worked for Caltrans for nearly a decade, and our deepest sympathy and condolences go out to his family, friends and colleagues,” said the Caltrans director, Laurie Berman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Matt Vecere, 43, of Long Beach, Calif., was en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly this week in Nairobi. “Matt was passionate about the environment, civil rights, social and environmental justice, and advocating for those less fortunate,” his mother, Donna Vecere, said in a statement. Mr. Vecere had recently been in Haiti, where he had made several trips after the 2010 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;author-timestamp&quot; itemprop=&quot;datePublished&quot; content=&quot;2019-03-12T06:11-500&quot;&gt;March 12 at 6:11 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The Justice Department on Tuesday charged 50 people — including two television stars — with participating in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme that enabled privileged students with lackluster grades to attend prestigious colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The alleged crimes included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/college-admissions-bribery-scheme-affidavit/d216435e-e073-41f6-b6fa-33ed835d053d_note.html?questionId=c2ba5e52-6a22-42ed-a0c9-05c83ee5f83d&amp;amp;utm_term=.c9ada139d5f3&quot;&gt;Read the affidavit: FBI charges 50 in college admissions bribery scheme&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Boston’s U.S. attorney, Andrew Lelling, called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBI’s Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;The scheme was discovered accidentally by the FBI while working an unrelated undercover operation about a year ago, officials said. That tip led to a sprawling, nationwide corruption probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;“These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,” said Lelling. “This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I’ll add there will not be a separate criminal-justice system, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;No students were charged because prosecutors said their parents were the scheme’s principal actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/college-admissions-bribery-scheme-affidavit/d216435e-e073-41f6-b6fa-33ed835d053d_note.html?questionId=c2ba5e52-6a22-42ed-a0c9-05c83ee5f83d&amp;amp;utm_term=.c9ada139d5f3&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Court filings released Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; paint an ugly picture of privileged parents committing crimes to get their children into selective schools otherwise unlikely to accept them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Among those charged are actresses Felicity Huffman, best known for her role on the television show “Desperate Housewives,” and Lori Loughlin, who appeared on “Full House.” A representative for Loughlin declined to comment. A representative for Huffman did not return messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Others arrested Tuesday include a private-equity executive in northern California, a senior lawyer at a major law firm in New York, and a public relations executive in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said they took part in a criminal conspiracy to bribe test officials and college sports officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;In the wake of the charges, universities began firing or placing on leave some of the accused coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The scheme’s chief architect, William Singer, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday. Officials described Singer as a well-connected college admissions adviser and say he disguised the bribery scheme as a charity, enabling parents to deduct the bribes from their taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Singer was charged with taking about $25 million from 2011 to 2018 — paying some of it to college coaches or standardized-testing officials for their help rigging the admissions process and pocketing the rest, according to the criminal complaint. He allegedly disguised the money using a nonprofit, the Key Worldwide Foundation, which prosecutors described as a slush fund for bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges for racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. He had been cooperating since September. Prosecutors said that a month after he came to the government’s side, Singer alerted several people under investigation about the inquiry — which earned him the obstruction charge. Lawyers for Singer did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Another defendant is Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of the international law firm Willkie Farr &amp;amp; Gallagher. Neither Caplan nor his firm immediately responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Court papers charge that in one secretly recorded conversation, Caplan asked Singer: “If somebody catches this, what happens?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;“The only one who can catch it is if you guys tell somebody,” Singer replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;“I’m not going to tell anybody,” Caplan said, and the two men laughed, according to the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;Two California parents paid Singer in the form of Facebook stock — 2,150 shares worth $251,159 at the time of the bribe in July 2016, according to court papers. Those parents claimed that payment as a charitable donation, the papers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Early in the investigation, the FBI was able to flip Yale’s former women’s soccer coach, who provided evidence against others, officials said. Rudolph Meredith pleaded guilty nearly a year ago, after prosecutors gathered evidence he took a $400,000 bribe to pretend that one prospective student was a recruit, despite the fact that the student in question did not play competitive soccer. The student’s parents paid $1.2 million in bribes, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, sent a letter to the Yale community calling the allegations “an affront to our university’s deeply held values of inclusion and fairness. I want to assure our community,” it says, “that I am committed to making certain the integrity of the admissions and athletic recruitment processes is not undermined again. As the investigation unfolds, the university may take further actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Prosecutors also charged Georgetown’s former head tennis coach, Gordon Ernst. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits — when they were not tennis players of that caliber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;For example, prosecutors alleged, Ernst flagged a California couple’s daughter as a “potential spot,” and her application falsely indicated she had played club tennis through high school and achieved a Top 50 ranking in the U.S. Tennis Association’s junior girls category from her sophomore through her senior years. In fact, she had not played at any Tennis Association tournaments in high school, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;“At her best,” prosecutors wrote, “she appears to have ranked 207th in Northern California in the under-12 girls division, with an overall win/loss record of 2-8.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;In a statement, Georgetown said the school was “deeply disappointed” to learn of the criminal charges against Ernst and said he “has not coached our tennis team since December 2017, following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions. Georgetown cooperated fully with the government’s investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;After leaving Georgetown, Ernst was hired as the University of Rhode Island’s tennis coach. The school said Tuesday he had been placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes so their two daughters would be designated as recruits for the University of Southern California crew team — even though they were not part of the team. That helped the pair get into USC, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Some of the money was directed to Donna Heinel, a USC athletics official, the complaint alleges. In a statement, USC officials said the school is cooperating with the federal investigation and has launched its own review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Jovan Vavic, the former water polo coach at USC, was charged with taking bribes to pretend students flagged by Singer were recruits for the team. Prosecutors alleged Singer paid private-school tuition payments for Vavic’s children, under the guise of a fabricated scholarship. Vavic did not return an email seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;USC said Tuesday that Heinel and Vavic had been fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;“We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university,” the statement says. “USC is conducting an internal investigation and will take employment actions as appropriate . . . the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Besides fake athletic credentials, the other main thrust of Singer’s schemes involved cheating on college entrance exams. Sometimes that was done by paying a 36-year-old Florida man, Mark Riddell, to take the tests for students. Riddell was so proficient at the exams that he could get a perfect score or calibrate his answers to get very high marks but not a perfect score, the U.S. attorney said. Riddell also agreed to plead guilty in the case and cooperate with investigators, according to officials. Riddell did not immediately return messages, and no attorney was listed for him in court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Other defendants are accused of bribing college entrance exam administrators to facilitate cheating — in some cases, providing students with answers to exams or correcting their answers after they had completed the exams, according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;Prosecutors said a key element of the test-cheating scheme was to make arrangements for the tests to be administered privately over a two-day period, making it easier for Riddell stand in for the students or for a corrupt test administrator to fix the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 — disguised as a charitable donation — to the Key Worldwide Foundation so her oldest daughter could participate in the scam. A confidential informant told investigators that he advised Huffman that he could arrange for a third party to correct her daughter’s answers on the SAT after she took it. She ended up scoring a 1420 — 400 points higher than she had gotten on a PSAT taken a year earlier, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Huffman also contemplated running a similar scam to help her younger daughter but ultimately did not pursue it, the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Other defendants include William McGlashan, a senior executive at a global private-equity firm, TPG Growth, which is a major investor in the ride-hailing service Uber and the music-streaming app Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;A TPG spokesman said “as a result of the charges of personal misconduct against Bill McGlashan,” he has been placed on “indefinite administrative leave effective immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;According to the criminal charges against McGlashan, he and Singer agreed to trick admissions officials at USC into believing McGlashan’s son was a kicker for a football team — even though his high school didn’t have a football team. Singer offered to edit an image of the child’s head onto a photo of a football kicker, officials alleged. As they discussed it, McGlashan said the situation was “pretty funny,” court documents say. “The way the world works these days is unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot; class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Nick Anderson, Moriah Balingit, Julie Tate, Susan Svrluga and Morgan Smith contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On “Open” Distros, Open Source, and Building a Company</title>
<link>https://www.elastic.co/blog/on-open-distros-open-source-and-building-a-company</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.elastic.co/blog/on-open-distros-open-source-and-building-a-company</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Elastic, our focus is on building great products, forming communities around them, and making our users successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I sat down and wrote the first few lines of Elasticsearch and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; it. I quit my job and spent two years investing in building the product and fostering the amazing community that has been built around it. In 2012 we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search-inc&quot;&gt;formed a company&lt;/a&gt;, Elastic, around it. We have invested in our community of users and embraced the ecosystem of open source products developed around it. We added so many features to Apache Lucene I lost count, making it the strong foundation we all build on top. We have added Kibana, created by Rashid, Logstash created by Jordan, and PacketBeat created by Monica and Tudor, to name a few. We built the products out, fostered the communities around them, and focused on providing the most amount of value to our users. Today, we have hundreds of Elastic developers that work every single day on this vast undertaking. We have hundreds of thousands of community members contributing to our shared success every day. And I am proud of the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code&quot;&gt;we built&lt;/a&gt; to foster it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built a level of trust with our user base that I am proud and humbled by. It starts with being open, and continues with being true to our community and user base in what we do. We also focused on making sure nothing distracts us from that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, ever since we started, we have dealt with FUD. If you build something successful, it is bound to happen. The FUD mostly comes from large(r) companies that fear what such a movement can cause. It is only natural. &quot;Don't use the product, it is a toy.&quot; &quot;It only has a handful of developers, what happens if they get hit by a bus?&quot; &quot;They don't know what &quot;the enterprise&quot; wants.&quot; &quot;They are not true X or Y or Z (insert your word of the day).&quot; We have never let it affect us, or let it occupy our mind. It is done in order to distract us and our community from our main purpose, build great products and communities, that users love. We fail our users if we let it, and we will never fail you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our products were forked, redistributed and rebundled so many times I lost count. It is a sign of success and the reach our products have. From various vendors, to large Chinese entities, to now, Amazon. There was always a &quot;reason&quot;, at times masked with fake altruism or benevolence. None of these have lasted. They were built to serve their own needs, drive confusion, and splinter the community. Our commitment and focus on building great products and communities, that users love, formed our way, and it resonated with you, our users. We built a level of trust with you, an expected rate of innovation, and amazing collaboration, that simply IS, and you saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/about/why-open-source&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, and the power it brings. We also communicated from the start that some features will be commercial, and why. Our honesty, I believe, is a big reason for our shared success. We built our open source code in a way that allows for it to be pluggable and cleanly implemented. We haven't changed our way since we started, building trust with our users for years that we stand by our word, and by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commercial code has been an &quot;inspiration&quot; for others, it has been bluntly copied by various companies, and even found its way back to certain distributions or forks, like the freshly minted Amazon one, sadly, painfully, with critical bugs. We kept on being focused on building great products and communities, that users love. We did not let it distract us, and this focus has paid back tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brand has been used and abused, hijacked, and misrepresented many times. Companies have falsely claimed that they work in collaboration with our company, topically &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Werner/status/649738362086027265&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We did not let it distract us, we kept on building great products and communities, that users love. Dilution of focus is the enemy of a company, and we never let it affect us. It is you that matter, our users, not the noise around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we joined forces with companies, we opened up the code. When we started to see our users use us for APM, we were all excited about it. We joined forces with a pure SaaS company in the APM space called OpBeat, which was a big commercial investment on our end, and open sourced most of it, and made all of it free. It was such a simple decision, since we focus on building great products and communities, that users love, and you, our users, deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When others closed down, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open&quot;&gt;opened up&lt;/a&gt;. We kept our open source code the same, under the same license, and doubled down on being open as a company. We relicensed our existing commercial code under a more permissive license, and opened up the code. Trying to foster the same level of collaboration and transparency we have in our open source code across everything we do. This was done in direct reaction to the many discussions we had with our users, and I am so happy to see it has resonated so much with you. Our level of investment in open source since then has only increased, as has our commitment to more free features and experiences, clearly marked and clearly distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When companies came to us, seeing our success, and asked for special working relationship in order to collaborate on code, demanding preferential treatment that would place them above our users, we told them no. This happened numerous times over the years, and only recently again, this time with Amazon. Some have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/6515&quot;&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; and became wonderful partners to us and the community. Others, sadly, didn't follow through. We have a commitment that we will treat a single developer contributing to our products the same as others. There is no preference, and we will reject any ask to have one. Our answer has always been a constant: send a pull request, like everybody else does. The quality will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write all of this for several reasons. The first, is that we all sometimes need to self reflect on what and why we did that made us successful, to make sure we stay true to our course. With you, our users, our community, our company. Second, to others out there, that face so many reasons to be distracted, keep your focus, and stay true, it is the only thing that matters. And last, to express our shared commitment to continue to build great products and communities, that users love. It is our true north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always Day 0 at Elastic (like the developers we serve, we use zero based numbering). Nothing has changed from the first line of code I wrote to the 10 years of journey we had with all of you, our users, and to the many years to come. I :elasticheart: y'all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox Send: Free encrypted file transfer service</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we are always committed to people’s security and privacy. It’s part of our long-standing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. We are continually looking for new ways to fulfill that promise, whether it’s through the browser, apps or services. So, it felt natural to graduate one of our popular Test Pilot experiments, &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Send&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://send.firefox.com&quot;&gt;send.firefox.com&lt;/a&gt;. Send is a free encrypted file transfer service that allows users to safely and simply share files from any browser. Additionally, Send will also be available as an Android app in beta later this week. Now that it’s a keeper, we’ve made it even better, offering higher upload limits and greater control over the files you share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how Firefox Send works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRHpEn2eHJA&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption &amp;amp; Controls at your fingertips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the last time you moved into a new apartment or purchased a home and had to share financial information like your credit report over the web. In situations like this, you may want to offer the recipient one-time or limited access to those files. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt;, you can feel safe that your personal information does not live somewhere in the cloud indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt; uses end-to-end encryption to keep your data secure from the moment you share to the moment your file is opened. It also offers security controls that you can set. You can choose when your file link expires, the number of downloads, and whether to add an optional password for an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_12053&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12053 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;2070&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1.png 2500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1-300x248.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1-768x636.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1-600x497.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-TWO-1-1000x828.png 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Choose when your file link expires, the number of downloads and add an optional password&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share large files &amp;amp; navigate with ease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt; also makes it simple to share large file sizes – perfect for sharing professional design files  or collaborating on a presentation with co-workers. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt; you can share file sizes up to 1GB quickly. To send files up to 2.5GB, sign up for a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/&quot;&gt;Firefox account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy for your recipient, too. No hoops to jump through. They simply receive a link to click and download the file. They don’t need to have a Firefox account to access your file. Overall, this makes the sharing experience seamless for both parties, and as quick as sending an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_12054&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-12054 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;2070&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1.png 2500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1-300x248.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1-768x636.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1-600x497.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Firefox-Send-Blog-Post-ONE-1-1000x828.png 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Sharing large file sizes is simple and quick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know there are several cloud sharing solutions out there, but as a continuation of our mission to bring you more private and safer choices, you can trust that your information is safe with &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt;. As with all Firefox apps and services, &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/&quot;&gt;Private By Design&lt;/a&gt;, meaning all of your files are protected and we stand by our mission to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/&quot;&gt;handle your data privately and securely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re sharing important personal information, private documents or confidential work files you can start sending your files for free with &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Send&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A JavaScript-Free Front End</title>
<link>https://dev.to/winduptoy/a-javascript-free-frontend-2d3e</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dev.to/winduptoy/a-javascript-free-frontend-2d3e</guid>
<description>&lt;h6&gt; &lt;em&gt;Slimvoice - A Webapp Without JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; is a series where I document how I rebuilt my app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;Slimvoice&lt;/a&gt;, using as little JavaScript as possible. I've tagged this series with JavaScript to present JavaScript alternatives and encourage those who reach for a SPA for every project to give it a second thought.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built the first version of Slimvoice on Angular 1 with a Node.js backend and MongoDB in 2014 (those were all the rage back then). In 2015 I decided to completely revamp the UI and redesigned and rebuilt it in React. In hindsight, all of that was crap. With the new version I wanted to prove that it was possible to &lt;strong&gt;deliver an amazing user experience with a great design while drastically reducing the complexity of the code, maximizing reliability, and minimizing the cost to the end user&lt;/strong&gt;. I've got the frontend to a state that I'm really proud of. Here I'll break down the decisions I made on the frontend and share some JavaScript-free UI tricks I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M7HqlD0e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2uk871wqxv5qa2rfmobe.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M7HqlD0e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2uk871wqxv5qa2rfmobe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Potted plant&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm&quot;&gt;The Website Obesity Problem&lt;/a&gt; is not getting any better for the web at large. I'm tired of slow-to-load webapps that are not very reliable. Has anyone tried modifying the description of a card in &lt;a href=&quot;https://asana.com&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt; lately? It's freaking slow! The UI lags for no good reason as you type. First, I live in a rural area with only 2 Mbit/s down Internet connection. With a &lt;strong&gt;warm&lt;/strong&gt; cache it takes &lt;strong&gt;14 seconds&lt;/strong&gt; for the Asana UI to become usable. Second, you can see below that the app is comprised of over 10MB of uncompressed JavaScript. That is a huge amount of code to execute. How is this acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dl23wvG3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4r5b9pwdv9uznema8m51.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dl23wvG3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4r5b9pwdv9uznema8m51.png&quot; alt=&quot;Asana load time&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a &quot;progressive web app&quot; of a moderate level of complexity you need a team of people to make it work. You end up with a massive portion of your codebase being just for the frontend. Seriously. Getting things to load in the right order is a difficult problem that we're just throwing even more software at (see Redux and friends). What if you could just do away with all of that? The more code you have, the less agile you are. &lt;strong&gt;Code is a liability, not an asset. It's like tar.&lt;/strong&gt; JavaScript libraries are getting bigger all the time and I don't think that many people are critically evaluating the actual need for them. People frequently measure JavaScript in KB or MB as if it is just a download cost. But it's not. You also have to wait for the CPU to parse/execute it. It all adds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;710&quot; height=&quot;399&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yx6k6WR8GRs&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright. Lean in close. I have discovered a secret that I will share with you about frontend development. Very few people know this, so don't go running your mouth. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your frontend can't crash if you don't use JavaScript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; HTML doesn't throw exceptions. Less code is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://elm-lang.org&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt; for being pretty dang awesome, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;Slimvoice&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to go against the grain of the modern JS hype train and make the app entirely server rendered. You might say &quot;Ah! But Matt! The user must reload every page when using your app, which must be slow!&quot; to which I say phooey. &lt;strong&gt;All of my assets are gzipped and cached&lt;/strong&gt;, which leaves only the HTML to transfer as you interact. I don't have loading spinners. It's faster than many PWAs I use by a long shot. Don't take my word for it, open your dev tools network panel and compare &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;Slimvoice&lt;/a&gt; to some popular PWAs. Oh yeah, and I don't have JavaScript exceptions to debug in the console. &lt;em&gt;Either the page showed up on your screen or it didn't.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CudH4RGN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jlq4g7hc6o9499011u9s.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CudH4RGN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jlq4g7hc6o9499011u9s.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slimvoice load time&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; The Checkbox/Label Trick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are some interactions in which reloading the page would be unacceptable. Here's my favorite trick to add interactivity to an otherwise static HTML page. I used this for all dropdowns, modals, and filtering UIs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;Slimvoice&lt;/a&gt;, all without JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;myToggledUI&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; containing some UI that you would like to show and hide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately above that, create an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;myToggle&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This will make an invisible checkbox in the DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever DOM node you would like to use as the toggle control, wrap it in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label for=&quot;myToggle&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag where the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; attribute matches the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this CSS to hook it all up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#myToggledUI {
    display: none;
}
#myToggle:checked ~ #myToggledUI {
    display: block;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This CSS says that the &lt;code&gt;#myToggledUI&lt;/code&gt; element immediately preceded by a checked &lt;code&gt;#myToggle&lt;/code&gt; element should be shown, otherwise hidden. The &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; operator is pretty cool! &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/winduptoy/8qfvb1az/&quot;&gt;Here's a full working example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a modal built with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a checkbox. The &quot;Cancel&quot; button is another &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for the same checkbox, so clicking it closes the modal. There is a gray overlay behind the modal (&lt;code&gt;position: fixed;&lt;/code&gt;) that also happens to be a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for the same checkbox, so clicking outside of the modal closes it as well. No React components. No click event listeners. Just plain and simple HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VM2mGgBv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/03ewrwfn2o897f1wchal.gif&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VM2mGgBv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/03ewrwfn2o897f1wchal.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A JavaScript-free modal&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No JavaScript!
&lt;p&gt;I haven't done so here, but you can add any CSS transitions that you like to this technique. No &lt;code&gt;ReactCSSTransitionGroup&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qwqZ8D1---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d9qgvewdnt33t7iwm80x.gif&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qwqZ8D1---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d9qgvewdnt33t7iwm80x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A JavaScript-free popup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No JavaScript!
&lt;h2&gt; The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_summary.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags are rarely used but perfectly acceptable for many cases. I used them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co/terms#acknowledgements&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/a&gt; page to show and hide the licenses for the various pieces of open source software I used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;Slimvoice&lt;/a&gt;. Quick. Easy. No JavaScript. Works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that you can't control much of their appearance, but I do not think that making a small disclosure triangle match your brand standards is worthy of forcing a few megabytes of JavaScript on a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Forms &amp;amp; Input Validation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many inputs have validation options built-in. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation&quot;&gt;Mozilla documentation&lt;/a&gt; is comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't forget about the &lt;code&gt;required&lt;/code&gt; attribute, that prevents a form from submitting until a particular field is filled out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number inputs have &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text inputs can be of type &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, or a custom &lt;code&gt;pattern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text inputs have &lt;code&gt;minlength&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxlength&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:valid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:invalid&lt;/code&gt; CSS selectors allow for a better UX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B7PezxYJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pbnluquepqvc2lfv7ra4.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B7PezxYJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pbnluquepqvc2lfv7ra4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Invalid email input&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No JavaScript!

&lt;p&gt;I did actually use some JavaScript on the new Slimvoice, but only when an interaction could not be replicated in any other way. For example, I implemented fuzzy search on the clients list to let you easily filter clients. &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co/static/js/client_select.js&quot;&gt;Take a look at the production code&lt;/a&gt; (you might need to copy/paste the URL in a new tab, my server tries to prevent hot-linking). It's not complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GOLRAj7N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qn59qb7q746s796xnbb2.gif&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GOLRAj7N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qn59qb7q746s796xnbb2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fuzzy Search&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deemed it was critical to have invoice line items be drag-and-drop sortable, so I employed &lt;a href=&quot;https://mithril.js.org/&quot;&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt; just for the invoice editing UI. It's the one and only JS dependency in the whole project (and only on a single page), and when I have some time in the future I would love to remove it altogether. &lt;strong&gt;There's so little JavaScript in the app that it wouldn't even matter if I minified it, so I didn't.&lt;/strong&gt; Go read my sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jESAl7Z4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8bhp7fb37mohoiodexya.gif&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jESAl7Z4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8bhp7fb37mohoiodexya.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Drag and Drop&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain HTML inputs covered most of my needs, but I found myself wishing for more innovation in the HTML spec to cover more inputs and remove the need for JavaScript altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why can't we have a standard search element that filters a list on the client side (similar to how &lt;code&gt;ng-repeat | filter:&lt;/code&gt; worked on Angular 1)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wouldn't a standard HTML element for drag-and-drop sorting be awesome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More advanced validation functionality, like comparing equality of two different form fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to do the modal/checkbox trick above without it feeling like a hack and writing weird CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have the UI options for the HTML spec stagnated and left it up to building custom JavaScript-driven elements? I think having a more robust set of standard UI elements is way more important than WebVR, WebBluetooth, or whatever other insanity they're cooking up these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8eMJG5cm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9dtcwnzr3dg42jwq4fgt.png&quot; class=&quot;article-body-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8eMJG5cm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9dtcwnzr3dg42jwq4fgt.png&quot; alt=&quot;A folder&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it work? Absolutely. A full reload of the biggest page is 230 KB over the Internet. Since I'm caching and gzipping everything, each subsequent pageview is around 6 KB; far smaller than the SPAs I've seen with equivalent functionality. Slimvoice is fast and small but doesn't compromise on UX. Users are loving it so far. See it for yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;https://slimvoice.co&quot;&gt;https://slimvoice.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely nothing is complex about my code. I would feel comfortable handing the entire codebase off to someone else without explaining anything. I don't know anyone who can realistically say that about a React/Webpack frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been programming for over a decade and been building web apps full-time for six years of that. In those years the benefits of JavaScript and PWAs have proven themselves to not be that great, but their downsides are huge and often ignored. I'm completely done with JavaScript as a primary language for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You probably don't need a &quot;Progressive Web App.&quot; Seriously evaluate if your app needs such complexity. The boss/client may demand a PWA because it's cool and popular and will back it up with a bunch of hand-wavy reasons. Make sure those reasons are legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop tracking people. Don't allow other companies to do so on your behalf. You will survive without Google Analytics. You will survive without Intercom. Serve everything from your own domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be scared. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; build it yourself! You &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need a framework!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't follow the hype. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/phi_vUKGbuE?t=10768&quot;&gt;Make critical decisions about why one approach is better than another&lt;/a&gt;, despite what the marketing page says or what everyone else is doing. The people selling the cool new stuff are typically sweeping the downsides under the rug. Everything has a cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm extremely happy with how this version of Slimvoice turned out, but of course looking for ways to bring the JavaScript usage down to zero. I'd be happy to answer any questions about the design or development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, thanks to my amazing wife who designed the splash page, helped with the UI, and encouraged me to write this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up next:&lt;/strong&gt; I'll share some details about the Slimvoice backend, how it has evolved over the years, and what I did to make the development process of a server-rendered app as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest fears when Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/post-mortem-tying-edge-to-windows-10-was-a-fatal-error/&quot;&gt;announced that it was ditching its EdgeHTML rendering engine&lt;/a&gt; and switching to Chromium—the open source engine that powers Google's Chrome, along with a range of others such as Vivaldi, Brave, and Opera—is that Web developers would increasingly take the easy way out and limit their support and testing to Chrome. That would leave Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, and any other browsers, present or future, out of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, after all, substantially what we saw during Internet Explorer's heyday. Microsoft's browser grew to about 95 percent of the market, and wide swathes of the Web proudly announced that they were &quot;best viewed in Internet Explorer,&quot; often to the point of not working at all in any other browser. IE's hegemony presented an enormous challenge for the upstart Firefox browser, which was built to support Web standards rather than Microsoft's particular spin on those standards. Though Internet Explorer was eventually displaced—by Chrome—this arguably would have gone much quicker if developers had been less fixated on Microsoft's browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.skype.com/news/2019/03/07/the-new-skype-for-web-is-here/&quot;&gt;major update&lt;/a&gt; to the Web version of its Skype client, bringing HD video calling, call recording, and other features already found on the other clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if to prove a point, the update works only in Edge and Chrome. Firefox, Safari, and even Opera are locked out. In the past, the Skype team has pointed to codec issues as the reason for inconsistent browser support. But that shouldn't be a concern these days, as both the H.264 and VP8 video codecs are supported in Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. Google Hangouts and Google Meet support plugin-free video calling in Firefox, for example, as have other online services. For a long time, Apple refused to support WebRTC—the underlying browser technology used for real-time voice and video chatting—in Safari. But even that feature gap doesn't exist any more, and Safari should now support everything required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, users who have tried changing their user-agent—the identification string, sent by browsers, that tells Web servers what version of which browser they are—have reported that much of the app works in both Safari and Firefox, with reports that even &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/aw1umv/skype_web_is_now_blocked_in_firefox/ehk5446/&quot;&gt;voice and video calls&lt;/a&gt; work in Firefox. It's not clear that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; works, and WebRTC is arguably persnickety enough that Microsoft would have to explicitly test and perhaps tweak its code to work in Firefox or Safari. But ultimately, none of this appears to be a fundamental tech issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, it's a &lt;em&gt;being bothered to do the work&lt;/em&gt; issue. Microsoft has said that its decision to prioritize Edge and Chrome is based on &quot;customer value.&quot; Or, to put it another way, there's not much point in taking the time and effort to support browsers that have a small audience. This creates a negative feedback loop for those browsers, discouraging their use and pushing developers toward a world in which Chrome is the only browser that developers think about and target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's perhaps also some irony in that the Skype app is built with a framework designed to foster cross-platform development, between devices, desktop, and the Web. For those who can use the Web app, it looks extremely similar to the desktop apps, which also look very similar to the mobile apps. That's because it's built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/&quot;&gt;ReactXP&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's layer on top of Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react-native/&quot;&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt; frameworks. These let you use Web technology to build applications not just for the Web but also the desktop and smartphone platforms. When targeting the Web, ReactXP &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/docs/faq.html&quot;&gt;supports Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing once again that this isn't really a technology question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't the first company to treat the Web this way, and it won't be the last. There was a time when the market was more evenly split, and no single browser vendor could exercise monopoly control over the way the Web was developed. This environment brought standardization to the foreground; standardization was the only way to make the variety tractable for developers. But as we slide back into a near-monopoly situation, this kind of thing is probably only going to become more common. Skype for Web is simply a high-profile demonstration of everything people worried about when Microsoft announced its switch.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 22 Prof Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser, but he rose to serve as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his death on 14 March 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43607447/crowds-bid-farewell-to-stephen-hawking-at-funeral&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;crowds lined the streets&lt;/a&gt; to bid farewell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can buy the commemorative coins from the Royal Mint's website, with prices starting at £10 for a brilliant uncirculated version, climbing to £795 for a gold proof coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hawking has also been suggested as the new face of the £50 banknote, which will feature a scientist. A decision will be made in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked. Suppose I could program my computer to create a space in which everything could be linked to everything.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteright&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the world’s largest physics laboratory, CERN, was a hive of ideas and information stored on multiple incompatible computers. Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned a unifying structure for linking information across different computers, and wrote a proposal in March 1989 called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cds.cern.ch/record/369245/files/dd-89-001.pdf&quot;&gt;Information Management: A Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. By 1991 this vision of universal connectivity had become the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Celebration at CERN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate 30 years since Sir Tim Berners-Lee's proposal and to kick-start a series of celebrations worldwide, &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/&quot;&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt; hosted a 30th Anniversary event in the morning of &lt;strong&gt;12 March 2019&lt;/strong&gt; in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&lt;/a&gt; and with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anniversary event was webcast, with Web@30 Viewing Parties watching live worldwide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Live from CERN&lt;/h2&gt;
