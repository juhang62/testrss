&lt;td readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;I work remotely as a front-end developer at a VC-funded, series B startup. Funding has dried up as investors with financial exposure to anything retail or entertainment-related are hemorrhaging cash. The company leadership told us that starting immediately, all employees (including the fully-remote workers like myself) are on mandatory unpaid leave.
&lt;p&gt;Job cuts in 2019 were already up a whopping 351% from the previous year[1]. Considering the COVID-19 outbreak, I'm concerned that many other tech workers like me might be updating their resumes and entering a stagnant job market. Alternatively, organizations may view this as a great time to gain additional market share. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a tech worker, have you been laid off or do you expect to be laid off soon? If you are a hiring manager, what is the current hiring status at your company?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Launch HN: Fly.io (YC W20) – Deploy app servers close to your users</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22616857</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22616857</guid>
<description>Hello Hacker News! We're Kurt, Jerome, and Michael from fly.io (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://fly.io/&lt;/a&gt;). We're building a platform to run Docker applications close to end users. It's kind of like a content delivery network, but for backend servers.
&lt;p&gt;I helped build Ars Technica and spent the majority of my time trying to make the site fast. We used a content delivery network to cache static content close to anonymous readers and it worked very well for them. But the most valuable readers were not these, but the ones who paid for subscriptions. They wanted personalized content and features for interacting with the community – and we couldn't make those fast. Content delivery networks don't work for Ars Technica's best customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running Docker apps close to users helps get past the &quot;slow&quot; speed of light. Most interactions with an app server seem slow because of latency between the hardware it's running on (frequently in Virginia) and the end user (frequently not in Virginia). Moving server apps close to users is a simple way to decrease latency, sometimes by 80% or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fly.io is really a way to run Docker images on servers in different cities and a global router to connect users to the nearest available instance. We convert your Docker image into a root filesystem, boot tiny VMs using a project called Firecracker (recently discussed here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22512196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22512196&lt;/a&gt;) and then proxy connections to it. As your app gets more traffic, we add VMs in the most popular locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote a Rust based router to distribute incoming connections from end users. The router terminates TLS when necessary (some customers handle their own TLS) and then hands the connection off to the best available Firecracker VM, which is frequently in a different city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking took us a lot of time to get right. Applications get dedicated IP addresses from an Anycast block. Anycast is an internet routing feature that lets us &quot;announce&quot; from multiple datacenters, and then core routers pick the destination with the shortest route (mostly). We run a mesh Wireguard network for backhaul, so in flight data is encrypted all the way into a user application. This is the same kind of network infrastructure the good content delivery networks use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a handful of enterprise companies to pay for this, and spent almost a year making it simple to use — it takes 3 commands to deploy a Docker image and have it running in 17 cities: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/&lt;/a&gt;. We also built &quot;Turboku&quot; to speed up Heroku apps. Pick a Heroku app and we deploy the slug on our infrastructure .. typical Heroku apps are 800ms faster on fly.io: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io/heroku/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://fly.io/heroku/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also built some features based on Hacker News comments. When people launch container hosting on Hacker News, there's almost always a comment asking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. gRPC support: apps deployed to fly.io can accept any kind of TCP connection. We kept seeing people say &quot;hey I want to run gRPC servers on this shiney container runtime&quot;. So you can! You can specify if you want us to do TLS or HTTP for an app, or just do everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Max monthly spend: unexpected traffic spikes happen, and the thought of spending an unbounded amount of money in a month is really uncomfortable. You can configure fly.io apps with a max monthly budget, we'll suspend them when they hit that budget, and then re-enable them at the beginning of the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of building this has been seeing the problems that developers are trying to solve, often problems we didn't know about beforehand. My favorite is a project to re-encode MP3s at variable speeds for specific users (apparently the Apple Audiobook player has no option for playback speed). Another is &quot;TensorFlow at the edge&quot; — they trained a TensorFlow model to detect bots and run predictions before handling requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really happy we get to show this to you all, thank you for reading about it! Please let us know your thoughts and questions in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submitted by Taps Coogan on the 18th of March 2020 to The Sounding Line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been less than a month since the S&amp;amp;P 500 last hit an all-time but already the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to zero, launched a massive $700 billion QE program, announced up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/12/frazzled-fed-rolls-out-fastest-mega-money-printer-ever-up-to-4-5-trillion-in-four-weeks/&quot;&gt;$4.5 trillion of subsidized repos&lt;/a&gt; offerings over the next month, backstopped the commercial paper market, and completely suspended bank reserve requirements. The federal government has postponed April tax collections and announced billions of dollars of additional spending. Now there is talk of a $850 billion federal stimulus &amp;amp; bailout package that would include a $50 billion bailout of the airline industry alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one month into this crisis and some of the largest companies in America are already lobbying for a massive taxpayer funded bailout. As a point of reference, it took a year of deep recession to get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoundingline.com/fed-response-to-coronavirus-already-exceeds-its-response-to-global-financial-crisis/&quot;&gt;this point during the Financial Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quads-location quads-ad2&quot; id=&quot;quads-ad2&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4401495442679385&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2384793605&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start of 2015 through the third quarter of 2019, the most recent date for which &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500&quot;&gt;complete data&lt;/a&gt; is available, the companies that comprise the S&amp;amp;P 500 spent $2.9 trillion on stock buybacks and $2 trillion on dividends. As we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoundingline.com/sp-500-buybacks-now-outpace-all-rd-spending-in-the-us/&quot;&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt;, not only are these companies spending more on buybacks than the entire US spends on R&amp;amp;D (including universities and federal research), they have spent more on dividends and buybacks than they have actually earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, dividends and buybacks by S&amp;amp;P 500 companies since the start of 2015 amount to roughly $5 trillion compared to cumulative reported earnings of just $4.5 trillion. Instead of investing in better products and people, paying down debt, or saving for an inevitable rainy day, Corporate America has been blowing trillions of dollars on buybacks to boost share prices and executive bonuses. In many cases, they have been borrowing money to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;blob:https://thesoundingline.com/6790b87b-b961-4eff-9818-240db7789728&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cumulative-SP-500-earnings-dividends-buybacks-and-rd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-48162&quot; srcset=&quot;https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cumulative-SP-500-earnings-dividends-buybacks-and-rd.png 1020w, https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cumulative-SP-500-earnings-dividends-buybacks-and-rd-300x204.png 300w, https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cumulative-SP-500-earnings-dividends-buybacks-and-rd-768x522.png 768w, https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cumulative-SP-500-earnings-dividends-buybacks-and-rd-400x272.png 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Data Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P Global&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qqWd&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/17/after-blowing-4-5-trillion-on-share-buybacks-corporate-america-airlines-boeing-other-culprits-want-taxpayer-fed-bailouts-for-these-shareholders/&quot;&gt;Wolf Richter&lt;/a&gt; recently noted, the four largest US airlines, the same companies that are now seeking a $50 billion taxpayer bailout, have spent $43.7 billion on buybacks since 2012. Boeing, which is asking for a $60 billion aerospace bailout, has spent $43 billion on buybacks over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quads-location quads-ad2&quot; id=&quot;quads-ad2&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4401495442679385&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2384793605&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1982, stock buybacks were considered market manipulation and were illegal under SEC rules. Whether buybacks should be outright illegal or not, they are a sign that a company thinks so little of its own products, services, and market potential that its capital should be diverted from growth and towards financial engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appropriate course of action for distressed companies that have engaged in share buybacks is that they should issue new shares to raise capital. If they can’t raise enough capital through share issuance, they should enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy and be restructured. If they cannot pull through a restructuring, they should go out of business. That’s how capitalism works.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The reckless, infinite scope of web browsers</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the first browser war between Netscape and Internet Explorer, web browsers have been using features as their primary means of competing with each other. This strategy of unlimited scope and perpetual feature creep is reckless, and has been allowed to go on for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used wget to download all 1,217 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/&quot;&gt;W3C specifications&lt;/a&gt; which have been published at the time of writing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, of which web browsers need to implement a substantial subset in order to provide a modern web experience. I ran a word count on all of these specifications. How complex would you guess the web is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total word count of the W3C specification catalogue is 114 million words at the time of writing. If you added the combined word counts of the C11, C++17, UEFI, USB 3.2, and POSIX specifications, all 8,754 published RFCs, and the combined word counts of everything on Wikipedia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels&quot;&gt;list of longest novels&lt;/a&gt;, you would be 12 million words short of the W3C specifications.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conclude that &lt;strong&gt;it is impossible to build a new web browser&lt;/strong&gt;. The complexity of the web is &lt;em&gt;obscene&lt;/em&gt;. The creation of a new web browser would be comparable in effort to the Apollo program or the Manhattan project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement the web correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the web securely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the web &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a bespoke browser engine with the intention of competing with Google or Mozilla is a fool’s errand. The last serious attempt to make a new browser, Servo, has become one part incubator for Firefox refactoring, one part playground for bored Mozilla engineers to mess with technology no one wants, and zero parts viable modern web browser. But WebVR is cool, right? Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this are obvious. Browsers are the most expensive piece of software a typical consumer computer runs. They’re infamous for using all of your RAM, pinning CPU and I/O, draining your battery, etc. &lt;em&gt;Web browsers are responsible for more than 8,000 CVEs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the monopoly created by the insurmountable task of building a competitive alternative, browsers have also been free to stop being the “user agent” and start being the agents of their creators instead. Firefox is filling up with ads, tracking, and mandatory plugins. Chrome is used as a means for Google to efficiently track your eyeballs and muscle anti-technologies like DRM and AMP into the ecosystem. The browser duopoly is only growing stronger, too, as Microsoft drops Edge and WebKit falls well behind its competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major projects are open source, and usually when an open-source project misbehaves, we’re able to to fork them to offer an alternative. But even this is an impossible task where web browsers are concerned. The number of W3C specifications grows at an average rate of 200 new specs per year, or about 4 million words, or about one POSIX every 4 to 6 months. How can a new team possibly keep up with this on top of implementing the outrageous scope web browsers already have &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser wars have been allowed to continue for far too long. They should have long ago focused on competing in terms of performance and stability, not in adding new web “features”. This is absolutely ridiculous, and it has to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple today also introduced the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. With a floating design with smooth angle adjustment, a backlit keyboard and trackpad, the Magic Keyboard delivers the best typing experience ever on iPad. The Magic Keyboard will be available for purchase in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new iPad Pro introduces advanced technologies never before available in mobile computing,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Combining the most advanced mobile display with powerful performance, pro cameras, pro audio, the breakthrough LiDAR Scanner and new Magic Keyboard with Trackpad, this is another huge leap forward for iPad. There’s no other device in the world like the new iPad Pro and we think our customers are going to love it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re making iPad even more capable and versatile by bringing trackpad support to iPadOS,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We carefully considered the best way to integrate trackpad use into a touch-first environment while retaining everything our customers know and love about iPad. We’re thrilled to bring this new way of interacting with iPad to the millions of people using iPadOS today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;pagebody-header&quot;&gt;Pro Performance with A12Z Bionic Chip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built for the most demanding tasks, like editing 4K video or designing 3D models, iPad Pro gets another performance boost with the new A12Z Bionic chip. The eight-core GPU in the A12Z Bionic, along with an enhanced thermal architecture and tuned performance controllers, gives iPad Pro the highest performance ever in an iPad. Combined with the eight-core CPU and the powerful Neural Engine, which enables next-generation apps, there’s no other chip that can offer the incredible performance found in the thin and light design of iPad Pro. With great battery life lasting up to 10 hours,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; faster Wi-Fi connectivity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and gigabit-class LTE that’s 60 percent faster&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with support for more LTE bands than any other tablet, customers can stay productive and creative all day.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Covid-19 projects looking for volunteers</title>
<link>https://helpwithcovid.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://helpwithcovid.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;We need to develop a strategic reserve of 1,000,000+ emergency ventilators ASAP. These don't need to be fancy medical ventilators, they just need to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;Step #1 is to crowdsource the best ventilator designs.&lt;br/&gt;Step #2 is to raise funding to deliver 1M+ ventilators.&lt;br/&gt;Step #3 is to rapidly build and ship 1M+ ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;Assuming containment has failed, the biggest cause of suffering and deaths from COVID-19 will be from a lack of ventilators. And any rationing of ventilators could trigger mass panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;There are ~160,000 ventilators in the US now. (See: http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/200214-VentilatorAvailability-factsheet.pdf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;The US alone needs &amp;gt;740,000 ventilators in a Spanish flu-level outbreak. (See: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;The CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has only ~10,000 ventilators. (See: CHS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;Ventilators are only valuable when they're matched to patients in need, so we need to dynamically track ventilator supply and demand by hospital and efficiently distribute additional ventilators to hospitals with the highest unmet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;We need to train thousands of people to operate these ventilators. One model showed that the supply of respiratory therapists, not the supply of ventilators, would be the limiting factor in providing respiratory care to patients in hospitals. (See: CHS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;The ideal device will be easy to transport, sanitize, and use in low- and no-power settings. It should cost less than $100/unit delivered at scale, and we need to be able to produce 1M+ units this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-2&quot;&gt;Calling the world's best engineers — help design a device that can save 1,000,000+ lives this year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>25,000-Year-Old Structure Built of the Bones of 60 Mammoths</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/60-mammoths-house-russia-180974426/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/60-mammoths-house-russia-180974426/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A jaw-dropping example of Ice Age architecture has been unearthed on Russia’s forest steppe: a huge, circular structure built with the bones of at least 60 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/photos/woolly-mammoth-mammuthus-primigenius&quot;&gt;woolly mammoths&lt;/a&gt;. But exactly why hunter-gatherers enduring the frigid realities of life 25,000 years ago would construct the 40-foot diameter building is a fascinating question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clearly a lot of time and effort went into building this structure so it was obviously important to the people that made it for some reason,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/apryor/&quot;&gt;Alexander Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter (U.K.). He is the lead author of a new study published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Antiquity&lt;/em&gt; describing the find at Kostenki, a place where many important Paleolithic sites lie clustered around the Don River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient builders did leave some clues. Fires once burned within the structure and food scraps, including vegetables, remain. Several pits containing mammoth bones lie just outside of the bone circle and may suggest food storage. “You obviously get a lot of meat from a mammoth,” Pryor said, “so the idea that there were food processing and food storage activities going on at the site is something that we want to investigate more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some, though, the grandeur of the structure suggests more than practical significance. “People have also speculated a lot about a likely ritual element to this and it’s really hard to say what that might have been,” Pryor adds. “Ritual is embedded in human lives in all sorts of ways. The fact they might have designed a structure of this type as part of both their ritual and their sustenance activities is very reasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;Location of the mammoth bone structure found in modern-day Russia&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/TcF5r_S1JtvP6leFFGDdUoDMYP8=/1024x596/filters:focal(548x281:549x282)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/d9/ff/d9ff2ece-c79e-4e7c-9ca1-f07b69d5f836/location_map_russia_-_kostenki_pryor_final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Location of the mammoth bone structure found in modern-day Russia&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Location of the mammoth bone structure found in modern-day Russia &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Courtesy of Pryor et. al.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammoth-bone buildings are well-known to archaeologists. Similar structures have been found across Eastern Europe, albeit on a much smaller scale, a few meters in diameter. These sites, including others found at Kostenki during the 1950s and '60s, date back as far as 22,000 years. Researchers have generally considered them to be dwellings or “mammoth houses” that helped their builders cope with frigid temperatures near the nadir of the last Ice Age. The new structure (first discovered at Kostenki in 2014) is 3,000 years older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a site!” says Penn State University anthropologist Pat Shipman, who wasn’t involved in the research. “I am completely intrigued as these remarkable finds differ meaningfully from previously discovered ones and can be more carefully and fully studied with modern techniques.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site stands out most obviously for its scale. “The size of the structure makes it exceptional among its kind, and building it would have been time-consuming,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://eubeads.wordpress.com/marjolein-bosch/&quot;&gt;Marjolein Bosch&lt;/a&gt;, a zooarchaeologist at the University of Cambridge. “This implies that it was meant to last, perhaps as a landmark, a meeting place, a place of ceremonial importance, or a place to return to when the conditions grew so harsh that shelter was needed,” Bosch was not involved with the new research on this “ truly exceptional find” but has personally visited the site. Indeed, the structure’s sheer size makes it an unlikely everyday home. “I cannot possibly imagine how they would have roofed over this structure,” Pryor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smaller mammoth houses feature more definite cooking hearths, and they contain the remains of reindeer, horse and fox, which suggests the people in them were living on whatever they could find in the area. The new mammoth bone structure lacks evidence of other animal remains. “It’s almost exclusively woolly mammoth remains and that is one of the interesting things about it,” Pryor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With no other animal bones, this doesn’t look much like a dwelling where people lived for a while,” Shipman added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the new structure is the first of its kind to yield evidence that its occupants burnt wood inside and not just bone. “It’s the first time anyone’s found large pieces of charcoal inside one of these structures. So it does show that trees were in the environment,” Pryor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree ring widths in the charcoal are narrow, suggesting the trees probably struggled to survive in that landscape. Previous studies suggested that even on the Ice Age’s arid steppes, coniferous trees would have endured in forests stretching along riversides like those close to Kostenki—a draw for people looking to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if people weren’t living in the structure, then why did they make fires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fire in the past can be seen as a tool much the same as chipped stone implements and worked bones are,” Bosch says. Fires provided heat and light, barbecued and roasted food, dried meat for storage and processed glues for stone-tipped tools. “Here, the fires were lit inside a structure and its use as a light source seems intuitive,” she says. “If the authors are correct in their assumption of its use as a place for food storage, it may also have been used to dry meat.” There may be ways to test these ideas. Finding drops of fat on the floor, for example, could show that meat was dried over the flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local diet also appears to have featured a smorgasbord of vegetables. By using water and sieve flotation techniques, the team discovered pieces of plant tissue among the charcoal. “This is the first time we have a plant food component discovered in any of these structures,” Pryor says. His team hasn’t identified specific species yet but notes that the tissues are like those found in modern roots and tubers such as carrots, potatoes or parsnips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astounding assemblage of bones from more than 60 mammoths raises the question: Where did they all come from? Scientists aren’t sure if the animals were hunted, scavenged from sites of mass deaths or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There must be something about the topography of the site that makes it a place where, over and over, herds of mammoths are coming through and can be killed or will be killed naturally, like at a river crossing,” says Penn State’s Pat Shipman. “I can imagine no way [these] people could possibly kill 60 mammoths at a time, because proboscideans (the order of mammals to which both mammoths and living elephants belong) are smart and catch on if members of their herd are being killed, even with modern automatic weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies of the mammoth bones will yield more clues about their source. Some were arranged in the same order and position as they were in the skeleton. “This means that the bones were brought to the site as body part which some soft tissue (skin, muscle, and tendons) still attached,” Bosch said. “Therefore, they must have been transported before carnivores had the chance to eat and clean the bones. This implies that the builders had early access to the mammoth remains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipman adds: “I want to know if the bones have been processed or transported or if we are looking at whole skeletons or carcasses piled up for future use. Moving a dead mammoth cannot have been easy even if it was largely de-fleshed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/jib5i2hI-Gh2PURTBklKsM3OScE=/1024x596/filters:focal(1592x1020:1593x1021)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/18/54/185423e4-02a4-4391-b358-fdd96c1320df/dsc_3212.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Researchers excavating the mammoth site.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the mammoths got here, their presence was crucial to the humans living in the area. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lioudmila_Iakovleva&quot;&gt;Lioudmila Lakovleva&lt;/a&gt; of the French National Centre for Scientific Research notes that “the complete settlement shows several mammoth bone dwellings, walls, enclosure, pits, working areas, hearths, dumping areas and butchering areas,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostenki was a focus for human settlement throughout the last ice age, Pryor said: “It’s a huge investment in this particular place in the landscape.” His team has some theories as to why. “There’s evidence that there were natural freshwater springs in the area which would have remained liquid throughout the year,” he says. “That warmed water would have drawn animals, including mammoth, and in turn attracted humans to the same spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the site raises many intriguing questions, Pryor said that it already tells us something certain about the people who built it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This project is giving us a real insight into how our human ancestors adapted to climate change, to the harshest parts of the last glacial cycle, and adapted to use the materials that they had around them,” he said. “It’s really a story of survival in the face of adversity.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ed Catmull and Pat Hanrahan Win Turing Award</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Pat Hanrahan was a young biophysics student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the 1980s when he decided to give up his work with microscopic insects and join a small group of computer scientists in their quest to make a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The group was led by Ed Catmull, a computer graphics pioneer who had become the chief technology officer at a new company called Pixar. The movie was “Toy Story,” the landmark animated feature released in fall of 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, said Dr. Hanrahan and Dr. Catmull would receive this year’s Turing Award for their work on three-dimensional computer graphics. Often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize, which will be split by the two pioneers of what is often called C.G.I., or computer-generated imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Their work changed not only animated movies but Hollywood special effects, video games, and virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Both Pat and Ed have had a pervasive influence on multiple industries, both through their technical contributions and their leadership,” said David A. Price, the author of “The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company.” “Many of the foundational techniques in 3-D computer graphics came from Ed or from people he has led.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When they started, the young researchers hoped to make a full-length feature entirely from images generated by a computer. Dr. Hanrahan did not think they would reach this goal, but he felt they might as well get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I didn’t think it would be possible in my lifetime, but I could spend the rest of my life working on it,” Dr. Hanrahan, 64, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After joining Pixar in 1986, he oversaw the development of a graphics system called RenderMan, building on more than a decade of work by Dr. Catmull and others. RenderMan played a key role in the making of “Toy Story” and the many Pixar features that followed, generating increasingly realistic 3-D animation. But its effect on the movie business extended well beyond characters like Woody and Buzz Lightyear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the late 1980s, Dr. Hanrahan and his Pixar colleagues licensed RenderMan to other movie makers. They also released the RenderMan Shading language — the computer language that allowed anyone to modify the technology. As a result, the technology improved much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even before the release of “Toy Story,” RenderMan was used to create special effects for seminal films such as James Cameron’s “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” and Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park.” Later, it fed the creation of movies like “Avatar,” “Titanic” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the early 1970s, Dr. Catmull was a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah under one of the founding fathers of computer graphics, Ivan Sutherland. When he moved to the New York Institute of Technology on Long Island and later Lucasfilm, the Northern California movie production company that made the “Star Wars” films, he brought an academic’s sensibility, encouraging his engineers to share their work with the wider community of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I had such a great time at Utah,” Dr. Catmull, 74, said in an interview. “I wanted to take a lot of the same principles and apply them to the next place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At Pixar, that attitude continued. Though Pixar was owned by Steve Jobs — whose belief in corporate secrecy became famous the world over as he built his other company, Apple — Pixar engineers like Dr. Hanrahan regularly published academic papers describing the underlying details of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Almost every project was owned by the community of computer scientists,” said Michael Rubin, the author of “Droidmaker: George Lucas and the Digital Revolution,” who worked alongside Dr. Catmull at Lucasfilm. “A product like RenderMan was not just something made by Pixar, for Pixar. It belonged to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This accelerated the development of software and hardware like the specialized computer chips needed to generate 3-D images. These graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, drove the 3-D computer games that became ubiquitous in the 1990s and 2000s. Later, they played an essential role in the design of virtual reality and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/technology/nvidia-chipmaker.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence technology&lt;/a&gt;, including the techniques that underpinned self-driving cars, facial recognition services and talking digital assistants like Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Much of this work was driven by new computer languages that allowed anyone to build new software for these chips — languages similar to the one that fed RenderMan. They also could trace their roots back to Dr. Hanrahan. After leaving Pixar in 1989, he continued his research as a professor at Princeton and Stanford, where he and his students helped develop those languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Catmull eventually became the president of Pixar, and after the Walt Disney Company acquired Pixar in 2006, he helped remake animation at the nearly 80-year-old movie studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There is no one who has had such a profound and widespread effect on computer graphics as Ed Catmull,” Mr. Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
