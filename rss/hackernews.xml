<title>You Only Need to Test with 5 Users (2000)</title>
<link>https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people think that usability is very costly and complex and that user tests should be reserved for the rare web design project with a huge budget and a lavish time schedule. Not true. Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earlier research, Tom Landauer and I showed that the number of usability problems found in a usability test with &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; users is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; (1-(1- &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; ) &lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is the total number of usability problems in the design and &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; is the proportion of usability problems discovered while testing a single user. The typical value of &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; is 31%, averaged across a large number of projects we studied. Plotting the curve for &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; =31% gives the following result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Increase in proportion of usability problems found by number of test users&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/alertbox/20000319-user-testing-diminshing-returns-curve.gif&quot; title=&quot;Diminishing returns for usability testing, as more and more users are tested. The curve bends around 5 users, which is the recommended number of test participants.&quot; width=&quot;631&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most striking truth of the curve is that &lt;strong&gt;zero users give zero insights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you collect data from a &lt;strong&gt;single test user&lt;/strong&gt;, your insights shoot up and you have already learned almost a third of all there is to know about the usability of the design. The difference between zero and even a little bit of data is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you test the &lt;strong&gt;second user&lt;/strong&gt;, you will discover that this person does some of the same things as the first user, so there is some overlap in what you learn. People are definitely different, so there will also be something new that the second user does that you did not observe with the first user. So the second user adds some amount of new insight, but not nearly as much as the first user did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;third user&lt;/strong&gt; will do many things that you already observed with the first user or with the second user and even some things that you have already seen twice. Plus, of course, the third user will generate a small amount of new data, even if not as much as the first and the second user did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you &lt;strong&gt;add more and more users, you learn less and less&lt;/strong&gt; because you will keep seeing the same things again and again. There is no real need to keep observing the same thing multiple times, and you will be very motivated to go back to the drawing board and redesign the site to eliminate the usability problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fifth user, you are wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iterative Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve clearly shows that you need to &lt;strong&gt;test with at least 15 users to discover all the usability problems&lt;/strong&gt; in the design. So why do I recommend testing with a much smaller number of users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that it is better to distribute your budget for &lt;a class=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/parallel-and-iterative-design/&quot; title=&quot;Alertbox: Parallel &amp;amp; Iterative Design + Competitive Testing = High Usability&quot;&gt;user testing across many small tests&lt;/a&gt; instead of blowing everything on a single, elaborate study. Let us say that you do have the funding to recruit 15 representative customers and have them test your design. Great. &lt;strong&gt;Spend this budget on 3 studies with 5 users each!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to run multiple tests because the real goal of usability engineering is to improve the design and not just to document its weaknesses. After the first study with five participants has found 85% of the usability problems, you will want to fix these problems in a redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the new design, you need to &lt;strong&gt;test again&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though I said that the redesign should &quot;fix&quot; the problems found in the first study, the truth is that you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that the new design overcomes the problems. But since nobody can design the perfect user interface, there is no guarantee that the new design does in fact fix the problems. A second test will discover whether the fixes worked or whether they didn't. Also, in introducing a new design, there is always the risk of introducing a new usability problem, even if the old one did get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the second study with 5 users will discover most of the remaining 15% of the original usability problems that were not found in the first round of testing. (There will still be 2% of the original problems left — they will have to wait until the third study to be identified.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the second study will be able to &lt;strong&gt;probe deeper into the usability of the fundamental structure&lt;/strong&gt; of the site, assessing issues like information architecture, task flow, and match with user needs. These important issues are often obscured in initial studies where the users are stumped by stupid surface-level usability problems that prevent them from really digging into the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the second study will both serve as quality assurance of the outcome of the first study and help provide deeper insights as well. The second study will always lead to a new (but smaller) list of usability problems to fix in a redesign. And the same insight applies to this redesign: not all the fixes will work; some deeper issues will be uncovered after cleaning up the interface. Thus, a third study is needed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate user experience is improved much more by 3 studies with 5 users each than by a single monster study with 15 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Test With a Single User?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that 15 studies with a single user would be even better than 3 studies with 5 users. The curve does show that we learn much more from the first user than from any subsequent users, so why keep going? Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is always a risk of being misled by the spurious behavior of a single person who may perform certain actions by accident or in an unrepresentative manner. Even 3 users are enough to get an idea of the diversity in user behavior and insight into what's unique and what can be generalized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;old&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/guerrilla-hci/&quot; title=&quot;Jakob Nielsen paper: 'Guerrilla HCI: Using Discount Usability Engineering to Penetrate the Intimidation Barrier'&quot;&gt;cost-benefit analysis of user testing&lt;/a&gt; provides the optimal ratio around 3 or 5 users, depending on the style of testing. There is always a fixed initial cost associated with planning and running a study: it is better to depreciate this start-up cost across the findings from multiple users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Test More Users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to test additional users when a website has &lt;strong&gt;several highly distinct groups of users&lt;/strong&gt;. The formula only holds for comparable users who will be using the site in fairly similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, for example, you have a site that will be used by both children and parents, then the two groups of users will have sufficiently different behavior that it becomes necessary to test with people from both groups. The same would be true for a system aimed at connecting purchasing agents with sales staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the groups of users are very different, there will still be great similarities between the observations from the two groups. All the users are human, after all. Also, many of the usability problems are related to the fundamental way people interact with the Web and the influence from other sites on user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In testing multiple groups of disparate users, you don't need to include as many members of each group as you would in a single test of a single group of users. The overlap between observations will ensure a better outcome from testing a smaller number of people in each group. I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3–4 users from each category if testing two groups of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 users from each category if testing three or more groups of users (you always want at least 3 users to ensure that you have covered the diversity of behavior within the group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;NEW DELHI — It was 10 a.m. on a muggy Delhi day, and it was time for space class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like so many other middle schoolers, Veronica Sodhi, a 12-year-old with big dreams, said space class was her favorite subject, but on Friday there was something even more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;India was all set to send a robotic rover to rumble around the south pole of the moon, a huge leap forward for its space program. The rocket was to launch at 2:51 a.m. Monday and the anticipation was stoking national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Indian children sent good luck YouTube messages to the national space agency; V.I.P.’s were converging on the launch site in a remote coastal area near Chennai; the little six-wheeled rover was crawling across the front pages of all the newspapers; and telecasters were tapping the patriotism with special broadcasts on “India’s Greatest Space Adventure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the last moment, the launch was delayed because of a technical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But on Friday, at the K.R. Mangalam World School near New Delhi, a place for the children of the upper middle class — there’s a roller rink on the ground floor — Veronica and her classmates were pumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Children,” asked Harjeet Kaur, the space class teacher, “why did we name this mission ‘Chandrayaan’?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Veronica shot up from her desk so fast she nearly knocked over the chair behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Because-it-means-moon-and-vehicle,” she said in one breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Everybody clap for her,” the teacher said. “Is there another country that has sent a mission to the moon’s south pole?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“No!” the students shouted back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We are all proud Indians, right, students?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Yes, ma’am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Really? I can’t hear you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“YES, MA’AM!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It would be really cool to walk on the moon,” Veronica whispered a little while later. “I mean, kind of like hiking but &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A moon mission is a bold move for any country, but especially for one that has hundreds of millions of people still stuck in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But this is the puzzle of India. It is also a hotbed of modernity, a fount of scientific and engineering prowess. Its software developers are known as some of the world’s greatest, and each year its universities pump out thousands of highly talented scientists and engineers, experts in the most cutting-edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Space suits it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A big reason Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/world/asia/india-modi-election-polls.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;won a thumping re-election in May&lt;/a&gt;, is so popular is that he has been pushing a brawnier, more assertive India, hungry to claim its place as a superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Just weeks before the election began — and commentators found the timing a little suspicious — Mr. Modi announced that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/world/asia/india-weather-satellite-missle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;India had just shot down a satellite&lt;/a&gt; whizzing 17,000 miles per hour 150 miles above Earth. Few countries can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This isn’t even India’s first moon mission. In 2008, the lunar probe Chandrayaan I didn’t land, but discovered water molecules on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The moon is definitely enjoying &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/science/nasa-moon-apollo-artemis.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a bit of a renaissance&lt;/a&gt; on Earth. China is working on its own mission to the moon’s south pole. Scientists believe there might be &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/41554-water-ice-moon-surface-confirmed.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot of water ice&lt;/a&gt; down there as well as Helium-3, a future energy source thought to be abundant on our little neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many Indians feel this mission, which will unfold more than 200,000 miles away, is a turning point in their country’s history. They use almost the exact same words to describe Chandrayaan’s importance: “We will now be the fourth space power!” They follow after the United States, Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“India would like their little space in space,” said Sunita Nagpal, the principal of the K.R. Mangalam school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To help raise the next generation of astronauts, and go beyond the standard government science curriculum (which one private school principal snobbily dismissed as written for a rickshaw puller’s son), many private schools have looked for new ways to teach space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many schools do not have their own space teachers and hire instructors from Space India, which even runs overnight space camp at several locations far from any cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This week, its lessons revolved around the moon and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/science/chandrayaan-2-india-moon.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the Chandrayaan-2 mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The entire mission costs less than $150 million. The orbiter will conserve fuel by making ever-widening orbits around the Earth before being captured by the moon’s gravity and pulled into lunar orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This takes much longer than the straight shot made by the Apollo missions, which cost billions (the fact that humans were along for the ride wasn’t cheap either). Chandrayaan’s rover won’t be rumbling across the moon’s surface until September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s hard to overlook the synergy with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/apollo-11-moon-landing?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission&lt;/a&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“But this is just a coincidence,” said Vivek Singh, a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization, India’s version of NASA. “We were late.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Indians wanted to launch two or three years ago, with a Russian rover, but when the Russians backed out they decided to build their own, which took some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The hardest part, everyone agrees, will be the soft landing. The plan is for a landing craft to lower itself from the orbiter and gently plop itself down on the powdery moon surface. Then the little six-wheel rover (which weighs about 60 pounds) will pop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/science/israel-moon-lander-spaceil.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the Israelis tried to pull off a similar moon mission&lt;/a&gt; in April, it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/israel-moon-landing-beresheet.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;didn’t go so well&lt;/a&gt;. Communications sizzled out, leaving people gathered outside the control room with tears in their eyes. The lander had crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To appreciate these difficulties, the students in space class at K.R. Mangalam school were asked to make lunar landers out of Styrofoam bowls, with folded paper taped to the side to act as a shock absorber. The trick was to drop the bowls from their desks and have them land without the astronaut — a pen cap — falling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At space class at another Delhi-area school, students built rockets out of plastic soda bottles. The style of teaching was the same, a very cheerful Socratic method, with another Space India instructor, Heena Bhatia, standing in front of the class shouting out questions and waiting for a rapid delivery of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You know the basic parts of the rocket? Who will tell me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One boy stood up and blurted out the answers like verbal bullets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Sir will be giving you materials to make your own rocket,” the teacher said, gesturing to a man with tattooed forearms deep in concentration in taping together little fins — he was a Space India assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;All children dream of the stars. But in New Delhi, it’s often hard to see any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That’s because the air pollution is so bad and the city lights are so bright. The result is a smudgy, opaque night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“But up on the moon, it will be so beautiful,” Veronica said, her eyes glowing with that special 12-year-old light. “It will be so dark and quiet. There will be so many stars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I don’t know why I’ve always had this interest in the moon,” she said. “But I do. I want to be close to it, not on YouTube, not on the internet. I’ve always dreamed of being an astronaut. I want to make my India proud of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Portugal’s radical drugs policy is working (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen the drugs came, they hit all at once. It was the 80s, and by the time one in 10 people had slipped into the depths of heroin use – bankers, university students, carpenters, socialites, miners – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/portugal&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; was in a state of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Álvaro Pereira was working as a family doctor in Olhão in southern Portugal. “People were injecting themselves in the street, in public squares, in gardens,” he told me. “At that time, not a day passed when there wasn’t a robbery at a local business, or a mugging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crisis began in the south. The 80s were a prosperous time in Olhão, a fishing town 31 miles west of the Spanish border. Coastal waters filled fishermen’s nets from the Gulf of Cádiz to Morocco, tourism was growing, and currency flowed throughout the southern Algarve region. But by the end of the decade, heroin began washing up on Olhão’s shores. Overnight, Pereira’s beloved slice of the Algarve coast became one of the drug capitals of Europe: one in every 100 Portuguese was battling a problematic heroin addiction at that time, but the number was even higher in the south. Headlines in the local press raised the alarm about overdose deaths and rising crime. The rate of HIV infection in Portugal became the highest in the European Union. Pereira recalled desperate patients and families beating a path to his door, terrified, bewildered, begging for help. “I got involved,” he said, “only because I was ignorant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, there was a lot of ignorance back then. Forty years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/great-escape-that-changed-africas-future&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;authoritarian rule&lt;/a&gt; under the regime established by António Salazar in 1933 had suppressed education, weakened institutions and lowered the school-leaving age, in a strategy intended to keep the population docile. The country was closed to the outside world; people missed out on the experimentation and mind-expanding culture of the 1960s. When the regime ended abruptly in a military coup in 1974, Portugal was suddenly opened to new markets and influences. Under the old regime, Coca-Cola was banned and owning a cigarette lighter required a licence. When marijuana and then heroin began flooding in, the country was utterly unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira tackled the growing wave of addiction the only way he knew how: one patient at a time. A student in her 20s who still lived with her parents might have her family involved in her recovery; a middle-aged man, estranged from his wife and living on the street, faced different risks and needed a different kind of support. Pereira improvised, calling on institutions and individuals in the community to lend a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, nearly two decades into Pereira’s accidental specialisation in addiction, Portugal became the first country to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit substances. Rather than being arrested, those caught with a personal supply might be given a warning, a small fine, or told to appear before a local commission – a doctor, a lawyer and a social worker – about treatment, harm reduction, and the support services that were available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opioid crisis soon stabilised, and the ensuing years saw dramatic drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates. HIV infection plummeted from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million to 4.2 cases per million in 2015. The data behind these changes has been studied and cited as evidence by harm-reduction movements around the globe. It’s misleading, however, to credit these positive results entirely to a change in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal’s remarkable recovery, and the fact that it has held steady through several changes in government – including conservative leaders who would have preferred to return to the US-style war on drugs – could not have happened without an enormous cultural shift, and a change in how the country viewed drugs, addiction – and itself. In many ways, the law was merely a reflection of transformations that were already happening in clinics, in pharmacies and around kitchen tables across the country. The official policy of decriminalisation made it far easier for a broad range of services (health, psychiatry, employment, housing etc) that had been struggling to pool their resources and expertise, to work together more effectively to serve their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language began to shift, too. Those who had been referred to sneeringly as &lt;em&gt;drogados&lt;/em&gt; (junkies) – became known more broadly, more sympathetically, and more accurately, as “people who use drugs” or “people with addiction disorders”. This, too, was crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Portugal stabilised its opioid crisis, but it didn’t make it disappear. While drug-related death, incarceration and infection rates plummeted, the country still had to deal with the health complications of long-term problematic drug use. Diseases including hepatitis C, cirrhosis and liver cancer are a burden on a health system that is still struggling to recover from recession and cutbacks. In this way, Portugal’s story serves as a warning of challenges yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/opinion/sunday/portugal-drug-decriminalization.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;enthusiastic international reactions&lt;/a&gt; to Portugal’s success, local harm-reduction advocates have been frustrated by what they see as stagnation and inaction since decriminalisation came into effect. They criticise the state for dragging its feet on establishing supervised injection sites and drug consumption facilities; for failing to make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/16/opioid-overdose-naloxone-pharmaceutical-price-gouging&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;anti-overdose medication naloxone&lt;/a&gt; more readily available; for not implementing needle-exchange programmes in prisons. Where, they ask, is the courageous spirit and bold leadership that pushed the country to decriminalise drugs in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n the early days of Portugal’s panic, when Pereira’s beloved Olhão began falling apart in front of him, the state’s first instinct was to attack. Drugs were denounced as evil, drug users were demonised, and proximity to either was criminally and spiritually punishable. The Portuguese government launched a series of national anti-drug campaigns that were less “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/nancy-reagan-drugs-just-say-no-dare-program-opioid-epidemic&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Just Say No&lt;/a&gt;” and more “Drugs Are Satan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informal treatment approaches and experiments were rushed into use throughout the country, as doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists worked independently to deal with the flood of drug-dependency disorders at their doors, sometimes risking ostracism or arrest to do what they believed was best for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, in the north of the country, psychiatrist Eduíno Lopes pioneered a methadone programme at the Centro da Boavista in Porto. Lopes was the first doctor in continental &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; to experiment with substitution therapy, flying in methadone powder from Boston, under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, rather than the Ministry of Health. His efforts met with a vicious public backlash and the disapproval of his peers, who considered methadone therapy nothing more than state-sponsored drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lisbon, Odette Ferreira, an experienced pharmacist and pioneering HIV researcher, started an unofficial needle-exchange programme to address the growing Aids crisis. She received death threats from drug dealers, and legal threats from politicians. Ferreira – who is now in her 90s, and still has enough swagger to carry off long fake eyelashes and red leather at a midday meeting – started giving away clean syringes in the middle of Europe’s biggest open-air drug market, in the Casal Ventoso neighbourhood of Lisbon. She collected donations of clothing, soap, razors, condoms, fruit and sandwiches, and distributed them to users. When dealers reacted with hostility, she snapped back: “Don’t mess with me. You do your job, and I’ll do mine.” She then bullied the Portuguese Association of Pharmacies into running the country’s – and indeed the world’s – first national needle-exchange programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flurry of expensive private clinics and free, faith-based facilities emerged, promising detoxes and miracle cures, but the first public drug-treatment centre run by the Ministry of Health – the Centro das Taipas in Lisbon – did not begin operating until 1987. Strapped for resources in Olhão, Pereira sent a few patients for treatment, although he did not agree with the abstinence-based approach used at Taipas. “First you take away the drug, and then, with psychotherapy, you plug up the crack,” said Pereira. There was no scientific evidence to show that this would work – and it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also sent patients to Lopes’s methadone programme in Porto, and found that some responded well. But Porto was at the other end of the country. He wanted to try methadone for his patients, but the Ministry of Health hadn’t yet approved it for use. To get around that, Pereira sometimes asked a nurse to sneak methadone to him in the boot of his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira’s work treating patients for addiction eventually caught the attention of the Ministry of Health. “They heard there was a crazy man in the Algarve who was working on his own,” he said, with a slow smile. Now 68, he is sprightly and charming, with an athletic build, thick and wavy white hair that bounces when he walks, a gravelly drawl and a bottomless reserve of warmth. “They came down to find me at the clinic and proposed that I open a treatment centre,” he said. He invited a colleague from at a family practice in the next town over to join him – a young local doctor named João Goulão.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goulão was a 20-year-old medical student when he was offered his first hit of heroin. He declined because he didn’t know what it was. By the time he finished school, got his licence and began practising medicine at a health centre in the southern city of Faro, it was everywhere. Like Pereira, he accidentally ended up specialising in treating drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two young colleagues joined forces to open southern Portugal’s first CAT in 1988. (These kinds of centres have used different names and acronyms over the years, but are still commonly referred to as &lt;em&gt;Centros de Atendimento a Toxicodependentes&lt;/em&gt;, or CATs.) Local residents were vehemently opposed, and the doctors were improvising treatments as they went along. The following month, Pereira and Goulão opened a second CAT in Olhão, and other family doctors opened more in the north and central regions, forming a loose network. It had become clear to a growing number of practitioners that the most effective response to addiction had to be personal, and rooted in communities. Treatment was still small-scale, local and largely ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first official call to change Portugal’s drug laws came from Rui Pereira, a former constitutional court judge who undertook an overhaul of the penal code in 1996. He found the practice of jailing people for taking drugs to be counterproductive and unethical. “My thought right off the bat was that it wasn’t legitimate for the state to punish users,” he told me in his office at the University of Lisbon’s school of law. At that time, about half of the people in prison were there for drug-related reasons, and the epidemic, he said, was thought to be “an irresolvable problem”. He recommended that drug use be discouraged without imposing penalties, or further alienating users. His proposals weren’t immediately adopted, but they did not go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, after 10 years of running the CAT in Faro, Goulão was invited to help design and lead a national drug strategy. He assembled a team of experts to study potential solutions to Portugal’s drug problem. The resulting recommendations, including the full decriminalisation of drug use, were presented in 1999, approved by the council of ministers in 2000, and a new national plan of action came into effect in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Goulão is Portugal’s drug czar. He has been the lodestar throughout eight alternating conservative and progressive administrations; through heated standoffs with lawmakers and lobbyists; through shifts in scientific understanding of addiction and in cultural tolerance for drug use; through austerity cuts, and through a global policy climate that only very recently became slightly less hostile. Goulão is also decriminalisation’s busiest global ambassador. He travels almost non-stop, invited again and again to present the successes of Portugal’s harm-reduction experiment to authorities around the world, from Norway to Brazil, which are dealing with desperate situations in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These social movements take time,” Goulão told me. “The fact that this happened across the board in a conservative society such as ours had some impact.” If the heroin epidemic had affected only Portugal’s lower classes or racialised minorities, and not the middle or upper classes, he doubts the conversation around drugs, addiction and harm reduction would have taken shape in the same way. “There was a point whenyou could not find a single Portuguese family that wasn’t affected. Every family had their addict, or addicts. This was universal in a way that the society felt: ‘We have to do something.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal’s policy rests on three pillars: one, that there’s no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs; two, that an individual’s unhealthy relationship with drugs often conceals frayed relationships with loved ones, with the world around them, and with themselves; and three, that the eradication of all drugs is an impossible goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The national policy is to treat each individual differently,” Goulão told me. “The secret is for us to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; drop-in centre called IN-Mouraria sits unobtrusively in a lively, rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood of Lisbon, a longtime enclave of marginalised communities. From 2pm to 4pm, the centre provides services to undocumented migrants and refugees; from 5pm to 8pm, they open their doors to drug users. A staff of psychologists, doctors and peer support workers (themselves former drug users) offer clean needles, pre-cut squares of foil, crack kits, sandwiches, coffee, clean clothing, toiletries, rapid HIV testing, and consultations – all free and anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day I visited, young people stood around waiting for HIV test results while others played cards, complained about police harassment, tried on outfits, traded advice on living situations, watched movies and gave pep talks to one another. They varied in age, religion, ethnicity and gender identity, and came from all over the country and all over the world. When a slender, older man emerged from the bathroom, unrecognisable after having shaved his beard off, an energetic young man who had been flipping through magazines threw up his arms and cheered. He then turned to a quiet man sitting on my other side, his beard lush and dark hair curling from under his cap, and said: “What about you? Why don’t you go shave off that beard? You can’t give up on yourself, man. That’s when it’s all over.” The bearded man cracked a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my visits over the course of a month, I got to know some of the peer support workers, including João, a compact man with blue eyes who was rigorous in going over the details and nuances of what I was learning. João wanted to be sure I understood their role at the drop-in centre was not to force anyone to stop using, but to help minimise the risks users were exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our objective is not to steer people to treatment – they have to want it,” he told me. But even when they do want to stop using, he continued, having support workers accompany them to appointments and treatment facilities can feel like a burden on the user – and if the treatment doesn’t go well, there is the risk that that person will feel too ashamed to return to the drop-in centre. “Then we lose them, and that’s not what we want to do,” João said. “I want them to come back when they relapse.” Failure was part of the treatment process, he told me. And he would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;João is a marijuana-legalisation activist, open about being HIV-positive, and after being absent for part of his son’s youth, he is delighting in his new role as a grandfather. He had stopped doing speedballs (mixtures of cocaine and opiates) after several painful, failed treatment attempts, each more destructive than the last. He long used cannabis as a form of therapy – methadone did not work for him, nor did any of the inpatient treatment programmes he tried – but the cruel hypocrisy of decriminalisation meant that although smoking weed was not a criminal offence, purchasing it was. His last and worst relapse came when he went to buy marijuana from his usual dealer and was told: “I don’t have that right now, but I do have some good cocaine.” João said no thanks and drove away, but soon found himself heading to a cash machine, and then back to the dealer. After this relapse, he embarked on a new relationship, and started his own business. At one point he had more than 30 employees. Then the financial crisis hit. “Clients weren’t paying, and creditors started knocking on my door,” he told me. “Within six months I had burned through everything I had built up over four or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mornings, I followed the centre’s street teams out to the fringes of Lisbon. I met Raquel and Sareia – their slim forms swimming in the large hi-vis vests they wear on their shifts – who worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://crescer.org/en/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Crescer na Maior&lt;/a&gt;, a harm-reduction NGO. Six times a week, they loaded up a large white van with drinking water, wet wipes, gloves, boxes of tinfoil and piles of state-issued drug kits: green plastic pouches with single-use servings of filtered water, citric acid, a small metal tray for cooking, gauze, filter and a clean syringe. Portugal does not yet have any supervised injection sites (although there is legislation to allow them, several attempts to open one have come to nothing), so, Raquel and Sareia told me, they go out to the open-air sites where they know people go to buy and use. Both are trained psychologists, but out in the streets they are known simply as the “needle girls”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good afternoon!” Raquel called out cheerily, as we walked across a seemingly abandoned lot in an area called Cruz Vermelha. “Street team!” People materialised from their hiding places like some strange version of whack-a-mole, poking their heads out from the holes in the wall where they had gone to smoke or shoot up. “My needle girls,” one woman cooed to them tenderly. “How are you, my loves?” Most made polite conversation, updating the workers on their health struggles, love lives, immigration woes or housing needs. One woman told them she would be going back to Angola to deal with her mother’s estate, that she was looking forward to the change of scenery. Another man told them he had managed to get his online girlfriend’s visa approved for a visit. “Does she know you’re still using?” Sareia asked. The man looked sheepish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I start methadone tomorrow,” another man said proudly. He was accompanied by his beaming girlfriend, and waved a warm goodbye to the girls as they handed him a square of foil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the foggy northern city of Porto, peer support workers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurohrn.eu/index.php/drug-user-organisation-survey?id=44:portugal&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Caso&lt;/a&gt; – an association run by and for drug users and former users, the only one of its kind in Portugal – meet every week at a noisy cafe. They come here every Tuesday morning to down espressos, fresh pastries and toasted sandwiches, and to talk out the challenges, debate drug policy (which, a decade and a half after the law came into effect, was still confusing for many) and argue, with the warm rowdiness that is characteristic of people in the northern region. When I asked them what they thought of Portugal’s move to treat drug users as sick people in need of help, rather than as criminals, they scoffed. “Sick? We don’t say ‘sick’ up here. We’re not sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told this again and again in the north: thinking of drug addiction simply in terms of health and disease was too reductive. Some people are able to use drugs for years without any major disruption to their personal or professional relationships. It only became a problem, they told me, when it became a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caso was supported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apdes.pt/en/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Apdes&lt;/a&gt;, a development NGO with a focus on harm reduction and empowerment, including programmes geared toward recreational users. Their award-winning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apdes.pt/en/services/health-harm-reduction-human-rights/check!n.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Check!n project&lt;/a&gt; has for years set up shop at festivals, bars and parties to test substances for dangers. I was told more than once that if drugs were legalised, not just decriminalised, then these substances would be held to the same rigorous quality and safety standards as food, drink and medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n spite of Portugal’s tangible results, other countries have been reluctant to follow. The Portuguese began seriously considering decriminalisation in 1998, immediately following the first UN General Assembly Special Session on the Global Drug Problem (UNgass). High-level UNgass meetings are convened every 10 years to set drug policy for all member states, addressing trends in addiction, infection, money laundering, trafficking and cartel violence. At the first session – for which the slogan was “A drug-free world: we can do it” – Latin American member states pressed for a radical rethinking of the war on drugs, but every effort to examine alternative models (such as decriminalisation) was blocked. By the time of the next session, in 2008, worldwide drug use and violence related to the drug trade had vastly increased. An extraordinary session &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/un-summit-global-war-drugs-agreement-approved&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;was held last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;largely a disappointment&lt;/a&gt; – the outcome document didn’t mention “harm reduction” once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that letdown, 2016 produced a number of promising other developments: Chile and Australia opened their first medical cannabis clubs; following the lead of several others, four more US states introduced medical cannabis, and four more legalised recreational cannabis; Denmark opened the world’s largest drug consumption facility, and France opened its first; South Africa proposed legalising medical cannabis; Canada &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/canada-legislation-decriminalize-recreational-cannabis-weed-marijuana&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;outlined a plan&lt;/a&gt; to legalise recreational cannabis nationally and to open more supervised injection sites; and Ghana announced it would decriminalise all personal drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;What Britain could learn from Portugal's drugs policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change in global attitudes and policy has been the momentum behind cannabis legalisation. Local activists have pressed Goulão to take a stance on regulating cannabis and legalising its sale in Portugal; for years, he has responded that the time wasn’t right. Legalising a single substance would call into question the foundation of Portugal’s drug and harm-reduction philosophy. If the drugs aren’t the problem, if the problem is the relationship with drugs, if there’s no such thing as a hard or a soft drug, and if all illicit substances are to be treated equally, he argued, then shouldn’t all drugs be legalised and regulated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive international cultural shifts in thinking about drugs and addiction are needed to make way for decriminalisation and legalisation globally. In the US, the White House has remained reluctant to address what drug policy reform advocates have termed an “addiction to punishment”. But if conservative, isolationist, Catholic Portugal could transform into a country where same-sex marriage and abortion are legal, and where drug use is decriminalised, a broader shift in attitudes seems possible elsewhere. But, as the harm-reduction adage goes: one has to want the change in order to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen Pereira first opened the CAT in Olhão, he faced vociferous opposition from residents; they worried that with more &lt;em&gt;drogados&lt;/em&gt; would come more crime. But the opposite happened. Months later, one neighbour came to ask Pereira’s forgiveness. She hadn’t realised it at the time, but there had been three drug dealers on her street; when their local clientele stopped buying, they packed up and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAT building itself is a drab, brown two-storey block, with offices upstairs and an open waiting area, bathrooms, storage and clinics down below. The doors open at 8.30am, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Patients wander in throughout the day for appointments, to chat, to kill time, to wash, or to pick up their weekly supply of methadone doses. They tried to close the CAT for Christmas Day one year, but patients asked that it stay open. For some, estranged from loved ones and adrift from any version of home, this is the closest thing they’ve got to community and normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about administering methadone,” Pereira told me. “You have to maintain a relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a back room, rows of little canisters with banana-flavoured methadone doses were lined up, each labelled with a patient’s name and information. The Olhão CAT regularly services about 400 people, but that number can double during the summer months, when seasonal workers and tourists come to town. Anyone receiving treatment elsewhere in the country, or even outside Portugal, can have their prescription sent over to the CAT, making the Algarve an ideal harm-reduction holiday destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch at a restaurant owned by a former CAT employee, the doctor took me to visit another of his projects – a particular favourite. His decades of working with addiction disorders had taught him some lessons, and he poured his accumulated knowledge into designing a special treatment facility on the outskirts of Olhão: the Unidade de Desabituação, or Dishabituation Centre. Several such UDs, as they are known, have opened in other regions of the country, but this centre was developed to cater to the particular circumstances and needs of the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;A man receives clean syringes after being given methadone at a clinic in Lisbon.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9c0b00a938a95b16610cef6a08c99eb620df4/0_0_5906_4198/master/5906.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9287a8f6ab6f1cbe0d2fcf97e074e61a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pereira stepped down as director some years ago, but his replacement asked him to stay on to help with day-to-day operations. Pereira should be retired by now – indeed, he tried to – but Portugal is suffering from an overall shortage of health professionals in the public system, and not enough young doctors are stepping into this specialisation. As his colleagues elsewhere in the country grow closer to their own retirements, there’s a growing sense of dread that there is no one to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those of us from the Algarve always had a bit of a different attitude from our colleagues up north,” Pereira told me. “I don’t treat patients. They treat themselves. My function is to help them to make the changes they need to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thank goodness there is only one change to make, he deadpanned as we pulled into the centre’s parking lot: “You need to change almost everything.” He cackled at his own joke and stepped out of his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass doors at the entrance slid open to a facility that was bright and clean without feeling overwhelmingly institutional. Doctors’ and administrators’ offices were up a sweeping staircase ahead. Women at the front desk nodded their hellos, and Pereira greeted them warmly: “Good afternoon, my darlings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Olhão centre was built for just under €3m (£2.6m), publicly funded, and opened to its first patients nine years ago. This facility, like the others, is connected to a web of health and social rehabilitation services. It can house up to 14 people at once: treatments are free, available on referral from a doctor or therapist, and normally last between eight and 14 days. When people first arrive, they put all of their personal belongings – photos, mobile phones, everything – into storage, retrievable on departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe in the old maxim: ‘No news is good news,’” explained Pereira. “We don’t do this to punish them but to protect them.” Memories can be triggering, and sometimes families, friends and toxic relationships can be enabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left there were intake rooms and a padded isolation room, with clunky security cameras propped up in every corner. Patients each had their own suites – simple, comfortable and private. To the right, there was a “colour” room, with a pottery wheel, recycled plastic bottles, paints, egg cartons, glitter and other craft supplies. In another room, coloured pencils and easels for drawing. A kiln, and next to it a collection of excellent handmade ashtrays. Many patients remained heavy smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were always occupied, always using their hands or their bodies or their senses, doing exercise or making art, always filling their time with something. “We’d often hear our patients use the expression ‘me and my body’,” Pereira said. “As though there was a dissociation between the ‘me’ and ‘my flesh’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help bring the body back, there was a small gym, exercise classes, physiotherapy and a jacuzzi. And after so much destructive behaviour – messing up their bodies, their relationships, their lives and communities – learning that they could create good and beautiful things was sometimes transformational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know those lines on a running track?” Pereira asked me. He believed that everyone – however imperfect – was capable of finding their own way, given the right support. “Our love is like those lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was firm, he said, but never punished or judged his patients for their relapses or failures. Patients were free to leave at any time, and they were welcome to return if they needed, even if it was more than a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offered no magic wand or one-size-fits-all solution, just this daily search for balance: getting up, having breakfast, making art, taking meds, doing exercise, going to work, going to school, going into the world, going forward. Being alive, he said to me more than once, can be very complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My darling,” he told me, “it’s like I always say: I may be a doctor, but nobody’s perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Insects feel persistent pain after injury, evidence suggests</title>

&lt;p&gt;Brain and ventral nerve cord (resembling the spinal cord in human) of an uninjured fly showing nociceptive sensory neurons (green), stained with anti-GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter (red) and neuronal synaptic marker nc82 (blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Animals need to lose the ‘pain’ brakes to survive in dangerous situations but when humans lose those brakes it makes our lives miserable. We need to get the brakes back to live a comfortable and non-painful existence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, chronic pain is presumed to develop through either peripheral sensitisation or central disinhibition, said Associate Professor Neely. “From our unbiased genomic dissection of neuropathic ‘pain’ in the fly, all our data points to central disinhibition as the critical and underlying cause for chronic neuropathic pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Importantly now we know the critical step causing neuropathic ‘pain’ in flies, mice and probably humans, is the loss of the pain brakes in the central nervous system, we are focused on making new stem cell therapies or drugs that target the underlying cause and stop pain for good.” &lt;/p&gt;

<title>What is Silverblue?</title>
<link>https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Fedora Silverblue is becoming more and more popular inside and outside the Fedora world. So based on feedback from the community, here are answers to some interesting questions about the project. If you do have any other Silverblue related questions, please leave it in the comments section and we will try to answer them in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-28637&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Silverblue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silverblue is a codename for the new generation of the desktop operating system, previously known as Atomic Workstation. The operating system is delivered in images that are created by utilizing the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;rpm-ostree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;. The main benefits of the system are speed, security, atomic updates and immutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does “Silverblue” actually mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Team Silverblue” or “Silverblue” in short doesn’t have any hidden meaning. It was chosen after roughly two months when the project, previously known as Atomic Workstation was rebranded. There were over 150 words or word combinations reviewed in the process. In the end &lt;em&gt;Silverblue&lt;/em&gt; was chosen because it had an available domain as well as the social network accounts. One could think of it as a new take on Fedora’s blue branding, and could be used in phrases like “Go, Team Silverblue!” or “Want to join the team and improve Silverblue?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is ostree?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;OSTree or libostree is a project&lt;/a&gt; that combines a “git-like” model for committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, together with a layer to deploy them and manage the bootloader configuration. OSTree is used by rpm-ostree, a hybrid package/image based system that Silverblue uses. It atomically replicates a base OS and allows the user to “layer” the traditional RPM on top of the base OS if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use Silverblue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it allows you to concentrate on your work and not on the operating system you’re running. It’s more robust as the updates of the system are atomic. The only thing you need to do is to restart into the new image. Also, if there’s anything wrong with the currently booted image, you can easily reboot/rollback to the previous working one, if available. If it isn’t, you can download and boot any other image that was generated in the past, using the &lt;em&gt;ostree&lt;/em&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is the possibility of an easy switch between branches (or, in an old context, Fedora releases). You can easily try the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide&quot;&gt;Rawhide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;updates-testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; branch and then return back to the one that contains the current stable release. Also, you should consider Silverblue if you want to try something new and unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the benefits of an immutable OS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits is security. The base operating system is mounted as read-only, and thus cannot be modified by malicious software. The only way to alter the system is through the &lt;em&gt;rpm-ostree&lt;/em&gt; utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is robustness. It’s nearly impossible for a regular user to get the OS to the state when it doesn’t boot or doesn’t work properly after accidentally or unintentionally removing some system library. Try to think about these kind of experiences from your past, and imagine how Silverblue could help you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does one manage applications and packages in Silverblue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For graphical user interface applications, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flatpak.org/&quot;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; is recommended, if the application is available as a flatpak. Users can choose between Flatpaks from either Fedora and built from Fedora packages and in Fedora-owned infrastructure, or Flathub that currently has a wider offering. Users can install them easily through GNOME Software, which already supports Fedora Silverblue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things users find out is there is no &lt;em&gt;dnf&lt;/em&gt; preinstalled in the OS. The main reason is that it wouldn’t work on Silverblue — and part of its functionality was replaced by the &lt;em&gt;rpm-ostree&lt;/em&gt; command. Users can overlay the traditional packages by using the &lt;em&gt;rpm-ostree install PACKAGE&lt;/em&gt;. But it should only be used when there is no other way. This is because when the new system images are pulled from the repository, the system image must be rebuilt every time it is altered to accommodate the layered packages, or packages that were removed from the base OS or replaced with a different version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora Silverblue comes with the default set of GUI applications that are part of the base OS. The team is working on porting them to Flatpaks so they can be distributed that way. As a benefit, the base OS will become smaller and easier to maintain and test, and users can modify their default installation more easily. If you want to look at how it’s done or help, take a look at the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/flatpak/tutorial/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Toolbox?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/debarshiray/toolbox&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a project to make containers easily consumable for regular users. It does that by using &lt;em&gt;podman&lt;/em&gt;’s rootless containers. &lt;em&gt;Toolbox&lt;/em&gt; lets you easily and quickly create a container with a regular Fedora installation that you can play with or develop on, separated from your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there any Silverblue roadmap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally there isn’t any, as we’re focusing on problems we discover during our testing and from community feedback. We’re currently using Fedora’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://teams.fedoraproject.org/project/silverblue/&quot;&gt;Taiga&lt;/a&gt; to do our planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the release life cycle of the Silverblue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same as regular Fedora Workstation. A new release comes every 6 months and is supported for 13 months. The team plans to release updates for the OS bi-weekly (or longer) instead of daily as they currently do. That way the updates can be more thoroughly tested by QA and community volunteers before they are sent to the rest of the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the future of the immutable OS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our point of view the future of the desktop involves the immutable OS. It’s safest for the user, and Android, ChromeOS, and the last macOS Catalina all use this method under the hood. For the Linux desktop there are still problems with some third party software that expects to write to the OS. HP printer drivers are a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is how parts of the system are distributed and installed. Fonts are a good example. Currently in Fedora they’re distributed in RPM packages. If you want to use them, you have to overlay them and then restart to the newly created image that contains them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the future of standard Workstation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that the Silverblue will replace the regular Workstation. But there’s still a long way to go for Silverblue to provide the same functionality and user experience as the Workstation. In the meantime both desktop offerings will be delivered at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does Atomic Workstation or Fedora CoreOS relate to any of this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic Workstation was the name of the project before it was renamed to Fedora Silverblue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora CoreOS is a different, but similar project. It shares some fundamental technologies with Silverblue, such as &lt;em&gt;rpm-ostree&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;toolbox&lt;/em&gt; and others. Nevertheless, CoreOS is a more minimal, container-focused and automatically updating OS.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One player spent 10 years exploring every corner of Eve Online</title>
<link>https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/2/18286977/eve-online-explorer-10-year-journey-katia-sae</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/2/18286977/eve-online-explorer-10-year-journey-katia-sae</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;Skezuv&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve Online&lt;/em&gt; is unique among spacefaring games — not just for its complexity, but for its structure. The galaxy of New Eden is composed of nearly 8,000 star systems, each one placed into the virtual firmament by the hand of its creators at CCP Games. Some are easy to find, while others are hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FhYcgk&quot;&gt;Few players have actually visited all of New Eden’s known star systems. Fewer still have visited the thousands more that are hidden from view. But only one has visited all of them without losing a single starship. The journey took 10 long years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QTfC3P&quot;&gt;“At heart I consider myself an explorer,” the player told me by telephone. In-game, they’re known as Katia Sae and, given the high-stakes nature of &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; gameplay, they asked me to leave it at that. “I like to be where I’m not supposed to be. In other games I’d be a rogue or a ranger, the ones that like to hide in the shadows and sneak about. In &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;, that translates into being a cloaky explorer, pretty much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KroN12&quot;&gt;Sae tells me that they’ve been playing the game since it first came out, in 2003. Back then, &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t all that beautiful. That changed with the &lt;em&gt;Dominion&lt;/em&gt; expansion in 2009, which transformed the entire look and feel of New Eden practically overnight. Star systems were suddenly bursting with colorful nebulae, and planets had more definition than ever before. Sae said they had been toying with the idea of exploring the universe for a while, and the &lt;em&gt;Dominion&lt;/em&gt; expansion helped push them over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;5MXoKM&quot;&gt;In the six years after the game launched, Sae had heard of other players completing circumnavigations of Known Space. Most of them were speedrunners of a sort, trying to move as quickly as possible from point to point. But Sae had something even more ambitious in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KJdrV1&quot;&gt;“Of course, I gotta be different,” Sae said, with the barest hint of a Southern drawl in their voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Dy3lD9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ONNJlq&quot;&gt;Looking at a map of &lt;em&gt;Eve Online&lt;/em&gt;, someplace like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sov.space/&quot;&gt;Daily Sov Maps&lt;/a&gt;, you would think that the game is just a bunch of points on a map — thousands of dots connected by stargates. But that’s only one part of New Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c8iBqz&quot;&gt;What you’re seeing on those star charts is referred to as Known Space. Sae explains that it’s a collection of 5,201 individual star systems, each one with an average of four to eight planetary bodies inside. The interior, referred to as “highsec space,” is patrolled by AI factions that tend to keep the peace. The exterior, referred to as “nullsec,” is a no-man’s-land controlled by warring factions of players. It’s the region that tends to make headlines with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/12/13920944/death-star-destroyed-during-the-largest-battle-in-eve-online-history&quot;&gt;massive battles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/13/13269612/eve-online-gambling-ban-iwantisk-mittani-world-war-bee&quot;&gt;weird real-world intrigues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IxhflF&quot;&gt;Putting aside any military or political complications in &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;, navigation between all the systems in Known Space is easy enough. Just warp to the nearest stargate, click on it with your mouse, and jump out into a neighboring star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vuPqmA&quot;&gt;But in addition to Known Space, &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; has 2,604 star systems that don’t have fixed locations on any map. They float around in the background of the galaxy, unmoored to any physical location or even to each other. This massive, hidden region is known as Wormhole Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1OV6pk&quot;&gt;As Sae explains it, the only way to reach Wormhole Space is by sending out probes to scan for hidden connections from Known Space. Each system on the map has a few at any given time, and once you’ve discovered one, you can use it like any other stargate. Except you never quite know where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

Executed by Eve player Mynxee, a former member of the player-elected Council of Stellar Management.&quot; data-upload-width=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4ZWSNqdD7Evee05B9YWFx8N3N0=/0x0:480x640/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:480x640):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16000304/KatiaSae_Final72byMynxee.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;A portrait of Katia Sae, by &lt;em&gt;Eve Online&lt;/em&gt; player Mynxee, a former member of the player-elected Council of Stellar Management. &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class=&quot;ql-link&quot; href=&quot;http://cloakywanderer.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mynxee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MgRTJn&quot;&gt;That’s because every connection from Known Space to Wormhole Space is random. Making things more complicated, the connections dissolve every 24 hours. Passing through a connection, players could be in any one of 2,604 systems. The only way back out into Known Space is to discover more hidden connections and jump through once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4bO6Zb&quot;&gt;That could mean traveling through five or six different regions of Wormhole Space in order to break out. Once they do, players commonly find themselves somewhere completely on the other side of New Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KvQJZV&quot;&gt;So, to be different, Sae set out in 2009 with the intention of visiting and photographing every single one of New Eden’s 5,201 Known Space star systems, and every one of the 2,604 star systems in Wormhole Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XKhlXj&quot;&gt;For Sae, it was the beginning of a wonderful period in their gaming life. Every day they would visit new and beautiful places, take amazing photographs, and then find their way home again before moving on to the next. Their gallery contains more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.saganexplorations.net&quot;&gt;50,000 in-game screenshots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;72HDvU&quot;&gt;Some accommodations had to be made, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0tEw5V&quot;&gt;“I did not visit all the planets in all the systems,” Sae explains, “because my time had to be spent scanning for connections. So I had to sacrifice that in order to have time to scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5DkFXE&quot;&gt;“People say, ya know, ‘Get a life,’ and ‘This is a waste of time,’” Sae continues. “They have to understand that I only did this for an hour and a half each day just to unwind after work. I wasn’t killing myself doing this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9Y9eb5&quot;&gt;With few exceptions, the trip was fairly uneventful, Sae says. For about eight years or so, everything was going fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7aaBgK&quot;&gt;Until it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xZPuNg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final push&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b14PO5&quot;&gt;After visiting almost all of Known Space, Sae still had 600 Wormhole Space systems left to discover. Given the random nature of the connections, Sae worried that they might never actually complete their journey. So, they leaned on their in-game clan — called a corporation in &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;’s vernacular — to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8QvyJX&quot;&gt;Sae is part of a group of peaceful explorers called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.signalcartel.com/about&quot;&gt;Signal Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. In a game populated by cutthroats and villains, Signal Cartel is in the business of saving lives. Members perform search and rescue operations for players stuck in Wormhole Space. One of the tasks they perform when not on an emergency call is seeding regions of Wormhole Space with the materials that stranded players need to get out again on their own. Called &lt;a href=&quot;https://evescoutrescue.com/home/esrc.php&quot;&gt;Eve-Scout Rescue Caches&lt;/a&gt;, Sae says they’re little bundles of probes and probe launchers that players can break open in case of emergency and use to get back to Known Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Wluofu&quot;&gt;Signal Cartel’s 500 or so members are constantly bouncing from Known Space into Wormhole Space, checking in on the Rescue Caches and replacing them if necessary. That means they’re seeing far more of that mysterious region than any other factions in the game. So, Sae hatched a plan to use these explorers to help discover the last 600 systems in Wormhole Space that they needed to complete their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lnSryM&quot;&gt;Trouble is, Sae couldn’t tell them what was going on. &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; is a hardcore player-versus-player game. Even if Signal Cartel supported the journey, a spy inside the organization could leak it and set up an ambush for fun and profit. So Sae had to make sure everything happened in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Csj9hU&quot;&gt;The key to their ruse was making use of a mod made exclusively for the members of Signal Cartel. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.signalcartel.com/copilot&quot;&gt;Artificial Life Limited In Scope to On-board Navigation&lt;/a&gt;, or Allison for short. Once it’s loaded up alongside &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;, members use it to help navigate Wormhole Space and to monitor the status of the Rescue Caches they leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;P63tpP&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-V9a28ufoM?rel=0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;clwLHR&quot;&gt;More data than they could ever hope for was being collected by Allison on a daily basis, so Sae and a few close collaborators — Igaze, Tamayo, and Captain Crinkle — secretly co-opted the software to help them along. Then, they sponsored an elaborate in-fiction role-play on the Signal Cartel message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oZN6gO&quot;&gt;Every time a member of Signal Cartel who was participating in the role-play arrived in one of the systems that Sae was looking for, Allison would send out a notification just for them. Then the clock started ticking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XJKgnm&quot;&gt;“We had to race there,” Sae says. “That was the key, right? Because time was of the essence. When a system was found we generally had less than 24 hours to get through the pass, and depending on how deep it was [in Wormhole Space], the more critical it was to get there fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;UJTiom&quot;&gt;With Allison’s help, Sae spent most of a year running down the last 72 systems, some of which were buried five or six connections deep within Wormhole Space. Without Allison’s help, it might have taken Sae far longer. Miraculously, they did it all while regularly coming into contact with other players — many armed to the teeth — and getting away every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FxkRQj&quot;&gt;Once they found out about Sae’s achievement, the developers at CCP invited them into their own private server for a celebration. That’s where they were able to visit the Polaris system, where CCP’s own in-fiction corporation makes its home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U7YeKH&quot;&gt;“They actually teleported me from my own station out there,” Sae says. “There must have been about 30 or so developers and staff, and they had their own fireworks display for me and congratulations and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6twomy&quot;&gt;“And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CCP_Falcon&quot;&gt;CCP Falcon&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;’s community manager], he took me on a tour of the system to let me take pictures like I would have in Known Space, had I actually visited there on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5imepI&quot;&gt;“That was really cool,” Sae says, obvious emotion edging into their voice. “It was really awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;TfxcxJ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The corpse collectors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pxUGy4&quot;&gt;Sae’s entire decadelong journey was conducted with absolute secrecy, save for the last leg, which they shared with just three other players. And Allison, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wsJ98w&quot;&gt;Even then, the effort was entirely hidden from the bulk of Signal Cartel. Members never knew that by using Allison they were helping run down the clock on Sae’s epic journey. In a way, Sae says, they all contributed to the incredible achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xTZ3JA&quot;&gt;But keeping quiet helped Sae stay alive, and they want to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aFau6E&quot;&gt;“In &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; if you get popped, you lose your ship and you’re in a pod,” Sae explains. “And then, if you lose your pod, it actually pops a corpse out. And there’s nuts out there — I call them nuts, because it’s morbid to me — but they collect corpses in game. I think it’s just morbid, but hey, it’s their gameplay, that’s cool, whatever they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;S7z79f&quot;&gt;“I’ve told my corporation that I’m never undocking again,” Sae continues, a wry laugh quickly fading into a more plaintive tone. “I don’t think they believe me, but I’m serious. I’ve really been struggling with giving someone the opportunity of getting her corpse. To me, to keep the achievement pure, I don’t know that I could ever undock her again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;izkEiG&quot;&gt;While their human player will spool up a new in-game character soon, that doesn’t mean Sae’s journey has ended. They still have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;Hm5GvI&quot;&gt;During the hunt for the last 600 systems in Wormhole Space, Sae and Allison began to notice that the missing systems kept cropping up in clusters of two or three at a time. While they’ll never fly a spaceship again, Sae will be subsumed into the deeper role-playing that happens on Signal Cartel’s own private message boards. Using the data gathered from their journey, Sae and Allison will go to work trying to tease out the mysteries of Wormhole Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6VokcH&quot;&gt;Hopefully that project doesn’t take nearly as long as the first&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow 0.0.0.0/8 as a valid address range&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longstanding prohibition against using 0.0.0.0/8 dates back to two issues with the early internet. There was an interoperability problem with BSD 4.2 in 1984, fixed in BSD 4.3 in 1986. BSD 4.2 has long since been retired. Secondly, addresses of the form 0.x.y.z were initially defined only as a source address in an ICMP datagram, indicating &quot;node number x.y.z on this IPv4 network&quot;, by nodes that know their address on their local network, but do not yet know their network prefix, in RFC0792 (page 19). This usage of 0.x.y.z was later repealed in RFC1122 (section 3.2.2.7), because the original ICMP-based mechanism for learning the network prefix was unworkable on many networks such as Ethernet (which have longer addresses that would not fit into the 24 &quot;node number&quot; bits). Modern networks use reverse ARP (RFC0903) or BOOTP (RFC0951) or DHCP (RFC2131) to find their full 32-bit address and CIDR netmask (and other parameters such as default gateways). 0.x.y.z has had 16,777,215 addresses in 0.0.0.0/8 space left unused and reserved for future use, since 1989. This patch allows for these 16m new IPv4 addresses to appear within a box or on the wire. Layer 2 switches don't care. 0.0.0.0/32 is still prohibited, of course.

<title>Why the C++ standard ships every three years</title>
<link>https://herbsutter.com/2019/07/13/draft-faq-why-does-the-c-standard-ship-every-three-years/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://herbsutter.com/2019/07/13/draft-faq-why-does-the-c-standard-ship-every-three-years/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WG21 has a strict schedule (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://wg21.link/p1000&quot;&gt;P1000&lt;/a&gt;) by which we ship the standard every three years. We don’t delay it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time of each cycle, we regularly get questions about “but why so strict?”, especially because we have many new committee members who aren’t as familiar with our history and the reasons why we do things this way now. And so, on the pre-Cologne admin telecon last Friday, several of the chairs encouraged me to write down the reasons why we do it this way, and some of the history behind the decision to adopt this schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now done that by adding a FAQ section to the next draft of P1000, and I’ve sent a copy of it to the committee members now en route to Cologne. That FAQ material will appear in the next public revision of P1000 which will be in the post-meeting mailing a few weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, because the draft FAQ might be of general public interest too, here is a copy of that material. I hope you find it largely useful, occasionally illuminating, and maybe even a bit entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now off to the airport… see (many of) you in Cologne. We are expecting about 220 people… by far our largest meeting ever. More about that in the post-meeting trip report after the meeting is over…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(As of pre-Cologne, July 2019) There are bugs in the standard, so should we delay C++20?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on our planned course and speed: Fixing bugs is the purpose of this final year, and it’s why this schedule set the feature freeze deadline for C++“20” in early “19” (Kona), to leave a year to fix bugs including to get a round of international comments this summer. We have until early 2020 (three meetings: Cologne, Belfast, and Prague) to apply that review feedback and any other issue resolutions and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If we had just another meeting or two, we could add &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt; which is almost ready, so should we delay C++20?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just wait a couple more meetings (post-Prague) and C++23 will be open for business and &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt; can be the first thing voted into the C++23 working draft. For example, that’s what we did with concepts; it was not quite ready to be rushed from its TS straight into C++17, so the core feature was voted into draft C++20 at the first meeting of C++20 (Toronto), leaving plenty of time to refine and adopt the remaining controversial part of the TS that needed a little more bake time (the non-“template” syntax) which was adopted the following year (San Diego). Now we have the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This feels overly strict. Why do we ship releases of the IS at fixed time intervals (3 years)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s one of only two basic project management options to release the C++ IS, and experience has demonstrated that it’s better than the other option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the two project management options to release the C++ IS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two basic release target choices: Pick the features, or pick the release time, and whichever you pick means relinquishing control over determining the other. It is not possible to control both at once. They can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;3751&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://herbsutter.com/image-5/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;806,343&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=806&quot; src=&quot;https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=1100&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3751&quot; srcset=&quot;https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png 806w, https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=150 150w, https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=300 300w, https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.png?w=768 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) “What”: Pick the features, and ship when they’re ready; you don’t get to pick the release time.&lt;/strong&gt; If you discover that a feature in the draft standard needs more bake time, you delay the world until it’s ready. You work on big long-pole features that require multiple years of development by making a release big enough to cover the necessary development time, then try to stop working on new features entirely while stabilizing the release (a big join point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the model for C++98 (originally expected to ship around 1994; Bjarne originally said if it didn’t ship by about then it would be a failure) and C++11 (called 0x because x was expected to be around 7). This model “left the patient open” for indeterminate periods and led to delayed integration testing and release. It led to great uncertainty in the marketplace wondering when the committee would ship the next standard, or even if it would ever ship (yes, among the community, the implementers, and even within the committee, some had serious doubts in both 1996 and 2009 whether we would ever ship the respective release). During this time, most compilers were routinely several years behind implementing the standard, because who knew how many more incompatible changes the committee would make while tinkering with the release, or when it would even ship? This led to wide variation and fragmentation in the C++ support of compilers available to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we do that, were we stupid? Not exactly, just inexperienced and… let’s say “optimistic,” for (1) is the road paved with the best of intentions. In 1994/5/6, and again in 2007/8/9, we really believed that if we just slipped another meeting or three we’d be done, and each time we ended up slipping up to four years. We learned the hard way that there’s really no such thing as slipping by one year, or even two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this has changed, with option (2)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) “When”: Pick the release time, and ship what features are ready; you don’t get to pick the feature set.&lt;/strong&gt; If you discover that a feature in the draft standard needs more bake time, you yank it and ship what’s ready. You can still work on big long-pole features that require multiple releases’ worth of development time, by simply doing that work off to the side in “branches,” and merging them to the trunk/master IS when they’re ready, and you are constantly working on features because every feature’s development is nicely decoupled from an actual ship vehicle until it’s ready (no big join point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the model since 2012, and we don’t want to go back. It “closes the patient” regularly and leads to sustaining higher quality by forcing regular integration and not merging work into the IS draft until it has reached a decent level of stability, usually in a feature branch. It also creates a predictable ship cycle for the industry to rely on and plan for. During this time, compilers have been shipping conforming implementations sooner and sooner after each standard (which had never happened before), and in 2020 we expect multiple fully conforming implementations the same year the standard is published (which has never happened before). This is nothing but goodness for the whole market – implementers, users, educators, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, note that since we went to (2), we’ve also been shipping more work (as measured by big/medium/small feature counts) at higher quality (as measured by a sharp reduction in defect reports and comments on review drafts of each standard), while shipping whatever is ready (and if anything isn’t, deferring just that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How serious are we about (2)? What if a major feature by a prominent committee member was “almost ready”… we’d be tempted to wait then, wouldn’t we?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very serious, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have historical data: In Jacksonville 2016, at the feature cutoff for C++17, Bjarne Stroustrup made a plea in plenary for including concepts in C++17. When it failed to get consensus, Stroustrup was directly asked if he would like to delay C++17 for a year to get concepts in. Stroustrup said No without any hesitation or hedging, and added that C++17 without concepts was more important than a C++18 or possibly C++19 with concepts, even though Stroustrup had worked on concepts for about 15 years. The real choice then was between: (2) shipping C++17 without concepts and then C++20 with concepts (which we did), or (1) renaming C++17 to C++20 which is isomorphic to (2) except for skipping C++17 and not shipping what was already ready for C++17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about something between (1) and (2), say do basically (2) but with “a little” schedule flexibility to take “a little” extra time when we feel we need to stabilize a feature?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, because that would be (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘mythical small slip’ was explained by Fred Brooks in &lt;em&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/em&gt;, with the conclusion: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/Docs/C++/DesignPatterns/smallSlips.html&quot;&gt;”Take no small slips.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment, imagine we did slip C++20. The reality is that we would be switching from (2) back to (1), no matter how much we might try to deny it, and without any actual benefit. If we decided to delay C++20 for more fit-and-finish, we will delay the standard by at least two years. There is no such thing as a one-meeting or three-meeting slip, because during this time other people will continue to (rightly) say “well my feature only needs one more meeting too, since we’re slipping a meeting let’s add that too.” And once we slip at least two years, we’re saying that C++20 becomes C++22 or more likely C++23… but we’re already going to ship C++23! — So we’d still be shipping C++23 on either plan, and the only difference is that we’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; shipping C++20 in the meantime with the large amount of fully-baked work that’s ready to go, and making the world wait three more years for it. Gratuitously, because the delay will not benefit those baked features, which is most or all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the suggestion amounts to “let’s make C++20 be C++22 or C++23,” and the simple answer is “yes, we’re going to have C++23 too, but in addition to C++20 and not instead of it.” To delay C++20 actually means to skip C++20, instead of releasing the great good work that is stable and ready, and there’s no benefit to doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But feature X is broken / needs more bake time than we have bugfix time left in C++20!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No problem! We can just pull it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, someone needs to write the paper aimed at EWG or LEWG (as appropriate) that shows the problem and/or the future doors we’re closing, and proposes removing it from the IS working draft. Those groups will consider it, and if they decide the feature is broken (and plenary agrees), that’s fine, the feature will be delayed to C++next. We have actually done this before, with C++0x concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But under plan (1), we would be delaying, not only that feature, but &lt;em&gt;the entire feature set&lt;/em&gt; of C++20 to C++23! That would be… excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does (2) mean “major/minor” releases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. We said that at first, before we understood that (2) really simply means you don’t get to pick the feature set, not even at a “major/minor” granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model (2) simply means “ship what’s ready.” That leads to releases that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;similarly sized (aka regular medium-sized) for “smaller” features because those tend to take shorter lead times (say, &amp;lt; 3 years each) and so generally we see similar numbers completed per release; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable sized (aka lumpy) for “bigger” features that take longer lead times (say, &amp;gt; 3 years each) and each IS release gets whichever of those mature to the point of becoming ready to merge during that IS’s time window, so sometimes there will be more than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So C++14 and C++17 were relatively small, because a lot of the standardization work during that time was taking place in long-pole features that lived in proposal papers (e.g., contracts) and TS “feature branches” (e.g., concepts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C++20 is a big release …&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. C++20 has a lot of major features. Three of the biggest all start with the letters “co” (concepts, contracts, coroutines) so perhaps we could call it co_cpp20. Or co_dependent. Wait, we’re digressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;… and so aren’t we cramming a lot into a three-year cycle for C++20?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, see “lumpy” above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++20 is big, not because we did more work in those three years, but because many long-pole items (including at least two that have been worked on in their current form since 2012, off to the side as P-proposals and TS “branches”) happened to mature and get consensus to merge into the IS draft in the same release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has pretty much always been true that major features take many years. The main difference between plan (1) for C++98 and C++11 and plan (2) now is: In C++98 and C++11 we held the standard until they were all ready, now we still ship those big ones when they’re ready but we also ship other things that are ready in the meantime instead of going totally dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++20 is the same 3-year cycle as C++14 and C++17; it’s not that we did more in these 3 years than in the previous two 3-year cycles, it’s just that more long-pole major features became ready to merge. And if any really are unready, fine, we can just pull them again and let them bake more for C++23. If there is, we need that to be explained in a paper that proposes pulling it, and why, for it to be actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think the right way to think about it is that C++14+17+20 taken as a whole is our third 9-year cycle (2011-2020), after C++98 (1989-1998) and C++11 (2002-2011), but because we were on plan (2) we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; shipped the parts that were ready at the 3- and 6-year points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t it better to catch bugs while the product is in development, vs. after it has been released to customers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we’re talking about that as a reason to delay the C++ standard, the question implies two false premises: (a) it assumes the features haven’t been released and used before the standard ships (many already have production usage experience); and (b) it assumes all the features can be used together before the standard ships (they can’t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaborating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re (a): Most major C++20 features have been implemented in essentially their current draft standard form in at least one shipping compiler, and in most cases actually used in production code (i.e., has already been released to customers who are very happy with it). For example, coroutines (adopted only five months ago as of this writing) has been used in production in MSVC for two years and in Clang for at least a year with very happy customers at scale (e.g., Azure, Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re (b): The reality is that we aren’t going to find many feature interaction problems until users are using them in production, which generally means until after the standard ships, because implementers will generally wait until the standard ships to implement most things. That’s why when we show any uncertainty about when we ship, what generally happens is that implementations wait – oh, they’ll implement a few things, but they will hit Pause on implementing the whole thing until they know we’re ready to set it in stone. Ask &amp;lt;favorite compiler&amp;gt; team what happened when they implemented &amp;lt;major feature before it was in a published standard&amp;gt;. In a number of cases, they had to implement it more than once, and break customers more than once. So it’s reasonable for implementers to wait for the committee to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget the feature interaction problem. In addition to shipping when we are ready, we need time after we ship to find and fix problems with interactions among features and add support for such interactions that we on typically cannot know before widespread use of new features. No matter how long we delay the standard, there will be interactions we can’t discover until much later. The key is to manage that risk with design flexibility to adjust the features in a compatible way, not to wait until all risk is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The standard is never perfect… don’t we ship mistakes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we see a feature that’s not ready, yes we should pull it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we see a feature that could be better, but we know that the change can be done in a backward-compatible way, that’s not a reason to not ship it now; it can be done as an extension in C++next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do intentionally ship features we plan to further improve, as long as we have good confidence we can do so in a backward-compatible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But shouldn’t we aim to minimize shipping mistakes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. We do aim for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we don’t aim to eliminate all risk. There is also a risk and (opportunity) cost to not shipping something we think is ready. So far, we’ve been right most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are we sure that our quality now is better than when were on plan (1)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By objective metrics, notably national body comment volume and defect reports, C++14 and C++17 have been our most stable releases ever, each about 3-4 times better on those metrics than C++98 or C++11. And the reason is because we ship regularly, and put big items into TS branches first (including full wording on how they integrate with the trunk standard) and merge them later when we know they’re more baked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since 2012 the core standard has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been maintained in a near-ship-ready state (so that even our working drafts are at least as high quality as the shipped C++98 and C++11 standards). That never happened before 2012, where we would often keep the patient open with long issues lists and organs lying around nearby that we meant to put back soon; now we know we can meet the schedule at high quality because we always stay close to a ship-ready state. If we wanted to, we could ship the CD right now without the Cologne meeting and still be way higher quality than C++98’s or C++11’s CDs (or, frankly, their published standards) ever were. Given that C++98 and C++11 were successful, recognizing that we’re now at strictly higher quality than that all the time means we’re in a pretty good place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C++98 and C++11 each took about 9 years and were pretty good products …&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 1989-1998, and 2002-2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;… and C++14 and C++17 were minor releases, and C++20 is major?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I think the right comparable is C++14+17+20 taken as a whole: That is our third 9-year cycle, but because we were on plan (2) we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; shipped the parts that were ready at the 3- and 6-year points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does (2) allow making feature-based targets like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wg21.link/p0592&quot;&gt;P0592&lt;/a&gt; for C++next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! As long as it doesn’t contain words like “must include these features,” because that would be (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming for a specific set of features, and giving those ones priority over others, is fine – then it’s a prioritization question. We’ll still take only what’s ready, but we can definitely be more intentional about prioritizing what to work on first so it has the best chance of being ready as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@robertwiblin&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Robert Wiblin&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/0*DB7wa-c4eu_UBcWb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;n dv gy gz&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;gw&quot;&gt;Careful before you click that share button!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;I’ve noticed something about &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt; that is really weird. Crazy enough that I’ve told dozens of &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; users and none have believed me. They swear I have to be wrong, until I show them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Whenever you share a photo with a specific person or account on &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;, it creates a link that will allow anyone in the world to view those photos, forever, until you go and manually deactivate that link in an obscure part of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;You can see it here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;gw&quot;&gt;(Had I instead shared it with the Photos account visible 4 seconds in, the result would have been identical.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;What have you just watched? If I go and share a photo with a specific other Google Account, I can use that link to view it in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;i) another Google Account it wasn’t shared with (25 seconds in), and;&lt;br/&gt;ii) an incognito window where I’m not logged into any Google Account at all (39 seconds in)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;If that ‘secret’’ link is ever revealed, anyone anywhere will be able to see it until I go and delete that specific sharing instance. And I’d have no way to find out that they were viewing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;People constantly tell me I can’t be right about this — it’ll happen in the comments below, I promise — because the &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;interface never indicates that this is going on.&lt;/em&gt; Nowhere did “Create shared URL” or anything similar appear in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the interface looks almost identical to &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;, which by default only lets people see a file when logged into the specific account it was shared with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt; also lists who a file is shared with when you click the share icon — so people using &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; naturally assume their photos are private when they see that nobody is listed when you click the share icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;I can only ever find out that I’ve created this permanent semi-public link by going to the ‘Sharing’ tab in &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt;, which is very easy to miss. Nothing in the interface relating to that particular photo will show me. And even the Sharing page gives zero indication that you’ve made a &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;publicly visible link&lt;/em&gt; rather than just shared a photo with an individual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;‘Albums’ work the same way. If you create an album and share it with a specific Google Account, it will create a permanent ‘secret’ URL with all those photos visible to anyone with the link, until you go and delete or un-share the Album from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is js iu jt iw ju iy jv ja jw jc&quot;&gt;Firstly it’s unacceptable because most users don’t realise it’s happening. The interface is so poorly designed that the most common reaction I’ve had when I tell &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; users about this is literal disbelief. The only way to convince people is to show them with their own eyes. If our private and potentially sensitive data is going to be revealed this way, it should be clear that it’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;It’s also unacceptable because it creates an excessive risk of sensitive data being exposed. People often take photos of things like private documents, or themselves naked. It’s very important only the right people get to see these things! Google is a data company that has a responsibility to its users to make sure that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;How could the ‘secret’ link end up in the wrong hands? Some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jx jy jz&quot;&gt;An email thread / document with a link to the photo or album is forwarded or shared with the wrong person, or accidentally posted somewhere public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is ka iu kb iw kc iy kd ja ke jc jx jy jz&quot;&gt;The recipient naturally thinks the link is only works for them (as would be the case for &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;) and doesn’t take care to prevent it becoming public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is ka iu kb iw kc iy kd ja ke jc jx jy jz&quot;&gt;Links sent by emails are semi-public because they move across the internet unencrypted, and are simple to intercept, especially for governments. It’s only OK to link to sensitive things by email if the recipient needs to be logged in to view them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is ka iu kb iw kc iy kd ja ke jc jx jy jz&quot;&gt;A database of these links is one day leaked or hacked, or people figure out a pattern in how the ‘secret’ URLs are generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is ka iu kb iw kc iy kd ja ke jc jx jy jz&quot;&gt;Someone’s emails or other documents are hacked or leaked, with the links to photos contained inside for all to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Keep in mind the status quo is for these links to persist &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;, providing plenty of time for one of the above things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Furthermore, if you were discussing a topic by email it wouldn’t be that unusual for exactly the wrong person (e.g. someone at another company, or a member of your extended family) to be later added to a thread and gain access to any photos someone has linked to along the way. Most people have terrible information security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Maybe you don’t care. Fair enough. But if you’re a teenager using Photos to share racy photos with your partner, or an immigration lawyer using Photos to receive and send photographs of client documents, you might well care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;And for political dissidents around the world, clarity about what they are sharing and with who is a literal matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Would Google use this sharing method for their sensitive internal photos or documents? Not a chance! It would be negligent and likely illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is js iu jt iw ju iy jv ja jw jc&quot;&gt;Easy: sharing behaviour in &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; should be changed to match that of &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;, which is excellent and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;On &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, if the person you want to share with has a Google Account, it’s shared with that account exclusively. And if they don’t, you have the opportunity to either send them a link they can convert into permanent access for one Google Account of their choice, or knowingly make the file public and send them a link to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;If that’s not possible, &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos’&lt;/em&gt; interface should be changed to make it clear that ‘Anyone with the link can view’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;Until this week you could automatically get photos from an Android phone uploaded to &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt; and share them using its far superior interface. But that option was just turned off completely, preventing this workaround. You can read about that in my previous post: &lt;a class=&quot;aq cc kf kg kh ki&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/googles-new-system-for-drive-photos-image-syncing-is-insane-4b63fe03aae7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;ir kj&quot;&gt;Google’s new system for Drive/Photos image syncing is insane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;ir kj&quot;&gt;Added:&lt;/strong&gt; This post has really blown up with over 300,000 views in under a day. Lest I seem like I’m all negativity, I should point out that the &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; team has made good decisions too — for instance, its interface for scanning and selecting photos is impressively designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ip iq eq bh ir b is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc&quot;&gt;There are a number of comments from people who say they’ve always known &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt; worked this way. That’s great, though given I’ve only seen a few dozen responses like that out of 300,000 readers, they seem to be in the minority. I suspect that what drives people’s expectations is what other services they’ve used before trying &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt;. If, like me, you are used to &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, and then switch to &lt;em class=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/em&gt;, this behaviour is totally unexpected and alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Google Photo is making your photos semi-public and you probably don’t realise</og:title>
<og:description>I’ve noticed something about Google Photos that is weird enough that nobody initially believes it.</og:description>
