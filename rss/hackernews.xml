<title>Renault&amp;#039;s driver UX is a disaster waiting to happen</title>
<link>https://grumpy.website/post/0S6F8ozn5</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://grumpy.website/post/0S6F8ozn5</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post_author&quot;&gt;dmitriid:&lt;/span&gt; My favorite theory (which is yet to be challenged) is that modern car interfaces are designed by people who have never even seen a car in their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest entry in my parade of &quot;who in their right mind would come up with this&quot; is Renault Talisman 2019 (could be 2018 but it doesn't matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on about many things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The steering wheel contains two dozen buttons, and you regularly use maybe three of them. They had to add another stick underneath (you can't even see it) to control audio volume. But you can't change tracks or switch radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The touch screen is filled with insanely small targets (I've highlighted some of them in the upper-right photo) with no margin for error or tolerances. You missed it? Good luck finding your way out of a new screen because all the controls constantly shift around the screen (change track is in the middle? now it's at the bottom, now it's gone etc.), they change their appearance and behaviour (now it's an icon, now it's a button, now it's a draggable area), all the animations are inconsistent (slide up is fast, slide down is ridiculously slow), etc. etc. etc. There's literally no end to this insanity. The screen will always find a way to confuse you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it all pales in comparison to the switch that toggles assistive driving (aka cruise control). Once on, cruise control is controlled by three dedicated buttons and a thumb stick on the left side of the steering wheel. Logic would dictate that you turn it on by a dedicated button located there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the central console or somewhere in the abomination of a touchscreen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you sweet summer child. Also no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. I cannot possibly be under your right elbow behind the parking break switch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more times than I can count on my right elbow when I deactivated it by accident. On a highway. Doing 120 kmh. Prime time to crane your head awkwardly down and slightly back while awkwardly bending your right hand to try and re-activate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision alone would put me off Renault for good. Coupled with an abhorrent touch screen and a functionally void steering wheel, I'd say that this model is a disaster waiting to happen. It actively makes the driver take their eyes from the road for every single little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a shame because the elements of the design that don't have any actual UX are extremely well executed (both the aforementioned cruise control, lane assist and some minor things).&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Coming back from a long day to find over a hundred notifications from people being supportive is amazing, I really appreciate this community. I've worked hard on this channel to make learning infosec possible for anyone regardless of ability to pay, thanks for supporting me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp outages</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-down-site-app-not-working-pictures-photos-images-whatsapp-a8986426.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-down-site-app-not-working-pictures-photos-images-whatsapp-a8986426.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than a total or global outage, the Facebook issue appears to be specific to certain features. Users report that specific posts or photos don't show, but that the page might load, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indy100.com/article/facebook-down-instagram-whatsapp-not-working-loading-photos-8986491&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;body-link&quot; data-vars-item-name=&quot;BL-8986426-https://www.indy100.com/article/facebook-down-instagram-whatsapp-not-working-loading-photos-8986491&quot; data-vars-event-id=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;leading to international frustration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues are being reported across the world, according to the tracking website Down Detector. Users in Europe, the US, South America and Japan were particularly affected, with thousands of users across the globe running into problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems come at the same time as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-down-not-working-picture-voice-messages-photo-video-download-failed-a8986406.html&quot; class=&quot;body-link&quot; data-vars-item-name=&quot;BL-8986426-http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-down-not-working-picture-voice-messages-photo-video-download-failed-a8986406.html&quot; data-vars-event-id=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;a similar issue on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. There, files appear to be running into problems sending – meaning that photos, videos and voice messages won't show up properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;166&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;1/15&lt;/span&gt; Facebook is born&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called 'TheFacebook' from his dorm. Within 24 hours the college social network had more than 1,000 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;2/15&lt;/span&gt; Winklevoss twins sue Zuckerberg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one week of launching, fellow Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of stealing their idea. It would be four years later when the resulting lawsuit was finally settled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;3/15&lt;/span&gt; Open for business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social network finally opened it platform to everyone on 26 September, 2006. The move proved the catalyst in supercharging the site's already explosive growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;4/15&lt;/span&gt; Billion-dollar bid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo offered $1 billion to buy Facebook in September 2006 but Zuckerberg turned it down. 'I don’t know what I could do with the money,' Zuckerberg reportedly said. 'I’d just start another social networking site'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;5/15&lt;/span&gt; In the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, almost five years since the site launched, Facebook turned a profit for the first time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;6/15&lt;/span&gt; Taking the lead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook overtook MySpace in 2010 to become the world’s most popular social network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;7/15&lt;/span&gt; Taking on the tech giants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Google launched its own social network that it hoped would knock Facebook from its perch. Despite its initial success, Google+ ultimately failed and will be shut down completely in 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;8/15&lt;/span&gt; Facebook goes public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 18 May, 2012, Facebook went public. The initial public offering raised $16 billion – the third largest in US history&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;9/15&lt;/span&gt; Gobbling up the competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook acquired Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, consolidating its position as the world's leading social network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;10/15&lt;/span&gt; One billion users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 4 October, 2012, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had hit 1 billion users. 'If you’re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honour of serving you,' he wrote in a blog post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;11/15&lt;/span&gt; Expanding its empire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2014 Facebook acquired the messaging app WhatsApp for $19.3 billion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REUTERS/Dado Ruvic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;12/15&lt;/span&gt; Two billion users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2017, Facebook passed the 2 billion user milestone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REUTERS/Dado Ruvic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;13/15&lt;/span&gt; Privacy scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 17 March 2018, news broke that UK firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from around 87 million Facebook users for the purpose of political profiling in the build up to the 2016 US presidential elections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;14/15&lt;/span&gt; Record profits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the scandals and subsequent #DeleteFacebook campaign, Facebook posted record profits just before its 15th anniversary, the equivalent of $7.37 from each of its 2.32 billions users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iStock/Independent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;count&quot;&gt;15/15&lt;/span&gt; Unhappy users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study found that people are happier when they don’t use Facebook, adding to mounting evidence surrounding the impact social media has on mental health&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex Features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook's &quot;Platform Status&quot; page, which is intended to track problems with the site, shows a message indicating that the service &quot;is Healthy&quot;. But that site can be slow to reflect problems, especially when they are less widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a result of a server configuration change, many people had trouble accessing our apps and services,&quot; Facebook posted on Twitter after that previous outage was fixed. &quot;We've now resolved the issues and our systems are recovering. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate everyone’s patience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those problems happened in March, they were said to be perhaps the biggest outage in the history of the internet, hitting millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By duration, this is by far the largest outage we have seen since the launch of Downdetector in 2012,” Tom Sanders, co-founder of Downdetector, told Techcrunch in the wake of that outage. “Our systems processed about 7.5 million problem reports from end users over the course of this incident. Never before have we such a large scale outage.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>U.S. Life Expectancy Drops for Third Year in a Row (2018)</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-life-expectancy-drops-third-year-row-reflecting-rising-drug-overdose-suicide-rates-180970942/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-life-expectancy-drops-third-year-row-reflecting-rising-drug-overdose-suicide-rates-180970942/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;137.68564920273&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;On average, life expectancy across the globe is steadily&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/united-states-drops-21-places-global-life-expectancy-rankings-180970585/&quot;&gt;ticking upward&lt;/a&gt;—but the same can’t be said for the United States. Three &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; newly published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight a worrying downward trend in Americans’ average life expectancy, with the country’s ongoing drug crisis and climbing suicide rates contributing to a third straight year of decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;As Lenny Bernstein notes for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-life-expectancy-declines-again-a-dismal-trend-not-seen-since-world-war-i/2018/11/28/ae58bc8c-f28c-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?utm_term=.c514d489e028&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the three-year drop represents the longest sustained decline in expected lifespan since the tumultuous period of 1915 to 1918. Then, the decrease could be at least partially attributed to World War I and the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. Now, the drivers are drug overdoses, which claimed 70,237 lives in 2017, and suicides, which numbered more than 47,000 over the same period. Both of these figures rose between 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;“Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation’s overall health,” CDC Director Robert R. Redfield said in a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/s1129-US-life-expectancy.html&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, “and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;According to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/americans-life-expectancy-dips-as-middle-aged-see-uptick-in-death-rates/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’s Beth Mole, 2015 marked the first recorded drop in U.S. life expectancy since 1993, with Americans shaving an average of 0.1 years off of their lifespans. The same proved true in 2016 and 2017, Cathleen O’Grady writes in a separate &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/another-year-another-decrease-in-life-expectancy-in-the-us/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; piece, making the latest projection 78.6 years, down 0.3 years from 2015’s 78.8. Broken down by gender, men could expect to live an average of 76.1 years, down from 76.2 in 2016, while women could anticipate living until 81.1, the same age projected in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;Although the country’s aging Baby Boomer population factored into the decline, Mike Stobbe of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/de57909c5bcc4162b122948539ed9c6a&quot;&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that increased deaths amongst younger and middle-aged individuals (particularly those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/51325-cdc-report-life-expectancy-drops&quot;&gt;between&lt;/a&gt; 24 and 44) had an outsized effect on calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;As Kathryn McHugh of Harvard Medical School tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/11/29/671844884/u-s-life-expectancy-drops-amid-disturbing-rise-in-overdoses-and-suicides&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;’s Richard Harris, “We're seeing the drop in life expectancy not because we're hitting a cap [for lifespans of] people in their 80s, [but] because people are dying in their 20s [and] 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;The overall number of deaths across the U.S. totaled 2.8 million, or 69,255 more than in 2016, Erin Durkin notes for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/29/americans-life-expectancy-down-drug-overdoses-suicides-rise-report&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db328.htm&quot;&gt;top 10&lt;/a&gt; leading causes of death—heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries (drug overdoses constituted slightly less than half of this category in 2017), chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and suicide—only cancer witnessed a decrease in mortality rates. Seven, including suicide and unintentional injuries, experienced increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;Josh Katz and Margot Sanger-Katz of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/29/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; note that the rising number of overdose deaths corresponds with the growing use of synthetic opioids known as fentanyls. Deaths involving fentanyl increased more than 45 percent in 2017 alone, while deaths from legal painkillers remained stable from 2016 to 2017. To date, the overdose epidemic has wrought the most devastation in Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;Robert Anderson, chief of the Center for Health Statistics’ mortality branch, tells the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;’s Bernstein that the leveling off of prescription drug deaths may be the result of public health initiatives designed to curb the widespread availability and subsequent abuse of such medicines. Still, the rising prevalence of fentanyl, which is often mixed with heroin or falsely marketed as heroin, means the nation’s drug crisis is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;In terms of deaths from suicide, Bernstein writes that there is a huge disparity between urban and rural Americans. The suicide rate amongst urban residents is 11.1 per 100,000 people, as opposed to rural residents’ 20 per 100,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;“Higher suicide rates in rural areas are due to nearly 60 percent of rural homes having a gun versus less than half of homes in urban areas,” psychiatrist and behavioral scientist Keith Humphreys of Stanford University says. “Having easily available lethal means is a big risk factor for suicide.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;Speaking with NPR, disease prevention expert William Dietz of George Washington University stressed the links between overdoses and suicides. Both may occur amongst people “less connected to each other in communities” and are tied to a “sense of hopelessness, which in turn could lead to an increase in rates of suicide and certainly addictive behaviors.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d9bfac7c-7fff-2af6-e8de-710bff55a2be&quot;&gt;McHugh echoes Dietz, concluding, “There's a tremendous amount of overlap between the two that isn't talked about nearly enough.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why did moving the mouse cursor cause Windows 95 to run more quickly?</title>
<link>https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/11533/why-did-moving-the-mouse-cursor-cause-windows-95-to-run-more-quickly</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/11533/why-did-moving-the-mouse-cursor-cause-windows-95-to-run-more-quickly</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just Windows 95, but Windows 3.x as well, even though they work very differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other answers talk about pre-emptive multitasking, so let's first clarify this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window 3.x was using cooperative multitasking where each app would release the cpu for the other apps to use it. Windows 95 uses pre-emptive multitasking where each app is allocated a time slice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is linked to how the graphic interface works: in a windows graphical app, there is a loop called the 'message pump':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every event (mouse moved, window got resized, etc) is pushed into a queue. The app is responsible to check if it has messages waiting and, if yes, pull them and process them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is at this moment that Windows 3.x was switching to other apps since there was a single point where all apps where going to, but this doesn't apply to windows 95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really happens is that, on both OS, you need to process the message loop, but if you want to update something in the background, like a task, a display update, etc, you'd set a timer and the timer would put a message in the queue at a regular interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were better ways to do things on Windows 95, but developers took time to transition from Windows 3.x and many apps were structured the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the main mechanism was to rely only on the message loop and background operations were done through timer messages, moving the mouse would trigger a lot of messages, move the app up in priority, wake the app up, and get the app to process the background tasks messages. Without moving the mouse, the timer messages would be read up only at a rather slow interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous app for this was the disk defragmenter where operations would wait for a message to update the graphic interface! so shaking the mouse would speed up the defrag.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Whoops, yeah we're saying 3 different things here...
• Front-facing ARKit requires TrueDepth, which is only on X/XS/XR
• ARKit 3 features + FaceTime Attention Correction require XS/XR (though I suspect this is an A12 Bionic constraint, rather than slightly newer TrueDepth)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Spotify shuts down direct music uploading for independent artists</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.altpress.com/news/spotify-independent-artists-upload-music-streaming/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;td-post-featured-image&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/07/spotify-002.jpg&quot; data-caption=&quot;[Photo by: Unsplash/Sara Kurfess]&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; class=&quot;entry-thumb td-modal-image&quot; src=&quot;https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/07/spotify-002-696x388.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/07/spotify-002-696x388.jpg 696w, https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/07/spotify-002-300x167.jpg 300w, https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/07/spotify-002.jpg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; alt=&quot;spotify&quot; title=&quot;spotify&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[Photo by: Unsplash/Sara Kurfess]&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://altpress.com/tag/spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;has changed the way artists can upload music, now prohibiting individual musicians from putting their songs on the streaming service directly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new move requires a third party to be involved in the business of uploads. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altpress.com/news/warped-tour-anthony-green-crowdsurf-ocean-circa-survive/&quot;&gt;Anthony Green pulls off epic crowdsurf to the ocean at Warped Tour stop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company announced the change on Monday, saying it will close the beta program and stop accepting direct uploads by the end of July. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most impactful way we can improve the experience of delivering music to Spotify for as many artists and labels as possible is to lean into the great work our distribution partners are already doing to serve the artist community,” Spotify said in a statement on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://artists.spotify.com/blog/now-in-beta-upload-your-music-in-spotify-for-artists&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;its blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Over the past year, we’ve vastly improved our work with distribution partners to ensure metadata quality, protect artists from infringement, provide their users with instant access to Spotify for Artists, and more.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way for us to serve artists and labels is to focus our resources on developing tools in areas where Spotify can uniquely benefit them — like Spotify for Artists (which more than 300,000 creators use to gain new insight into their audience) and our playlist submission tool (which more than 36,000 artists have used to get playlisted for the very first time since it launched a year ago). We have a lot more planned here in the coming months,” the post continued. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The direct upload function began last September, allowing independent artists to utilize the streaming site without distribution methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smaller artists will now need to return to sites like Bandcamp, SoundCloud and others to upload their material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people, especially artists, were upset about the decision. You can see what they had to say on Twitter below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.4517766497462&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;spotify discontinuing their direct upload beta while removing any song uploaded through it shows again how spotify does not give a single fuck about artists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sarah (@_herrmannsarah) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_herrmannsarah/status/1145791915364880384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;10.590062111801&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;for me the biggest takeaway from Spotify closing its direct upload beta is that the company isn’t actually as globally influential as it thought, with respect to convincing artists that uploading *only* to Spotify was anywhere near enough to sustain their careers + satisfy fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Spotify news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pre-saving an upcoming release from your favorite artists on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altpress.com/tag/spotify/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;could be causing you to share more personal data than you realize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a recent report from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8517869/when-you-listen-they-watch-pre-saving-albums-allow-labels-track-users-spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it was revealed that Spotify users were giving a band’s label data use permissions that were much broader than typical permissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a user pre-saves a track, it adds it to the user’s library the moment it comes out. In order to do this, Spotify users have to click through and approve certain permissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These permissions give the label more access to your account than Spotify normally gives. It allows them to track listening habits, change the artists they follow and potentially control their streaming remotely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A lot of the time we click through these permissions without really knowing what we’re agreeing to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altpress.com/news/spotify-overpaid-songwriters/&quot;&gt;Spotify claims it “overpaid” songwriters in 2018 and they want it back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could soon spark some concern considering these permissions grant access to data normally used exclusively by Spotify themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, Billboard points out Little Mix track “Bounce Back” pre-saves prompted giving Sony Music specific permissions. Among them were “view your Spotify account data,” “view your activity on Spotify” and “take actions in Spotify on your behalf.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The exact permissions were only visible if the user clicked through the corresponding submenus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altpress.com/news/spotify-your-library-redesign-splits-music-podcasts/&quot;&gt;Spotify introduces Your Library redesign, splits music and podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Tinker, a media analyst with Gabelli &amp;amp; Company, explains, “I’m not sure if most people realize that. There’s nothing they’re doing that’s illegal – it’s just that no one ever actually realizes when they sign off on these things what they mean.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Add and remove items in your Library” is the only permission pre-save links really need. While permissions vary depending on label, Billboard reviewed dozens of campaigns to learn that Sony Music asks for the most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group ask for an additional 10 permissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These permissions strike me as expansive and beyond what a reasonable consumer would expect,” says Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies the ethical implementation of technology. “On the other hand, the larger picture is that as the Facebooks, Googles and Amazons of the world get so much data about people, every other company is just going to do the same. I can see why [the labels are] doing it: because they fear if they aren’t as aggressive as Google and Facebook they’re going to lose a competitive advantage.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in May,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.9c6fdd6a26c7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;reported that Spotify was one of the iPhone apps that used data trackers to send info about users and devices to third parties in the middle of the night while users slept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think Spotify could do a lot better. And they ought to be clearer about the nature of consent,” Pasquale says. “Individual consumer action will change nothing. Most people are just too busy to hear about this problem and act on their own. Regulators have to step in and be aggressive in terms of punishing things that are clearly unfair or deceptive and making sure there are some basic standards that are met.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)&quot; title=&quot;Cell (biology)&quot;&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; to these radiation levels rapidly (within 20–40 minutes of exposure) altered the chemical properties of its melanin, and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer (measured as reduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferricyanide&quot; title=&quot;Ferricyanide&quot;&gt;ferricyanide&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADH&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;NADH&quot;&gt;NADH&lt;/a&gt;) three- to four-fold compared with unexposed cells.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dadachova_2-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotrophic_fungus#cite_note-Dadachova-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Non-ionizing&quot;&gt;non-ionizing&lt;/a&gt; radiation, suggesting that melanotic fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Comparisons_with_non-melanized_fungi&quot;&gt;Comparisons with non-melanized fungi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanization may come at some metabolic cost to the fungal cells. In the absence of radiation, some non-melanized fungi (that had been mutated in the melanin pathway) grew faster than their melanized counterparts. Limited uptake of nutrients due to the melanin molecules in the fungal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall&quot; title=&quot;Cell wall&quot;&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt; or toxic intermediates formed in melanin biosynthesis have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dadachova_2-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotrophic_fungus#cite_note-Dadachova-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is consistent with the observation that despite being capable of producing melanin, many fungi do not synthesize melanin constitutively (i.e., all the time), but often only in response to external stimuli or at different stages of their development.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Calvo_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotrophic_fungus#cite_note-Calvo-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The exact biochemical processes in the suggested melanin-based synthesis of organic compounds or other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite&quot; title=&quot;Metabolite&quot;&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt; for fungal growth, including the chemical intermediates (such as native electron donor and acceptor molecules) in the fungal cell and the location and chemical products of this process, are unknown.
