<title>Being kind to others is good for your health</title>
<link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201215-why-being-kind-to-others-is-good-for-your-health</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201215-why-being-kind-to-others-is-good-for-your-health</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;For Tristen Inagaki, neuroscientist at San Diego State University, there is nothing surprising in the fact that kindness and altruism should impact our physical wellbeing. “Humans are extremely social, we have better health when we are interconnected, and part of being interconnected is giving,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;Inagaki studies our caregiving system – a network of brain regions tied to both helping behaviours and health. This system likely evolved to facilitate parenting of our infants, unusually helpless by mammalian standards, and later probably got co-opted to helping other people, too. Part of the system is made up from the reward regions of the brain, such as the septal area and ventral striatum – the very same ones that light up when you get three cherries in a row on a slot machine. By wiring parenting to the reward system, nature has tried to assure we don’t run away from our screaming, needy babies. Neuroimagining studies by Inagaki and her colleagues show that these brain areas also light up &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsz052/5527421&quot;&gt;when we give support to other loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;Besides making caregiving rewarding, evolution also linked it with reduced stress. When we act kindly, or even simply reflect on our past kindness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsz052/5527421&quot;&gt;the activity of our brain’s fear centre, the amygdala, goes down&lt;/a&gt;. Again this could be linked to raising children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;It may seem counterintuitive that childcare might be stress-reducing – ask any new parent and they’ll likely tell you that caring for babies isn’t exactly a trip to the spa. But research shows that when animals hear the whimpers of infants of the same species, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763415001001&quot;&gt;activity of their amygdalae tempers down&lt;/a&gt;, and the same thing happens to parents when they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29749102/&quot;&gt;shown the photo of their own child&lt;/a&gt;. Inagaki explains that the activity of the brain’s fear centre has to go down if we are to be truly useful to others. “If you were completely overwhelmed by their stress, you probably couldn’t even approach them to help them in the first place,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9,000-Year-Old Stonehenge-Like Structure Found Under Lake Michigan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists found something much more fascinating than they got credit for when searching under the waters of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan&quot;&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; for shipwrecks: they uncovered a rock with a prehistoric carving of a mastodon, as well as a collection of stones arranged in a Stonehenge-like manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gazing into the water&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern archaeology, the use of remote sensing techniques is common: scientists regularly survey lakes and soil for hidden objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-block code-block-1&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5568326865709567&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8787383485&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-full-width-responsive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists uncovered sunken boats and cars and even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/civil-war-era-ships-that-collided-sank-in-1878-found-in-lake-michigan.html&quot;&gt;Civil War-era pier&lt;/a&gt; at a depth of around 40 feet into Lake Michigan’s Grand Traverse Bay, using sonar techniques to search for shipwrecks,  but among all these, they found this prehistoric surprise, which a trained eye can guess by looking at the sonar scans photos in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11771&quot; srcset=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-2-1.jpg 640w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-2-1-300x188.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see it in the water, you’re tempted to say this is absolutely real,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsaw.com/authors/Mark-Holley/&quot;&gt;Mark Holley&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of underwater archaeology at Northwestern Michigan University College who made the discovery, during a news conference with photos of the boulder on display in 2007. “But that’s what we need the experts to come in and verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-block code-block-2&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-layout-key=&quot;-hq-17-12-4m+ml&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5568326865709567&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2187397685&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; src=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11769&quot; srcset=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-5-1.jpg 800w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-5-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-5-1-768x431.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Mark Holley hopes that a computer model of the carving in the mastodon rock will help petroglyph experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boulder with the markings is 3.5 to 4 feet high and about 5 feet long. Photos show a surface with numerous fissures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may be natural while others appear of human origin, but those forming what could be the petroglyph stood out, Holley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed together, they suggest the outlines of a mastodon-like back, hump, head, trunk, tusk, triangular-shaped ear and parts of legs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We couldn’t believe what we were looking at,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_MacMaster&quot;&gt;Greg MacMaster&lt;/a&gt;, president of the underwater preserve council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-block code-block-3&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5568326865709567&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8787383485&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-full-width-responsive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialists shown pictures of the boulder holding the mastodon markings have asked for more evidence before confirming the markings are an ancient petroglyph, said Holley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to actually see it,” he said. Unfortunately, he added, “Experts in petroglyphs generally don’t dive, so we’re running into a little bit of a stumbling block there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If found to be true, the wannabe petroglyph could be as much as 10,000 years old – coincident with the post-Ice Age presence of both humans and mastodons in the upper midwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; src=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11767&quot; srcset=&quot;https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-4-1.jpg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.40/fbx.00e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/michigan-stonehenge-4-1-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stones of discovered underwater structure are organised circle and believe to be at least 10,000 years old.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code-block code-block-5&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5568326865709567&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8787383485&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-full-width-responsive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation, if authenticated, wouldn’t be completely out of place. Stone circles and other petroglyph sites are located in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made back a few years ago, and surprisingly enough the find hasn’t been popularized at all, with little to no information available online, but I’ll be sure to update this post as soon as I can get ahold of more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 9:33 p.m. ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has retracted the core of its hit 2018 podcast series &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; after an internal review found the paper failed to heed red flags indicating that the man it relied upon for its narrative about the allure of terrorism could not be trusted to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper has reassigned its star terrorism reporter, Rukmini Callimachi, who hosted the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; relayed the tale about the radicalization of a young Canadian who went to Syria, joined the Islamic State and became an executioner for the extremist group before escaping its hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian authorities this fall &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/7350363/rcmp-arrests-abu-huzayfah-for-faking-past/&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the man, Shehroze Chaudhry, of lying about those activities. He currently faces criminal charges in a federal court in Ontario of perpetrating a terrorism hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We fell in love with the fact that we had gotten a member of ISIS who would describe his life in the caliphate and would describe his crimes,&quot; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dean Baquet tells NPR in an interview on Thursday. &quot;I think we were so in love with it that when we saw evidence that maybe he was a fabulist, when we saw evidence that he was making some of it up, we didn't listen hard enough.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly produced series was announced to much fanfare in March 2018 at the South By Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas, as a worthy complement to the paper's hit news podcast, &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; represents the modern &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.nytco.com/news-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2018/THE-NEW-YORK-TIMES-ANNOUNCES-FIRST-NARRATIVE-NONFICTION-PODCAST-CALIPHATE-WITH-RUKMINI-CALLIMACHI/default.aspx&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in unveiling the project. &quot;It's ambitious, rigorous, hard-nosed reporting combined with first-rate digital storytelling. We're taking our audience to dangerous places they have never been, and we're doing it with more transparency than we ever have before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; made a huge splash for &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, winning awards, acclaim, new listeners for its podcasts and new paying subscribers. And it further propelled Callimachi into the journalistic stratosphere. In vivid and visceral detail, Chaudhry, speaking under the pseudonym Abu Huzayfah, told Callimachi and her colleagues of the atrocities he witnessed in Syria and of his involvement in execution-style killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a coup for the newspaper and its reporter focusing on terrorism, a notoriously difficult subject to cover. &quot;He gave us a gift with the story,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1237181507751/&quot;&gt;Callimachi told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.&lt;/a&gt; in May 2018 as &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; episodes were being released. &quot;It's an eye-opening account of his passage through the Islamic State.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gift proved tainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On multiple occasions prior to the release of the podcast, Chaudhry had told Canadian news outlets that he had traveled to Syria in 2014 and joined ISIS. But he had denied playing any role in killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-secondary-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Callimachi and the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; however, he claimed he had conducted executions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; posted the episode in which Chaudhry described killing two civilians, an uproar ensued in Canada. On the floor of Parliament in Ottawa, a leading opposition lawmaker, Candice Bergen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourcommons.ca/embed/en/i/10130417/?ml=en&amp;amp;vt=watch&quot;&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's efforts to reintegrate former terrorists into society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This guy is apparently in Toronto,&quot; Bergen said, referring to Chaudhry. &quot;Canadians deserve more answers from their government. Why is it not doing something about this despicable animal walking around the country?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaudhry came forward and once again denied he had participated in any killings — that is, he denied what he had said, in his own words, on tape, to Callimachi and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. Even so, in 2019, the podcast series was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/rukmini-callimachi-new-york-times&quot;&gt;finalist for the Pulitzer Prize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/caliphate&quot;&gt;won a Peabody&lt;/a&gt;, one of the highest distinctions in broadcast journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian media and a handful of critics in the U.S., notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/30/rukmini-callimachis-reporting-troubles/&quot;&gt;Erik Wemple of The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hxhassan/status/1309611666418659329&quot;&gt;Hassan Hassan of Newlines magazine&lt;/a&gt;, raised significant questions about Callimachi's judgment and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/28/subject-nyt-caliphate-podcast-series-charged-with-perpetrating-hoax/&quot;&gt;the accuracy of her reporting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; resisted revisiting Chaudhry's story until his arrest this fall, when Canadian officials charged him with lying about participating in terrorist activities. It then published the findings into Chaudhry's activities by its distinguished national security reporter, Mark Mazzetti, who cast significant doubt on the Canadian's claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate internal review of &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;'s reporting process was led by senior investigative editor Dean Murphy. He found that Callimachi and her editors repeatedly failed to push hard enough to verify Chaudhry's claims, Baquet tells NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They came back and said, 'If you look at the guy's story, there is not enough powerful evidence that he was who he claimed to be for us to justify that story,' &quot; Baquet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview with NPR lasting nearly an hour, Baquet says the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; did not have evidence Chaudhry had ever been to Syria. Nor could it show he had joined ISIS, much less killed civilians for the group. The man's account proved to be riddled with holes and contradictions. Even when confronting some of them, the reporting and producing team sought ways to show his story could still turn out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet says top editors long accustomed to editing complex written investigative pieces were deferential to an ambitious audio investigative team presenting a compelling narrative yarn. He says he shares in that blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought we produced another, you know, 'Holy damn!' story,&quot; Baquet recalled. &quot;I was really proud of it. Another big story to embrace and applaud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callimachi, a noted terrorism correspondent, has won some of the most distinguished honors in foreign reporting and is a four-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She joined the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2014 after spending seven years covering Africa for The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet says editors relied on Callimachi's judgment to guide their own when it came to &lt;em&gt;Caliphate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;She's a powerful reporter who we imbued with a great deal of power and authority,&quot; he says. &quot;She was regarded at that moment as, you know, as big a deal ISIS reporter as there was in the world. And there's no question that that was one of the driving forces of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet notes that Callimachi had broken many stories and says that Murphy had found there had been no dishonesty or attempt by the &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; team to deceive editors or readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, Baquet is posting an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/podcasts/caliphate-transcript-chapter-ten-one-year-later.html&quot;&gt;editor's note&lt;/a&gt; atop each element of &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; saying the series should never have been produced with Chaudhry as a central character. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also writes that the series did not meet its standards for accuracy or fact-checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; did not remove the episodes from its site or feeds. Asked whether its actions constitute a retraction, Baquet pauses and says, &quot;I guess for the parts that were about Chaudhry and his history and his background. Yeah, I think it is. Sure does.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet also acknowledges that Murphy's review will yield additional corrections of Callimachi's past work. However, he says nothing rose to the level of the mistakes in judgment made in &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callimachi declined to speak to NPR for this story. Late Friday morning, she posted a statement to her Twitter account expressing pride in her past reporting on ISIS but apologized to listeners, calling the lapses &quot;humbling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thinking of the colleagues and the newsroom I let down is gutting,&quot; Callimachi wrote. &quot;I caught the subject of our podcast lying about key aspects of his account and reported that. I also didn't catch other lies he told us, and I should have.&quot; She wrote that she committed to doing better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Callimachi defended narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questions were first raised about the podcast, however, Callimachi dismissed criticism of the validity of her series by saying only her team had been able to get the truth from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were able to get to him both before any other media had gotten to him, but crucially, before law enforcement had gotten to him,&quot; she told the CBC in May 2018, the day after the release of Chapter 5, in which Chaudhry described stabbing a man in the heart repeatedly. &quot;He would speak to us in this window of time when he essentially thought that he had slipped through the cracks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, as Canadian authorities were wrapping up an investigation on Chaudhry, Callimachi similarly championed her series. On Twitter, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1309625183079202820&quot;&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about the competence of Canadian intelligence officials in the Chaudhry case. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/28/subject-nyt-caliphate-podcast-series-charged-with-perpetrating-hoax/&quot;&gt;defended her piece&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and others, saying the reporting proved to be true and that doubts about Chaudhry's account were central to the podcast's narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those doubts were acknowledged at the outset and surfaced most fundamentally in the sixth installment, in which Callimachi and her team confronted fundamental problems in Chaudhry's timeline of his activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the episode was an effort to figure out how the pieces of his story might fit together — if the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; was willing to shift the dates involved. One audio editor described that scenario as &quot;Occam's razor,&quot; suggesting that it was the simplest resolution to their dilemma and therefore probably the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callimachi also relied on corroboration from her colleagues Eric Schmitt, Adam Goldman and others that U.S. and Canadian intelligence officials harbored a suspicion — in some cases even a belief — that Chaudhry might have joined ISIS. But it wasn't clear whether those officials relied on hard evidence to verify Chaudhry's story or his own past claims on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In posting real-time analyses on social media about unfolding terrorism attacks, Callimachi has helped to cement her reputation as a leading source on terrorism. Indeed she has frequently appeared on NPR and other networks as an analyst. Many colleagues consider her a fearless force of nature, chasing stories, sources and documents in far-flung places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she also has detractors, even within her own newsroom. Some editors and reporters on the &lt;em&gt;Times'&lt;/em&gt; foreign desk kept their distance, according to colleagues who spoke on the condition they not be named due to the sensitivity of the topic. In one case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/world/middleeast/isis-leader-al-baghdadi.html&quot;&gt;a scoop required a subsequent editor's note&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/world/middleeast/islamic-state-receipts-debate.html&quot;&gt;a full follow-up story&lt;/a&gt; to address doubts about the veracity of the documents she relied upon. In another, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; disclosed it had bought video footage that included terrorist propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Baquet and Managing Editor Joseph Kahn, a former top international editor, stood behind her. Dolnick, a scion of the Sulzberger family, which has a controlling stake in the New York Times Co., personally encouraged her role and took on oversight of the &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; project. As Callimachi served as the heroic figure of &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;, on a quest for truth, audio producer Andy Mills, who helped to develop &lt;em&gt;The Daily,&lt;/em&gt; emerged as a recurring character as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet declines to say whether other &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; journalists would receive reprimands or be reassigned as a result of the internal review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he would work with Callimachi to determine a fresh assignment and praised her recent investigation on the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not see how Rukmini could go back to covering terrorism after one of the highest-profile stories of terrorism is getting knocked down in this way,&quot; Baquet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1340066958507606016&quot;&gt;offered to return the Peabody Award&lt;/a&gt; and the awards' executive director accepted. The Overseas Press Club also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/opcofamerica/status/1340020604880216066&quot;&gt;rescinded&lt;/a&gt; its Lowell Thomas Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baquet points to media columnist Ben Smith's October &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html&quot;&gt;look at the controversy&lt;/a&gt; as part of what he says is a push for transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has done tremendously ambitious journalism over the last few years. All of it has held up to the greater scrutiny,&quot; Baquet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we get it wrong, I want people to understand we're going to talk about it,&quot; he continues. &quot;And what I'm hoping is that by talking about it, people will understand that we want to win their trust. And we want them to believe what we report.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Medicine apologized on Friday for its vaccine distribution plan – a plan that came under fire for leaving out nearly all of its medical residents and fellows, many whom regularly treat COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residents waged a protest on Friday morning, holding signs and demanding answers from Stanford's leadership about why just seven of more than 1,300 residents at Stanford were selected to receive the vaccine in the first round of 5,000 doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A council composed of the chief residents sent a letter to Stanford's leadership on Thursday night expressing anger and disappointment as they had learned that residents and fellows would not be a priority in the first allocation. Residents are doctors in training, who have graduated from medical school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many of us know senior faculty who have worked from home since the pandemic began in March 2020, with no in-person patient responsibilities, who were selected for vaccination. In the meantime, we residents and fellows strap on N95 masks for the tenth month of this pandemic without a transparent and clear plan for our protection in place. While leadership is pointing to an error in an algorithm meant to ensure equity and justice, our understanding is this error was identified on Tuesday and a decision was made not to revise the vaccine allocation scheme before its release today,&quot; they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Friday's protests and subsequent media attention, the leaders of Stanford Health Care and Stanford School of Medicine sent an email to staff that apologized for the debacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are writing to acknowledge the significant concerns expressed by our community regarding the development and execution of our vaccine distribution plan. We take complete responsibility and profusely apologize to all of you. We fully recognize we should have acted more swiftly to address the errors that resulted in an outcome we did not anticipate,&quot; they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are working quickly to address the flaws in our plan and develop a revised version,&quot; the executives and deans wrote. They said they anticipate being able to vaccinate &quot;a substantial segment of our community&quot; once a larger shipment of vaccines arrives, hopefully next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university did not make clear what the process will be now for the first round of doses, the first of which were administered Friday. Residents tell NPR that the system has become chaotic, with some residents able to walk up and receive the vaccine, while others have been told to wait. Some faculty members have pledged to give their vaccine to residents instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an email sent by a chief resident to other residents, Stanford's leaders explained that an algorithm was used to assign its first allotment of the vaccine. The algorithm was said to have prioritized those health care workers at highest risk for COVID infections, along with factors like age and the location or unit where they work in the hospital. Residents apparently did not have an assigned location, and along with their typically young age, they were dropped low on the priority list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-secondary-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford has not provided an answer to NPR's request for an explanation of its process or its algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurology residents were among those who organized and protested on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neurology resident, who was involved in planning Friday's protest, said that a flawed algorithm is no excuse. She requested anonymity for fear of affecting her future job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[A]lgorithms are made by people and the results ... were reviewed multiple times by people,&quot; she wrote in an email to NPR. &quot;The ones who ultimately approved the decisions are responsible. If this is an oversight, even if unintentional, it speaks volumes about how the front line staff and residents are perceived: an afterthought, only after we've protested. There's an utter disconnect between the administrators and the front line workers. This is also reflective that no departmental chair or chief resident was involved in the decision making process.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook: Free as in Bullshit</title>
<link>https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/facebook_free_as_in_bullshit</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/facebook_free_as_in_bullshit</guid>
<description>&lt;h6 class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;Friday, 18 December 2020&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s second full-page newspaper ad attacking Apple, helpfully transcribed (and photographed) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/17/facebook-runs-apple-vs-free-internet-ad/&quot;&gt;by MacRumors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple vs. the free internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple plans to roll out a forced software update that will change the internet as we know it — for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your favorite cooking sites or sports blogs. Most are free because they show advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an unfortunate quirk of the English language that &lt;em&gt;free as freedom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;free as in beer&lt;/em&gt; are very different meanings of &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;. But when you see an ad headlined “Apple vs. The Free Internet”, most people would assume they’re about to hear an argument about &lt;em&gt;free as in freedom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Facebook. They’re arguing about &lt;em&gt;free as in beer&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, they’re alleging that Apple is taking away freedom — the freedom of small business advertisers to benefit from unrestricted tracking for ad targeting — but their argument to the public is that such privacy initiatives will cost users their free beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing “forced” about the software update Facebook is talking about either, which, I think, is going to be iOS 14.4. It’s actually quite interesting that Apple does not force software updates, or perform them in a hard-to-disable-or-detect manner. What’s “forced” isn’t the software update, but Facebook’s compliance with new rules that they wish they could ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s change will limit their ability to run personalized ads. To make ends meet, many will have to start charging you subscription fees or adding more in-app purchases, making the internet much more expensive and reducing high-quality free content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we talking about apps or websites? This is a very short ad — I haven’t omitted a word in my blockquoted text — but it suddenly veers from “cooking sites or sports blogs” to “in-app purchases” without explaining how it got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple clearly has no control over anything related to the advertising on websites, other than whatever privacy controls are built into Safari. Apple isn’t limiting the ability of &lt;em&gt;apps&lt;/em&gt; on iOS to show personalized ads, either. They’re also not limiting the ability of ad-tracking technology to track users. What they’re doing is giving users awareness of and control over that tracking. In broad terms, changing tracking from opt-out to opt-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may well result in diminishing the effectiveness of personalized advertising. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2020/09/online_privacy_real_world_privacy&quot;&gt;If so, so be it&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s argument is along the lines of arguing that the police shouldn’t crack down on burglaries because doing so might hurt pawn shops that have been thriving during a years-long crime spree. The information used for tracking belongs to the users whose behavior and interests is being tracked, not to Facebook and the companies, no matter how small and noble, who advertise with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fair!&lt;/em&gt; claims the company objecting to blinds being installed on windows it had long peered through unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond hurting apps and websites, many in the small business community say this change will be devastating for them too, at a time when they face enormous challenges. They need to be able to effectively reach the people most interested in their products and services to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the pandemic waterworks. How dare Apple institute improved privacy controls during a severe recession. Boo-fucking-hoo. I do give some credit to Facebook for putting it so plainly that they’re claiming they need to invade our privacy without our awareness or permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-four percent of small to medium businesses started or increased their usage of personalized ads on social media during the pandemic, according to a new Deloitte study. Without personalized ads, Facebook data shows that the average small business advertiser stands to see a cut of over 60% in their sales for every dollar they spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well if Facebook says so, it must be true. If only anyone could remember a time when advertising wasn’t based on privacy-invasive tracking, we could know whether there were any successful small businesses back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole ad reads more like an ad &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Apple’s privacy initiatives than against them. Apple’s response to this campaign is simply to show the very simple easily-understood opt-in dialog box that Facebook is objecting to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1339350618335428612&quot;&gt;Apple’s entire statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s illustrated with this example permission dialog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/misc/2020/12/facebook-tracking-example.png&quot; class=&quot;noborder&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/misc/2020/12/facebook-tracking-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example ad tracking permission dialog for Facebook.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; what Facebook is objecting to. Given that their privacy nutrition label &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1339689228549181440&quot;&gt;looks like this&lt;/a&gt;, you can almost sympathize.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California plan for wealth tax on anyone who spends 60 days a year in the state</title>
<link>https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-california-plan-to-chase-away-the-rich-then-keep-stalking-them-11608331448</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-california-plan-to-chase-away-the-rich-then-keep-stalking-them-11608331448</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;California’s Legislature is considering a wealth tax on residents, part-year residents, and any person who spends more than 60 days inside the state’s borders in a single year. Even those who move out of state would continue to be subject to the tax for a decade—a provision that calls to mind the Eagles’ famous “Hotel California” lyric: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Constitution probably allows a statewide wealth tax on residents, but any effort to create a tax capable of reaching across state borders is likely to run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Taxing someone who spends only 60 days in the state in any single year—and extending that tax over an ensuing decade—would be something new under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year this tax net would gather up a new crop of taxpayers for the next decade. The range of people it proposes to ensnare is staggering: every student attending college in California, anyone having a major medical procedure at a California hospital and needing an extended in-state recovery period, and those who spend two months in California away from New York or London winters. Under California tax law, there is no distinction between a nonresident from Minnesota and a nonresident from Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly Bill 2088 proposes calculating the wealth tax based on current world-wide net worth each Dec. 31. For part-year and temporary residents, the tax would be proportionate based on their number of days in California. The annual tax would be on current net worth and therefore would include wealth earned, inherited or obtained through gifts or estates long before and long after leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed wealth tax would fall on a star high-school or college athlete who grows up in California but becomes a wealthy professional in another state after graduation. It would grab a scientist who develops a drug to cure cancer years after leaving California. A grandchild who spent a single summer surfing in Southern California would be subject to the tax. It would include anyone returning home to a foreign country after 60 days in California.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How AltaVista, the first good search engine, fell into the digital abyss</title>
<link>https://tedium.co/2020/12/15/altavista-history-digital-dot-com-domain-name</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tedium.co/2020/12/15/altavista-history-digital-dot-com-domain-name</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-big&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today in Tedium:&lt;/strong&gt; A quarter-century ago, one of the first major search engines came to life on the internet as an experiment of sorts—a public test of a server manufacturer’s primary product that anyone with a web connection could take a part in. The experiment, for a time, proved more successful than anyone could have ever imagined. But the problem was, it was an experiment at heart that was never intended to be a business—and that meant better suited companies would eventually topple this innovation. Eventually, it would ensure that this cutting-edge idea would become a part of the past. But nobody is going to encase the innovations of 1995 and 1996 in amber on the internet: Time does not stand still, and neither do web sites, no matter how important they are or once were. But it would sure be nice if we could. It’s with that in mind that I write about AltaVista, Digital Equipment Corporation, web domains, and how important history can turn into the basis of some random company’s crass marketing scheme. Today’s Tedium, in honor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://1995blog.com/2015/12/15/remembering-launch-of-alta-vista-a-high-speed-system-for-finding-information-on-early-web/&quot;&gt;AltaVista’s 25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; this week, laments the loss of its original home to the gods of search engine optimization. Do not expect a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2020/05/15/search-engine-etiquette-backlinks/&quot;&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— Ernie @ Tedium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;md-redbox&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The combined size of the two hard drives&lt;/strong&gt; that Scooter and Turbo Vista, the machines that ran AltaVista, sported as of early 1996. (As tech legend Bob Metcalfe &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=zj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA50&quot;&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at that time, the two machines worked in tandem, with the more modest Scooter, with a 20-gigabyte hard drive and 1 gigabyte of RAM, fetching the pages, and Turbo Vista, with two gigs of RAM and a 250-gig hard drive, storing those findings and serving them up to web viewers.) The machines, which stored a modest amount of information between them by today’s standards, essentially existed to show off just what the DEC Alpha processor could do. In fact, that was the reason AltaVista existed in the first place: The person who came up with the idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/24/technology/paul-a-flaherty-a-developer-of-web-indexing-dies-at-42.html&quot;&gt;Paul Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, had been tasked with showing off the power of a new line of DEC computers, and had the spark while on vacation. It was eventually developed by DEC employees Michael Burrows and Louis Monier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/AltaVista-1996.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1281&quot; alt=&quot;Alta Vista 1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AltaVista, as it appeared in early 1997. (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3gRA9Y9&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How AltaVista, our first good search engine, fell into the digital abyss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Equipment Corporation survived for more than 40 years as an independent company, but it was a company built for an earlier era of computing—and while it adapted better than contemporaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2017/02/14/wang-computers-history-demise/&quot;&gt;like Wang Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, it ultimately began to struggle at the start of the 1990s, and ultimately could not find its footing into the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the way, less than three years before the company was sold off, DEC almost accidentally stumbled upon a mainstream web application that in many ways is more familiar to regular users than the groundbreaking PDP and VAX computer lines that the firm made its name on in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, DEC was one of the most important computer companies around. Founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957, the two former MIT researchers leveraged venture capital to build computers for industry—and found success by focusing on relatively small minicomputers over mainframes. DEC was an important company for computer history, but it missed out on trends as fundamental as the personal computer and (initially) the popularity of UNIX-based operating systems, and the company struggled to reshape its fortunes throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/DEC-Alpha-chip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;993&quot; alt=&quot;DEC Alpha chip&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the DEC Alpha chipset, of the kind used to power AltaVista. (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DEC_Alpha_21164.jpg&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltaVista came to life as a part of this turnaround effort, which starts with a processor line called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/dec/alpha&quot;&gt;DEC Alpha&lt;/a&gt;. The Alpha, a 64-bit RISC microprocessor line, was well-positioned to compete handily with major CPUs of the era from companies such as Intel and IBM on the speed front. It was a worthy competitor that gave DEC a chance to make a comeback, but price ultimately was the deciding factor for many buyers—and DEC couldn’t compete with the Intel Pentium on that front, at least in the desktop and workstation market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC, trying to kickstart things, needed a way to promote what the Alpha could do, and it was decided that a project to highlight the Alpha’s capabilities at chewing through a massive database was just the way to do it. And what better database to chew through than the World Wide Web? Hence, we got AltaVista, a shining example of what a struggling company’s server hardware could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC was not new to the internet—hardly. In 1985, the company registered one of the first commercial domains on the internet, DEC.com, as technology companies staked their claims for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2020/05/08/top-level-domain-history/&quot;&gt;top-level domains&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; name, registered in 1993, was the one that most users associated with DEC in the 1990s, thanks to AltaVista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3gRA9Y9&quot;&gt;www.altavista.digital.com&lt;/a&gt;, regular users could search the web for items with a degree of depth and sophistication that most other search engines could not offer at that time. It was groundbreaking: Someone had built an internet search engine that treated the internet with the respect it deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did AltaVista lose? Well, while it was a great idea for a marketing tool, it was almost as if DEC didn’t realize that the search engine was a worthy business on its own until it was too late. Which meant that after they built the thing, they naturally would face competition from companies that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; understand this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2018/10/02/google-20th-anniversary-culture-importance/&quot;&gt;like its eventual conqueror Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/03/business/digital-faces-tough-market-for-altavista.html&quot;&gt;A September 1996 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article described it as such&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By floating Altavista, analysts said, Digital is hoping to receive more recognition for developing a cutting-edge Internet technology. That could boost sales of Digital computers much the way Sun Microsystems has benefited from its development of the red-hot Java computer language, even though Java itself has generated relatively little profit, and Sun has so far announced no plans to spin it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Sun comparison is apt, though Sun was far more adept at figuring out what to do with Java than Digital ever was with AltaVista.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/38a2rcn&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2005 book on the rise of Google and the search engine in general, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; cofounder John Battelle blamed a corporate culture that didn’t know how to handle having its kind of innovation under its roof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow from the present, AltaVista was the Google of its era. In 1996, it was arguably the best and most-loved brand on the Web. It presaged many of the current innovations and opportunities in search, from automatic language translation to audio and video search to clustering of results. And as a business AltaVista attempted—and failed—to go public three times in three short years under three different owners. Possibly most instructive, AltaVista was the product of a company that was an extraordinary success in its original business but ultimately failed because of hidebound management unwilling to drive by anything other than the rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, despite being the most popular search engine as recently as 2000, a series of poor decisions—including the misguided and eventually reversed choice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technewsworld.com/story/1545.html&quot;&gt;to turn the search engine into a Yahoo!-style portal&lt;/a&gt;—ultimately ensured AltaVista would lose its place in the digital conversation. It was sold off multiple times, generally as part of a larger corporate segment, and by the time Yahoo! acquired AltaVista as a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2003/07/14/yahoo-to-buy-overture/&quot;&gt;its 2003 purchase of Overture Services&lt;/a&gt;, AltaVista had become yesterday’s news, disconnected from the domain name that had berthed it years prior, and ultimately forgotten about by most regular internet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last decade of its life, it was essentially a shell of its former self at Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-redbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced an ongoing effort to sharpen our focus and deliver experiences that enhance your daily lives. As part of that, today we’re shutting down a few products so we can continue to focus on creating beautiful products that are essential to you every day.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Yahoo!, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/54125001066/keeping-our-focus-on-whats-next&quot;&gt;a 2013 announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—deep in the Marissa Mayer era of the company—that it was shutting down AltaVista. (If you visit altavista.com, it redirects to Yahoo! Search.) The shutdown &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkeffect.allthingsd.com/20101216/following-layoffs-yahoo-cuts-products-mybloglog-delicious-yahoo-buzz/&quot;&gt;had long been rumored&lt;/a&gt;, first appearing in a slide by the company’s chief product officer suggesting things that should be shut down to consolidate the company’s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/digital-dot-com-1996.jpg&quot; width=&quot;954&quot; height=&quot;802&quot; alt=&quot;Digital dot com 1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt;, as it appeared in 1996. (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why, as an internet user who cares about history, you shouldn’t visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn about DEC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, AltaVista and DEC are two dusty segments of internet history, things that don’t see the light of day very often. But it’s worth noting the irony that the best way to learn about AltaVista in 2020 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; through the top result of a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do a search for AltaVista on the web at this time, the first result that comes up is for a site called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; (note: all links to this site intentionally link to the 1996 Internet Archive version of the page). Rocking the headline “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2WocZyY&quot;&gt;AltaVista Search Engine History Lesson For Internet Nerds&lt;/a&gt;” (linked via the Internet Archive for reasons I’ll explain below), you might think that this historical research project is noble in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a professionally written article, it seems to be very insightful and informative in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, it’s something of an internet bottom-feeder. It exists primarily to help create a top-of-funnel stream of content for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt;’s primary goal in 2020—a site focused publishing AI-driven software reviews that it can then make money from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; did not start like this—first registered in 1993 by DEC, the site was the second home of the company, after DEC.com. But DEC, like its most famous consumer product, passed through a few hands as it faded out of view. In 1998, the company, which saw its minicomputer offerings fall into a tailspin that the Alpha processor line was unable to stop, was sold to Compaq. Compaq, in turn, had over-invested in the enterprise market and was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002, with parts of the legacy DEC splintering between HP and HP Enterprise when that company split in half in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/digital-dot-com-2020.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; alt=&quot;Digital dot com 2020&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt;, as it appears in 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of all this splintering, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; domain, which had been owned by HP for many years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedomains.com/2014/07/26/exclusive-interview-with-the-buyer-of-digital-com-richard-kershaw/&quot;&gt;was sold off in 2014&lt;/a&gt; after many attempts by the tech giant to get rid of it. In 2015, meanwhile, a firm named Review Squirrel got its start, and that company later acquired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; domain, soon taking that name for its company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, this historically important internet domain name—which hosted one of the first popular search engines—is now being used to launder some random company’s search engine presence, and if you search for AltaVista, DEC, or any piece of internet history related to Digital Equipment Corp., you’re essentially clicking on an ad for the former Review Squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a scholar of internet history and a noted hater of backlink schemes, and when I first learned of this site a few months ago—after receiving a backlink request from them, of course!—my brain nearly exploded. It was as if someone took everything I hate about the modern internet and combined it into one domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not publish unsolicited resources, sorry. I’m sure Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson would be excited to know that their company’s primary domain name was being used as a content factory,” I immediately quipped as soon as I got the email. (I of course, did not hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit: As of right now, there is nothing stopping owners of culturally important domains from preventing their future reuse in non-respectable ways. For example, TheFrisky, once a popular women’s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/who-owns-the-frisky&quot;&gt;now leverages its near-decade worth of search traffic&lt;/a&gt; as a cudgel, taking advantage of its decaying cultural role to help push up the identity of a Serbian music producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; isn’t arguably doing anything as sketchy as that, but it is doing something that I find equally as distasteful—it’s leveraging a bedrock piece of internet history in an effort to help push up its own marketing presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2019/10/17/historic-websites-preservation/&quot;&gt;I wrote about why websites with strong historic relevance&lt;/a&gt; should gain some sort of protection from this kind of thing, citing the way that Yahoo! had frequently mistreated its properties throughout its history as one reason for that. Yahoo! is only a side player in the saga of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt;, but I think its story nonetheless reflects the same general issue: Businesses do not care about history unless it’s something they can monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; treats history as the top of the funnel, but you should see how dark the bottom of that funnel gets. It’s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-graybox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a way, I’m glad &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/37ot8Ln&quot;&gt;Digital.com&lt;/a&gt; exists,&lt;/strong&gt; even though I hate everything about what it represents. It’s as strong of evidence as I can find in favor of my argument that we need a way to protect dormant but historically important domain names from being reused for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows what happens when large companies prioritize a quick buck over an important legacy. You can argue that HP had its hands on the internet equivalent of a Honus Wagner baseball card and decided the responsible corporate thing to do was to see what happened if it put the card up for auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ll tell you what happens—there’s a chance that someone without a lot of respect for the history gets a hold of it and decides to take the card out of its plastic case just because they can. And honestly, that scares me, and it’s something I fear someday might happen again with an even more valuable card.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Great American Rail Trail</title>
<link>http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20201213-a-new-way-to-travel-across-the-us</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20201213-a-new-way-to-travel-across-the-us</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Ryan Gardill used to love backpacking. Getting into the outdoors and covering ground was one of the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, native’s favourite things to do. But as the 29-year-old former US Marine’s joints and back began struggling to carry the weight of a backpack, he decided it was time to get on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opened up a whole new world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d always dreamed of doing a thru-hike or bike,” he said. “A guy from work talked about a trail going from Pittsburgh to DC. I said: ‘That sounds awesome!’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in August, Gardill and his colleague embarked on a 350-mile journey, pedalling across converted railroad trails from western Pennsylvania to Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Great American Rail-Trail is the most ambitious biking initiative the country has ever seen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passing through Pennsylvania, Maryland and DC, Gardill’s trip may seem like a major undertaking. Yet it’s just a small fraction of an unprecedented new scenic pathway aiming to traverse the United States from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstotrails.org/greatamericanrailtrail/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Great American Rail-Trail&lt;/a&gt; is the most ambitious biking initiative the country has ever seen. Stretching an extraordinary 3,700 miles from the nation’s capital across 12 states to the Pacific Ocean, west of Seattle, it’s an idea that’s been ruminating for 50 years. The Rail-Trail will connect more than 125 existing multi-use paths, greenways, trails and towpaths. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://gis.railstotrails.org/grtamerican/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official route&lt;/a&gt; was announced to the public in May 2019 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstotrails.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rails-to-Trails Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; (RTC), the Washington DC-based non-profit leading the effort, when the trail was already more than half completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Determining the route was a 30-year journey,” said Brandi Horton, vice-president of communications at the RTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail is largely built atop or next to abandoned railway lines (hence the name) with surfaces ranging from crushed stone to smooth asphalt. These railbanks – abandoned railway corridors converted into trails – account for more than 24,000 miles of multi-use trails crisscrossing the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it is fully completed – estimated to be before 2040 – almost one in six Americans will live within 50 miles of the route, and it will offer an unparalleled experience of the country people can’t see from 36,000ft or through a car window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing couldn’t be better. According to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstotrails.org/resource-library/resources/new-data-underscores-need-for-safe-places-to-walk-and-bike-close-to-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RTC study&lt;/a&gt;, in spring, trail use across the US spiked by 200%, in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic. With team sports and gyms mostly off people’s minds now and for the foreseeable future, the boom in outdoor, physically distanced activities such as cycling and hiking is expected to last for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want rail-trails to be America’s Main Street &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think [the pandemic] demonstrated to a lot of officials that access to the outdoors actually is key. Creating these connections is really critical,” said Horton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the vision for the coast-to-coast trail isn’t just utilitarian; it’s a way to reveal how the US’ diverse tapestry of communities fit together, and how the country’s past connects to its present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want rail-trails to be America’s Main Street,” the RTC’s co-founder David Burwell said back in 2006. Biking or hiking slowly across cities, towns and rural landscapes not only gives travellers a deeper understanding of local communities and cultures, but it also helps reveal the little-known histories that have contributed to the country’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the East Coast, the trail starts in downtown DC, passing a stone’s throw from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/museums&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Museums&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/nama/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Mall&lt;/a&gt; before heading north-west across Maryland. There, hikers and cyclists can overnight at a series of 19th-Century &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canaltrust.org/programs/canal-quarters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lockhouses&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chesapeake &amp;amp; Ohio Canal&lt;/a&gt;, an Industrial Revolution marvel that played a pivotal role in providing troops’ supplies during the US Civil War. In the 1800s, these buildings were home to lockkeepers who collected canal tolls on the Appalachian lumber and coal that helped fuel the US’ westward expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the towns on the trail were once important areas to the future of America, only to be forgotten in time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gardill, there are also dozens of open-ground camping “cut-outs” that have water wells and toilets along the rural sections of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canaltrust.org/plan/co-canal-towpath/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;O Canal’s Towpath&lt;/a&gt;, which runs 184.5 miles between DC’s Georgetown neighbourhood and Cumberland, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Gardill and his cycling buddy, a day on the trail would start at around 07:00 with coffee and breakfast. They’d then ride until 11:00, pedal into a local town and get some lunch. “We’d never pass up an opportunity for a beer, so we ended up stopping at five breweries,” he said. They’d get back on the trail and cycle until four in the afternoon before stopping, setting up camp and settling in for a night under the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardill’s expedition saw him cross the Eastern Continental Divide close to the 3,118ft-long Paw Paw Canal Tunnel in Allegany County, Maryland. Eighty miles west, on the banks of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers that cut through the Blue Ridge Mountains, is the steep, cobblestoned town of Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia – the furthest point north reached by Confederate forces during the Civil War and where abolitionist John Brown famously attempted to start a slave revolt in 1859 . “It’s absolutely beautiful. It’s like time has not touched the town since the 1700s,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trail connected me to [the US’] revolutionary and industrial history, as every town is filled with historical areas,” Gardill added. “Most of the towns on the trail were once important areas to the future of America, only to be forgotten in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For him, part of the attraction of thru-biking is its simplicity. As well as a tent and sleeping bag, Gardill packed a portable burner to cook dehydrated meals, water bottles and water purifiers. “If you have a tent and a sleeping bag and a bike, you’re really set,” he said. He also recommends bringing along spare bike tubes, patch kits and a bike tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those heading west, the trail passes through the heart of Ohio’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ohiosamishcountry.com/articles/where-time-stands-still-the-swartzentruber-amish&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swartzentruber Amish&lt;/a&gt; country, a community that completely eschews modern technology and continues to speak Pennsylvania German as their first language. In hollowed-out Rust Belt towns fighting to get back on their feet, the echoes of thriving manufacturing communities once linked by rail in south-west Pennsylvania and Indiana tell the story of boom-and-bust capitalism. Further west, the trail crosses the Mississippi River that famously inspired Mark Twain and has long shaped the US’ history and culture at Moline, Illinois, before spanning the Continental Divide in Montana. In Idaho, encounters with moose and other wildlife aren’t uncommon along the historic Coeur d’Alene trail that was carved out of mountainous rock by gold prospectors seeking their fortune in the mid-19th Century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearing the route’s end, the ferry trip crossing the Puget Sound in Seattle is another highlight, as travellers pass through a region once home to thriving Suquamish, Duwamish, Nisqually, Snoqualmie and Muckleshoot Native American settlements before skirting the northern fringes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Olympic National Park&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest temperate rainforests in the country. The lapping waters of the Pacific Ocean greet you at La Push, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the broader health benefits of spending time outdoors are well-documented, trails along the “Great American”, as it’s known, are already playing a key role in helping revitalise economies in dozens of post-industrial towns across the US Heartland: Steubenville and Dayton in Ohio; Muncie, Indiana and Joliet, Illinois, all have burgeoning brewery scenes situated close to the trail. The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy &lt;span&gt;estimates the trail could generate as much as $138bn &lt;/span&gt;for communities that build campsites, eateries and water and other adventure companies along the route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry, Iowa, population 7,676, is one such place. Built around a rail route that opened in 1869 and closed less than a century later, its railway line has since been repurposed for recreational hiking and biking. With the Great American now passing through the heart of town and future sections connecting it with neighbouring Illinois and Nebraska, locals are hoping it can contribute to a revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a huge thing and will bring many more people to Perry,” said Betsy Peterson, who runs an art and pottery business a five-minute walk from the trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may also be interested in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200429-americas-fried-chicken-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;America's 'fried chicken war'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170406-the-cuban-building-the-worlds-tallest-bike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cuban building the world's tallest bike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190530-the-alaska-town-where-money-grows-on-trees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Alaska town where money grows on trees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the street, the historical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotelpattee.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hotel Pattee&lt;/a&gt;, Perry’s landmark building, offers an indoor bike storage area as well as a repair station out front. “When people are out on a bike trip, it’s important they have some down time. I think Perry is a great place to stop and have a beer or a meal and relax,” added Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embarking on such a major undertaking, however, hasn’t been easy. Large sections of the trail, particularly across Wyoming, where only 2% is currently completed, are yet to be built or mapped out. The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy has taken on the mammoth task of working with trail planners, local and state agencies, elected officials and governors’ offices along the route that has involved 250 meetings held over 18 months in 2018 and 2019. About 300 trail plans were studied to determine the route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to be sure that the route would meet local and state needs, but that it would actually connect,” said Horton. “It was definitely a labour of love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while some western states have work to do, in places such as DC, Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania, more than 86% of the route is already open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on these quiet, forested trails where Gardill averaged 60 miles a day on his bike. Five days and two hours after setting off, he reached the National Mall in downtown DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Riding this trail has shown me that America is filled with the kindest people you can hope to meet,” he said. “You are always only a few miles from a good meal and a conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His next step? Doing it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, he said, “I couldn’t just do it once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you liked this story, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; called &quot;The Essential List&quot;.

<title>How Shopify Uses WebAssembly Outside of the Browser</title>
<link>https://shopify.engineering/shopify-webassembly</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shopify.engineering/shopify-webassembly</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Shopify we aim to make what most merchants need easy, and the rest possible. We make the rest possible by exposing interfaces to query, extend and alter our Platform. These interfaces empower a rich ecosystem of Partners to solve a variety of problems. The primary mechanism of this ecosystem is an “App”, an independently hosted web service which communicates with Shopify over the network. This model is powerful, but comes with a host of technical issues. Partners are stretched beyond their available resources as they have to build a web service that can operate at Shopify’s scale. Even if Partners’ resources were unlimited, the network latency incurred when communicating with Shopify precludes the use of Apps for time sensitive use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want Partners to focus on using their domain knowledge to solve problems, and not on managing scalable web services. To make this a reality we’re keeping the flexibility of untrusted Partner code, but executing it on our own infrastructure. We choose a universal format for that code that ensures it’s performant, secure, and flexible: WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is WebAssembly? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;WebAssembly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WebAssembly.org&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, see this series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;A cartoon intro to WebAssembly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;illustrated articles written by Lin Clark of Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; with information on WebAssembly and its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasm is often presented as a performant language that runs alongside JavaScript from within the Browser. We, however, execute Wasm outside of the browser and with no Javascript involved. Wasm, far from being solely a Javascript replacement, is designed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Non-Web Embeddings - WebAssembly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Web and Non-Web Embeddings alike&lt;/a&gt;. It solves the more general problem of performant execution in untrusted environments, which exists in browsers and code execution engines alike. Wasm satisfies our three main technical requirements: security, performance, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executing untrusted code is a dangerous thing—it's exceptionally difficult to predict by nature, and it has potential to cause harm to Shopify’s platform at large. While no application is entirely secure, we need to both prevent security flaws and mitigate their impacts when they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasm executes within a sandboxed stack-based environment, relying upon explicit imports to allow communication with the host. Because of this, you cannot &lt;strong&gt;express&lt;/strong&gt; anything malicious in Wasm. You can only express manipulations of the virtual environment and use provided imports. This differs from bytecodes which have references to the computers or operating systems they expect to run on built right into the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasm also hosts a number of features which protect the user from buggy code, including protected call stacks and runtime type checking. &lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/docs/security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Security - WebAssembly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;More details on the security model of Wasm can be found on WebAssembly.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ecommerce, speed is a competitive advantage that merchants need to drive sales. If a feature we deliver to merchants doesn’t come with the right tradeoff of load times to customization value, then we may as well not deliver it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasm is designed to leverage common hardware capabilities that provide it near native performance on a wide variety of platforms. It’s used by a community of performance driven developers looking to optimize browser execution. As a result, Wasm and surrounding tooling was built, and continues to be built, with a performance focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flexible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A code execution service is only as useful as the developers using it are productive. This means providing first class development experiences in multiple languages they’re familiar with. As a bytecode format, Wasm is targeted by a number of different compilers. This allows us to support multiple languages for developer use without altering the underlying execution model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Driven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fundamental alignment in goals and design, which provides our “engineering reason” for using Wasm. But there’s more to it than that—it’s about the people as well as the technology. If nobody was working on the Wasm ecosystem, or even if it was just on life support in its current state, &lt;strong&gt;we wouldn’t use it&lt;/strong&gt;. WebAssembly is an energized community that’s constantly building new things and has a lot of potential left to reach. By becoming a part of that community, Shopify stands to gain significantly from that enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also contributing to that enthusiasm ourselves. We’re collecting user feedback, discussing feature gaps, and most importantly contributing to the open source tools we depend on. We think this is the start of a healthy reciprocal relationship between ourselves and the WebAssembly community, and we expect to expand these efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered WebAssembly and why we’re using it, let’s move onto how we’re executing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use an open source tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lucet&lt;/a&gt; (originally written by Fastly). As a company, Fastly provides a programmable edge cloud platform. They’re trying to bring execution of high-volume, short-lived, and untrusted modules closer to where they’re being requested. This is the same as the problem we’re trying to solve with our Partner code, so it’s a natural fit to be using the same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lucet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucet is both a runtime and a compiler for Wasm. Modules are represented in Wasm for the safety that representation provides. Recall that you can’t &lt;em&gt;express&lt;/em&gt; anything malicious in Wasm. Lucet takes advantage of this and uses a validation of the Wasm module as a security check. After the validation, the module is compiled to an executable artifact with near bare metal performance. It also supports ahead of time compilation, allowing us to have these artifacts ready to execute at runtime. Lucet containers boast an impressive startup time of &lt;em&gt;35 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;μs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. That’s because it’s a container that doesn’t need to do anything at all to start up.  If you want the full picture, Tyler McMullan, the CTO of Fastly, did a great talk which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdWaQOgvd-g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lucet: Safe WebAssembly Outside the Browser by Tyler McMullen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;gives an overview of Lucet and how it works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A flow diagram showing how Shopify uses our Wasm engine: Lucet wrapped within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt; A flow diagram showing Shopify's Wasm engine
&lt;p&gt;We wrap Lucet within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules, which we call the Wasm Engine. This engine is called by Shopify during a runtime process, usually a web request, in order to satisfy some function. It then applies the output in context of the callsite. This application could involve the creation of a discount, the enforcement of a constraint, or any form of synchronous behaviour Merchants want to customize within the Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Execution Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some metrics pulled from a recent performance test. During this test, 100k modules were executed per minute for approximately 5 min. These modules contained a trivial implementation of enforcing a limit on the number of items purchased in a cart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A line graph showcasing the time taken to execute a module. The x axis representing the time over the test was running and the y axis is the time represented in ms&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt; Time taken to execute a module
&lt;p&gt;This chart demonstrates a breakdown of the time taken to execute a module, including I/O with the container and the execution of the module. The y-axis is time in ms, the x-axis is the time over which the test was running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light purple bar shows the time taken to execute the module in Lucet, the width of which hovers around 100 μs. The remaining bars deal with I/O and engine specifics, and the total time of execution is around 4 ms. All times are 99th percentiles (p99).To put these times in perspective, let’s compare these times to the request times of &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Storefront Renderer, our performant Online Store rendering service&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A line graph showing Storefront Renderer Response time&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt; Storefront Renderer response time
&lt;p&gt;This chart demonstrates the request time to Storefront Renderer over time. The y-axis is request time in seconds. The x-axis is the time over which the values were retrieved. The light blue line representing the 99th percentile hovers around 700 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if we consider the time taken by our module execution process to be generally under 5 ms, we can say that the performance impact of Lucet execution is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generating WebAssembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get value out of our high performance execution engine, we’ll need to empower developers to create compatible Wasm modules. Wasm is primarily intended as a compilation target, rather than something you write by hand (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Writing WebAssembly By Hand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;though you can write Wasm by hand&lt;/a&gt;). This leaves us with the question of what languages we’ll support and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically any language with a Wasm target can be supported, but the effort developers spend to conform to our API is better focused on solving problems for merchants. That’s why we’ve chosen to provide first class support to a single language that includes tools that get developers up and running quickly.At Shopify, our language of choice is Ruby. However, because Ruby is a dynamic language, we can’t compile it down to Wasm directly. We explored solutions involving compiling interpreters, but found that there was a steep performance penalty. Because of this, we decided to go with a statically compiled language and revisit the possibility of dynamic languages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our research we found that developers in our ecosystem were most familiar with Javascript. Unfortunately, Javascript was precluded as it’s a dynamic language like Ruby. Instead, we chose a language with familiar TypeScript-like syntax called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.assemblyscript.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;AssemblyScript&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;AssemblyScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using AssemblyScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, there are a huge number of languages that support a WebAssembly target. Unfortunately, there are two broad categories of WebAssembly compilers which we can’t use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compilers that generate environment or language specific artifacts, namely node or the browser. (Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tweag/asterius&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Asterius: A Haskell to WebAssembly compiler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blazor Build client web apps with C#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blazor&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compilers that are designed to work only with a particular Runtime. The modules generated by these compilers rely upon special language specific imports. This is often done to support a language’s standard library, which expects certain system calls or runtime features to be available. Since we don’t want to be locked down to a certain language or tool, we don’t use these compilers. (Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lumen/lumen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lumen - A new compiler and runtime for BEAM languages&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lumen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are powerful tools in the right conditions, but aren’t built for our use case. We need tools that produce WebAssembly, rather than tools which are &lt;em&gt;powered&lt;/em&gt; by WebAssembly. AssemblyScript is one such tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AssemblyScript, like many tools in the WebAssembly space, is still under development. It’s missing a few key features, such as closure support, and it still has a number of edge case bugs. This is where the importance of the community comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language and the tooling around AssemblyScript has an active community of enthusiasts and maintainers who have supported Shopify since we first started using the language in 2019. We’ve supported the community through &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/shopify&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Open Collective: Shopify&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;an OpenCollective donation&lt;/a&gt; and continuing code contributions. We’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/saulecabrera/asls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a language server&lt;/a&gt;, made some progress towards implementing closures, and have written bug fixes for the compiler and surrounding tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also integrated AssemblyScript into our own early stage tooling. We’ve built integrations into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Shopify App CLI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Shopify CLI&lt;/a&gt; which will allow developers to create, test, and deploy modules from their command line. To improve developer ergonomics, we provide SDKs which handle the low level implementation concerns of Shopify defined objects like “Money”. In addition to these tools, we’re building out systems which allow Partners to monitor their modules and receive alerts when their modules fail. The end goal is to give Partners the ability to move their code onto our service without losing any of the flexibility or observability they had on their own platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we tear down the boundaries between Partners and Merchants, we connect merchants with the entrepreneurs ready to solve their problems.

<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Boeing officials inappropriately coached test pilots in the MCAS simulator testing contrary to testing protocol,&quot; it said. &quot;It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 Max tragedies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
