<description>&lt;p&gt;The Web site for Fortune 500 real estate title insurance giant &lt;strong&gt;First American Financial Corp.&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FAF/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NYSE:FAF&lt;/a&gt;] leaked hundreds of millions of documents related to mortgage deals going back to 2003, until notified this week by KrebsOnSecurity. The digitized records — including bank account numbers and statements, mortgage and tax records, Social Security numbers, wire transaction receipts, and drivers license images — were available without authentication to anyone with a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_47830&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-47830&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/firstamericanfinancial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;First American Financial Corp. Image: Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Ana, Calif.-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_American_Corporation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;First American&lt;/a&gt; is a leading provider of title insurance and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industries. It employs some 18,000 people and brought in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/fortune500/first-american-financial/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more than $5.7 billion in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by a real estate developer in Washington state who said he’d had little luck getting a response from the company about what he found, which was that a portion of its Web site (firstam.com) was leaking tens if not hundreds of millions of records. He said anyone who knew the URL for a valid document at the Web site could view other documents just by modifying a single digit in the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this would potentially include anyone who’s ever been sent a document link via email by First American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity confirmed the real estate developer’s findings, which indicate that First American’s Web site exposed approximately 885 million files, the earliest dating back more than 16 years. No authentication was required to read the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exposed files are records of wire transactions with bank account numbers and other information from home or property buyers and sellers. &lt;strong&gt;Ben Shoval&lt;/strong&gt;, the developer who notified KrebsOnSecurity about the data exposure, said that’s because First American is one of the most widely-used companies for real estate title insurance and for closing real estate deals — where both parties to the sale meet in a room and sign stacks of legal documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Closing agencies are supposed to be the only neutral party that doesn’t represent someone else’s interest, and you’re required to have title insurance if you have any kind of mortgage,” Shoval said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The title insurance agency collects all kinds of documents from both the buyer and seller, including Social Security numbers, drivers licenses, account statements, and even internal corporate documents if you’re a small business. &lt;span class=&quot;pullquote pqright&quot;&gt;You give them all kinds of private information and you expect that to stay private.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoval shared a document link he’d been given by First American from a recent transaction, which referenced a record number that was nine digits long and dated April 2019. Modifying the document number in his link by numbers in either direction yielded other peoples’ records before or after the same date and time, indicating the document numbers may have been issued sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest document number available on the site – 000000075 — referenced a real estate transaction from 2003. From there, the dates on the documents get closer to real time with each forward increment in the record number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_47843&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sample-fa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-47843&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sample-fa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;478&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A redacted screenshot of one of many millions of sensitive records exposed by First American’s Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the morning of May 24, firstam.com was returning documents up to the present day (885,000,000+), including many PDFs and post-dated forms for upcoming real estate closings. By 2 p.m. ET Friday, the company had disabled the site that served the records. It’s not yet clear how long the site remained in its promiscuous state, but archive.org shows documents available from the site dating back to at least March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First American wouldn’t comment on the overall number of records potentially exposed via their site, or how long those records were publicly available. But a spokesperson for the company did share the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First American has learned of a design defect in an application that made possible unauthorized access to customer data.  At First American, security, privacy and confidentiality are of the highest priority and we are committed to protecting our customers’ information. The company took immediate action to address the situation and shut down external access to the application. We are currently evaluating what effect, if any, this had on the security of customer information. We will have no further comment until our internal review is completed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should emphasize that these documents were merely available from First American’s Web site; I do not have any information on whether this fact was known to fraudsters previously, nor do I have any information to suggest the documents were somehow mass-harvested (although a low-and-slow or distributed indexing of this data would not have been difficult for even a novice attacker).&lt;span id=&quot;more-47813&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the information exposed by First American would be a virtual gold mine for phishers and scammers involved in so-called Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, which often impersonate real estate agents, closing agencies, title and escrow firms in a bid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/blind-trust-in-email-could-cost-you-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;trick property buyers into wiring funds to fraudsters&lt;/a&gt;. According to the FBI, BEC scams are the most costly form of cybercrime today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with a single link to a First American document, BEC scammers would have an endless supply of very convincing phishing templates to use. A database like this also would give fraudsters a constant feed of new information about upcoming real estate financial transactions — &lt;em&gt;including the email addresses, names and phone numbers of the closing agents and buyers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in past stories here, these types of data exposures are some of the most common yet preventable. In December 2018, the parent company of &lt;strong&gt;Kay Jewelers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Jewelers&lt;/strong&gt; fixed a weakness in their site that &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/12/jared-kay-jewelers-parent-fixes-data-leak/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;exposed the order information for all of their online customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2018, financial industry giant &lt;strong&gt;Fiserv Inc.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/fiserv-flaw-exposed-customer-data-at-hundreds-of-banks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fixed a bug reported by KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/a&gt; that exposed personal and financial details of countless customers across hundreds of bank Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2018, identity theft protection service &lt;strong&gt;LifeLock&lt;/strong&gt; corrected an information disclosure flaw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/lifelock-bug-exposed-millions-of-customer-email-addresses/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;exposed the email address of millions of subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. And in April 2018, PaneraBread.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/panerabread-com-leaks-millions-of-customer-records/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;remedied a weakness&lt;/a&gt; exposing millions of customer names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and partial credit card numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>OKRs from a development team’s perspective</title>

Although this system was invented in the 70s, it has more recently become popular at Google and has spread through the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple system where the company defines a number of Objectives, and each objective has one or more measurable Key Results. Those KRs are intended to track progress on that objective over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Objective – Increase Customer Retention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Result #1 – Lifetime Customer value increase from $N to $N+5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Result #2 – Decrease Customer Churn Rate by 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies I’ve been at usually have 3-5 OKRs active at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What OKRs are supposed to do for a company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is basically that everyone has some very clear, direct and measurable goals to align behind. Everything a team does should align to a specific OKR. In theory, that means everyone is rowing in the same direction(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works great at certain levels and in certain ways. For the leadership team, it typically seems to be an excellent mechanism. It can put all the leaders on the same page(s) and provide a great starting point for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When it comes time for a dev team make decisions…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where OKRs become less useful is within the decision making process for an individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where OKRs become less useful is within the decision making process for an individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Joe Cannatti&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common pattern I’ve seen goes like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The team comes in with a backlog of things that they want to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They discuss each item and work out a basic list ordered by priority. The cut out things they know they aren’t going to get to any time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They go over the list and add a label to each task/project to specify the OKR to which it is most closely related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, it’s usually works out to be possible to assign an OKR to anything without too much mental gymnastics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wait a minute… Isn’t that backwards?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t we be using the OKRs to drive coming up with ideas in the first place instead of just wedging them in afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that’s the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backlog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually seems to me that the reason it works out this way is because teams generally have large backlogs of things they’ve decided they’d like to do. Most of the stuff in that backlog was written down long before the current OKRs where specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it makes sense that when the OKRs come out for the quarter, we just take what we already have and figure out how to fit it into the OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything wrong with that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem seems to me to be that the team doesn’t end up feeling truly connected or committed to the OKRs. For example, as I write this, I can tell you every project we are going to attempt to work on this quarter, but I can’t even tell you what the OKRs for the quarter are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did make them all fit in with OKRs, but it never felt like it was really what was driving us. Maybe that’s okay, but it doesn’t seem super useful to me. I think it gives leadership the justification they need to declare that everyone is working towards the same goals, but I don’t think it leads to dev teams actually feeling like that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ideas to improve how this all works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple ideas about how you can make this better for the next planning cycle for your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backlog Bankruptcy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start the planning for your next cycle, consider abandoning your current backlog. Instead of diving into the things your team has already defined as work that should be done, start totally from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive downward from the OKRs and see if the team can come with ideas that have not already been thought of. Or if they can reframe their existing ideas in meaningful ways to make them truly feel like an extension of the OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t easy to do. You will need to continually push people away from stuff that’s already in the backlog, but I think it can lead to better results in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Use OKRs to drive weekly team meetings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the OKRs as the starting point for your weekly sprint plannings and other checkin meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, these meetings will naturally follow a pattern of being shaped by the projects and tasks people are working on, but it’s possible to keep pushing the flow of the conversation back to the OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What effect would this have on your team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear how you think this could workout on your team. What do you expect would be different if you adopted these techniques? Comment below or reach me at joe@zafulabs.com&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Murray Gell-Mann Has Died</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/obituaries/murray-gell-mann-died-.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/obituaries/murray-gell-mann-died-.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Murray Gell-Mann, who transformed physics with his preternatural ability to find hidden patterns among the tiny particles that make up the universe, earning a Nobel Prize, died on Friday at his home in Santa Fe. He was 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jenna Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Santa Fe Institute, where he held the title of distinguished fellow, announced his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Much as atoms can be slotted into the rows and columns of the periodic table of the elements, Dr. Gell-Mann found a way, in 1961, to classify their smaller pieces — subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and mesons, which were being discovered by the dozen in cosmic rays and particle accelerator blasts. Arranged according to their properties, the particles clustered in groups of eight and 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a moment of whimsy, Dr. Gell-Mann, who hadn’t a mystical bone in his body, named his system the Eightfold Way after the Buddha’s eight-step path to enlightenment. He groaned ever after when people mistakenly inferred that particle physics was somehow related to Eastern philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Looking deeper, Dr. Gell-Mann realized that the patterns of the Eightfold Way could be further divided into triplets of even smaller components. He decided to call them quarks after a line from James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake”: “Three quarks for Muster Mark.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With Dr. Gell-Mann at the forefront, physics took on a Joycean feel. Before long there were up quarks and down quarks, strange quarks and charm quarks, top quarks and bottom quarks, all stuck together with particles called gluons. The funny nomenclature was as much a Gell-Mann inspiration as the mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Murray Gell-Mann dominated theoretical particle physics during the 1950s and ′60s, a period with an abundance of new experimental discoveries,” his colleague David J. Gross, another Nobel laureate in physics, said in an interview for this obituary in 2010. “With almost magical intuition Gell-Mann discerned the patterns and symmetries connecting the many new particles that were found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Dr. Gell-Mann at the California Institute of Technology in an undated photo.

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Conversant in several languages and fascinated by archaeology, linguistics, natural history and ornithology, Dr. Gell-Mann spotted and named subatomic phenomena as eagerly as if they were exotic birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Our work is a delightful game,” he said at the Nobel banquet in Stockholm, where he received the prize for physics in 1969. “I am frequently astonished that it so often results in correct predictions of experimental results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After comparing the simple structure of a mathematical formula to the rules of the sonnet, he surprised his hosts by finishing his speech in Swedish. (He later berated himself for mispronouncing a word.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With his hyphenated surname and cosmopolitan ways, Dr. Gell-Mann liked to keep people wondering about his pedigree. The physicist Sheldon Glashow once recalled a party at which his colleague cagily spun a tale about the confluence in Scotland of the River Gell and the River Mann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Gell-Mann also had a compulsion, upon meeting new people, to provide them with the etymology and proper pronunciation of their names, going on to expound on seemingly any subject under the sun. Some found him charming, others exasperating. No one doubted the immensity of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was born on Sept. 15, 1929, in Lower Manhattan to Arthur and Pauline (Reichstein) Gell-Mann, both Eastern European immigrants. At the time, his father operated a language school. (Born Isidore Gellmann in a small town in what was then Galicia, near the Russian border, the elder Mr. Gell-Mann had studied mathematics and philosophy in Vienna. He changed his name to Arthur and apparently added the hyphen sometime after 1911, when he was called to New York by his parents, who had emigrated earlier and were having financial problems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the Depression, the language school failed and the family, which included an older son, Ben, moved to cheaper quarters on 188th Street in the Bronx, near the Bronx Zoo, and later to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This was long before the time when an apartment in the neighborhood conferred a prestigious address. In an oral history interview, Dr. Gell-Mann recalled living in hard times. His father, he said, though intellectually curious, struggled to make a living, finding a back-office job on Wall Street, working for a toy importer and, finally, securing a position at a bank “at a very low salary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Dr. Gell-Mann, second from left, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969. At ceremonies in Stockholm, he posed with other prize winners: from left, Max Delbruck (United States, medicine), Derek R. Barton (England, chemistry), Odd Hassel (Norway, chemistry), Alfred D. Hershey (U.S., medicine), Salvador E. Luria (U.S., medicine) and Jan Tinbergen (Netherlands, economics).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We had very little money,” Dr. Gell-Mann said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Young Murray was already showing signs of precociousness, multiplying large numbers in his head and correcting his elders on the pronunciation of foreign words. With the encouragement of his mother and help from a piano teacher who gave lessons at a local settlement house, he won a scholarship to Columbia Grammar, a private school on West 93rd Street, where he earned the nickname “the Walking Encyclopedia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Graduating as valedictorian at age 14, he went to Yale, also on scholarship. But physics was not his first choice as a major area of study, he said in the oral history. He considered archaeology or a field related to natural history. His father, however, pushed him to choose engineering, saying it would lead to a well-paying job. Murray resisted, and they settled on physics as a compromise — “to please the old man,” Dr. Gell-Mann said — and he soon found that the subject fascinated him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“My father was absolutely right,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After Dr. Gell-Mann earned his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1951, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the Manhattan Project, brought him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. From there he went to the University of Chicago and worked under Enrico Fermi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The two decades after World War II were a golden age in physics, with experimenters discovering one new phenomenon after another for theorists to explain. Some particles bombarding the earth as cosmic rays seemed to defy the known laws of physics: They did not disintegrate nearly as quickly as the equations predicted. Dr. Gell-Mann showed that this behavior could be explained by positing a new physical quality that he named “strangeness.” Like energy, strangeness must always be conserved. Once this new rule was taken into account, physicists could explain the particle’s surprisingly slow decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1955 Dr. Gell-Mann married J. Margaret Dow, an archaeology assistant he had met during a visit back to Princeton. Lured by an offer from the California Institute of Technology, the couple moved to Pasadena, where they raised two children, Elizabeth and Nicholas. The renowned physicist Richard Feynman was also at Caltech, and the two men, their egos clashing, collaborated for a while before Dr. Gell-Mann struck out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As with strangeness, the Eightfold Way and quarks were independently discovered by other theorists, but the breadth of Dr. Gell-Mann’s accomplishments and his flare for nomenclature ensured that his would be the name most remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His instincts weren’t infallible. At first he dismissed quarks as mathematical abstractions — an accounting device with no real correlate in the physical world. There was good reason for his skepticism: Quarks would have to have electrical charges measured in thirds, something that was never observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After quarks were confirmed indirectly in an experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, in Menlo Park, Calif., Dr. Gell-Mann denied that he had ever doubted their existence. He went on to help explain how the tiny particles are permanently stuck together, keeping their fractional charges hidden from view. A “green” quark, a “red” quark and a “blue” quark (the labels were arbitrary) blended to form a “colorless” proton. It was Dr. Gell-Mann who named the theory quantum chromodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Dr. Gell-Mann at the Santa Fe Institute in 2003. He originally wanted to study archaeology or one of the natural sciences, he said,but chose physics “to please the old man.” He added, “My father was absolutely right.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jane Bernard/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By this time he was becoming known for his abrasive style, cutting down colleagues with withering remarks or saddling some of them with derisive names. The physicist &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/nyregion/dr-abraham-pais-82-physicist-and-science-historian-dies.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;Times obituary &quot;&gt;Abraham Pais&lt;/a&gt; became “the evil dwarf.” The renowned experimenter &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/science/leon-lederman-died-particle-accelerators.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;Times obituary &quot;&gt;Leon Lederman&lt;/a&gt; (who died last October) was “the plumber.” But those who could abide Dr. Gell-Mann’s prickliness found the intellectual pugilism exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“To work with him it helps first of all not to have too fragile an ego,” &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~hartle/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James Hartle&lt;/a&gt;, a former student and collaborator, said in a remembrance in 2014, when Dr. Gell-Mann received the prestigious Helmholtz Medal, established in 1892. (Past recipients included Lord Kelvin and Robert Bunsen.) “But despite the obvious differences in intellect and insight, Murray somehow makes you feel an equal partner when you are working with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Gell-Mann was an early champion of superstrings, hypothetical particles that, if ever verified, would be even more fundamental than quarks. Later in his career he began thinking in other directions, puzzling over the way simple laws of physics give rise to the beauty and intricacy of the living world. He explored the idea in a popular book, “The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex” (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1992, a little more than a decade after his wife, Margaret, died of cancer, he married Marcia Southwick, a poet he had met in Aspen, Colo., where he had a summer home. After retiring from Caltech and being named a fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, he moved with her to New Mexico. The marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his two children and by a stepson, Nicholas Southwick Levis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the time Dr. Gell-Mann learned he would receive the Helmholtz Medal from the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, he was in a wheelchair accompanied by an attendant. So the academy came to him, bestowing the prize in a ceremony at the Santa Fe Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Afterward, Dr. Gell-Mann’s friend, the novelist Cormac McCarthy, raised a champagne toast. During the ceremony, Dr. Gell-Mann had been described as “one of the great physicists of the latter half of the 20th century.” Mr. McCarthy objected to the qualification. Dr. Gell-Mann, he said, is “undoubtedly one of &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; great scientists of the 20th century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a talk in 2007, Dr. Gell-Mann compared the last century of physics to pulling back the skins of an onion, finding at every layer that the same mathematics applies — and hinting that an objective reality can conceivably be explained someday by a universal set of laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Somewhere on some other planet orbiting some very distant star, maybe in another galaxy, there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,” he said. “Suppose they have very different sensory apparatus — they have seven tentacles, and they have 14 funny-looking little compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel.” Nevertheless, Dr. Gell-Mann said, we can be confident that these creatures would discover the same fundamental laws. Some people believe otherwise, he added, “and I think that is utter baloney.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Maker of US border&amp;#039;s license-plate scanning tech ransacked by hacker</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/23/perceptics_hacked_license_plate_recognition/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/23/perceptics_hacked_license_plate_recognition/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Exclusive&lt;/strong&gt; The maker of vehicle license plate readers used extensively by the US government and cities to identify and track citizens and immigrants has been hacked. Its internal files were pilfered, and are presently being offered for free on the dark web to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee-based Perceptics prides itself as &quot;the sole provider of stationary LPRs [license plate readers] installed at all land border crossing lanes for POV [privately owned vehicle] traffic in the United States, Canada, and for the most critical lanes in Mexico.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Perceptics recently announced, in a pact with Unisys Federal Systems, it had landed &quot;a key contract by US Customs and Border Protection to replace existing LPR technology, and to install Perceptics next generation License Plate Readers (LPRs) at 43 US Border Patrol check point lanes in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday this week, however, an individual using the pseudonym &quot;Boris Bullet-Dodger&quot; contacted &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt;, alerting us to the hack, and provided a list of files exfiltrated from Perceptics' corporate network as proof. We're assuming this is the same &quot;Boris&quot; involved in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/30/citycomp_hacked/&quot;&gt;CityComp hack&lt;/a&gt; last month. Boris declined to answer our questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage width_85&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/05/23/screenshot_perceptics_files.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/05/23/screenshot_perceptics_files.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Perceptics files&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of Perceptics files&quot; height=&quot;609&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_center&quot;&gt;Archives of files stolen from Perceptics touted on the dark web this week ... Click to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file names and accompanying directories – numbering almost 65,000 – fit with the focus of the surveillance technology biz. They include .xlsx files named for locations and zip codes, .jpg files with names that refer to &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;scene,&quot; .docx files associated with presumed government clients like ICE, and date-and-time stamped .jpgs and .mp4 files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there many other types of files: .htm, .html, .txt, .doc, .asp, .tdb, .mdb, .json, .rtf, .xls, and .tif among others. Many of the image files, we're guessing, are license plate captures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files also include .mp3 files, presumably from someone's desktop or laptop PC. Among the songs: Superstition, by Stevie Wonder, and Wannabe by Spice Girls, and a variety of AC/DC and Cat Stevens songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/01/26/ransomnote.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;A Ransom Note&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;'Many companies pay us for our work, and we do not publish data and help them to eliminate vulnerabilities'&quot;&gt;Extortionist hacks IT provider used by the stars of tech and big biz, leaks customer info after ransom goes unpaid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/30/citycomp_hacked/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stolen files amount to hundreds of gigabytes and include Microsoft Exchange and Access databases, ERP databases, HR records, Microsoft SQL Server data stores, and so on. This information, which includes business plans, financial figures, and personal information, is presently available in multiple .rar files on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of the company's business – border security data acquisition, commercial vehicle inspection, electronic toll collection and roadway monitoring – means that it's likely to have a significant amount of sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Perceptics, reached by phone, confirmed that the company was aware that its network had been compromised. She said the biz is working with authorities to investigate, but declined to go into further detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the CityComp hack, stolen files were released because a ransom was not paid; we have yet to determine whether a ransom was sought for the Perceptics files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the company's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.perceptics.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; redirected to Google.com. As we were about to publish this piece, however, we noticed the site was once again functioning properly. It's likely to take longer still for the business to recover from this cyber-break-in. ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making a Game Boy Game in 2017</title>

<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has childhood dreams. Mine was to make a game for my first console: the Nintendo Game Boy. Today, I fulfilled this dream, by &lt;strong&gt;releasing my first Game Boy game on a actual cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll present the tools I used, and some pitfalls a newcomer like me had to overcome to make this project a reality! Due to it's length, this article will be split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Sheep It Up!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is an arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging: how high can you climb without falling down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sheep It Up! gameplay&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a game collector myself, I wanted this game to be produced without sacrificing any vintage Game Boy titles. So everything is manufactured specifically for this game: the pcb, the rom, the shell, the protective case and even the sticker! We also tried to keep the price reasonable, so everyone can enjoy the game: &lt;strong&gt;$15 (+shipping)&lt;/strong&gt;. It will run on any Game Boy model, from the first one to the GBA SP, including the Super Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still own a Game Boy, you can buy a cartridge on the publisher website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the 90's, creating game for a 8-bit game console was a real challenge, and required a team of highly trained professionals. Designers, artists and developers from this era are real heroes to me: to be able to produce such wonderful games with the limited tools they had compared the ones we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, it's still a lot of work to make a game for a 8-bit console. But, thanks to the wonderful homebrew communities, we now have a lot of tools to make our life easier! Without them, an hobbyist like me could never be able create a Game Boy game on his own. So, what are those tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starter, the programming language. Back in the day, all dedicated gaming hardware was programmed in Assembly. It's still possible (and even recommended) to use Assembly today. But it's no longer the only option, as many devkits for 8-bits and 16-bits consoles are based on the C programming language. For the Game Boy, this awesome tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Developers Kit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBDK).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to make art and level design, you no longer need to use graph paper and a hand scanner. Hopefully, you can now use two complementary piece of software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Designer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBTD)&lt;/em&gt;. It will allow you draw sprites and tiles, and to export them in a binary format that can be read by a Game Boy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Map Builder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBMB). &lt;/em&gt; This one will let you build level and background image using the tiles drawn with GBTD &lt;em&gt;(it's kind of like Tiled, but for Game Boy)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we also need a way to test our game. This is where modernity is key. While in the 90's developers had to use expensive ICE boxes, today we have powerful software emulators that can run on any computer. To test your own game, the best choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgb.bircd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BGB&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very accurate Game Boy emulator that comes with a powerful debugger, the one tool you'll need to create a working game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/bgb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is in top-right corner, all the other scary windows are the various debugger tools!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be really sure your game is working, you will also need to test it on real hardware. In the 90's, people were burning their program on a EPROM chip, and used some special cartridges to plug this chip into an actual Game Boy. While efficient, it was quite a lengthy and expensive process. Today, we have what are called &quot;Flashcarts&quot;: cartridges where you can plug a SD card with your game ROM to play it on an actual Game Boy. The idea is the same, but the tools are more easily accessible and faster to use. Several Game Boy Flashcarts exists, but the best one is arguably the one built by Krikzz: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://krikzz.com/store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Everdrive Game Boy.&lt;/a&gt; A newer and improved model was released this summer, but I used the old version that I bought some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gb_eprom3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/everdrive-gb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flashcart from the 90's vs one from the 2010's&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these great tools available in 2017, making a game today for a 1989 game console is still a challenge. Especially for people who have been trained to use &quot;modern tools&quot;, such as Unity, Unreal Engine or Godot. Here are the main challenges I faced during the development of &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;, including the things that surprised me about how a Game Boy is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Size limitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the obvious one: &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt; is a rather simple game. One factor that explains this fact is that the whole game weights &lt;strong&gt;only 32KB&lt;/strong&gt;. Yup, the code, the images, and even the sounds are all fitting in a tiny 32KB space. To give you a point of comparison, 32KB is the size of the Wikipedia logo in a very tiny resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                     &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/LogoWikipedia32k.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           Full Game: 32KB                            160x146px (PNG-24): 32KB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every Game Boy game fits in 32KB. For me, it was a technical limitation to be able to release the game on an actual cartridge &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20180213/314554/&quot;&gt;more details in part 2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. The best and most famous Game Boy titles are actually way larger than that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Red / Blue&lt;/strong&gt; are 1024KB (so huge!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wario Land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zelda Link's Awakening&lt;/strong&gt; are 512KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby Dream Land&lt;/strong&gt; is 256KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gargoyle's Quest&lt;/strong&gt; is 128KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, few Game Boy titles are only 32KB. Most of them are from the early life of the console. For example, both &lt;strong&gt;Alleyway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(one of the Game Boy launch title in Japan)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tetris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(launch title in US and Europe)&lt;/em&gt; are 32KB games. These are both excellent titles, but due to their tiny cartridge space, they are also somewhat &quot;limited&quot; in scope: &lt;em&gt;single screen, few different graphical and audio assets, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/game-boy-alleyway.jpg&quot;/&gt;       &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/Tetris.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleyway and Tetris are 32KB games, like Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CPU: playing with Portable Power!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Boy is powered by a &lt;strong&gt;4MHz CPU&lt;/strong&gt;, custom built for the console &lt;em&gt;(it's a mix between Zilog's Z80 and Intel's 8080 processors)&lt;/em&gt;. All in all, Gameboy processing power is comparable to a NES, and even a bit more powerful due the reduced screen size and colors to display &lt;em&gt;(more on that latter)&lt;/em&gt;. Despite a mere 4Mhz speed, all the Game Boy games are displayed in &lt;strong&gt;constant 60fps&lt;/strong&gt;. Take that PS4 Pro and Xbox One X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for a programmer fresh out of college, the biggest constraints will be that it's a 8-bits processor. As you may know, internally all the computers are using 0 and 1 to process data. A single digit, which can have either 0 or 1 as value, is called a &quot;bit&quot; &lt;em&gt;(short for &quot;binary digit&quot;, as it can only have two different values)&lt;/em&gt;. A processor is defined as &quot;8-bits&quot; if it can process 8 bits of data in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it affect the making of video games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the less &quot;bits&quot; the CPU can process, the more limited will your gameplay variables be. For example, in games we use a lot of integers numbers to represent values: life, speed, score, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 8 bits of data, an integer can store smaller numbers than a 16 bits variable :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-128 to 127&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 255 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-32768 to 32767&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 65535 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's still obscure for you, let's take a concrete example from &lt;em&gt;Sheet It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_score.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this picture, the score variable has 5 digits, and can range from 0 to 99999. Sadly, it's way larger than what a 8 bits integer variable can store. I mean, even a 16 bits integer variable isn't enough to hold such a &quot;large&quot; score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to be able to track score in Sheep It Up!, I had to use not one, but five different 8 bits integer variables to store the player score. I let you guess how &quot;fun&quot; it was to handle all these variables, especially when I added the ability to keep a high score, thus I had to compare two values stored across 5 different variables. Programming on a 8 bits system will force you to come up with complex solutions like that all the time, while modern systems will simply use 32 bits or 64 bits variables and never pose such a problem to their programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(N.B. for experienced game developers: I know that I could have been more efficient than using a whole int8 to store a single digit ranging from 0 to 9. But I actually needed each variable to be able to go from 0 to 255, as in reality I don't store the score digit directly, but the tile id used to display this number on the screen)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;One world, two planes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any image displayed on the Game Boy is composed of two elements: a background layer (BKG) and several moving objects, also called sprites (OBJ). You are limited to a maximum on 40 sprites onscreen, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_planes.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              Background (BKG)                                      Sprites (OBJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it's a bit more complex than that, as there is an additional &quot;window&quot; layer than can scroll differently from the background. It's usually used to make the user interface (score, etc.).  But this layer is &quot;non-transparent&quot;: it will hide any graphical data on the background layer behind it. So, for the sake of simplicity, you can consider that you have a single &quot;background&quot; layer on a Game Boy, but that you can make part of it scrolling independently if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Boy sees 4 colors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the elephant in the room: the original Game Boy model can only display 4 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_colors(1).png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that it's not really Light Grey and Dark Grey, but rather Light Green and Dark Green, but that's not the point: you can only use 4 colors to draw our art. At least, as long as you are drawing the background, because the case is different with sprites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as you can see in this picture, the Sheep is drawn with 3 colors only. Why is that? Actually, I drew the sprite with 4 colors. But the 4th color, here &quot;Black&quot;, is simply not displayed because it's used as &quot;transparent color&quot; by the Game Boy. That way, the sprites are not all &quot;square images&quot;, but they can be a wide variety of shapes allowing to see the background image behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it mean that I cannot use black to draw sprites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not, as you can see below with the &quot;velcro&quot; strap sprite. For this sprite, I actually used a different palette of 3+1 colors: &quot;White&quot; is used as transparent color, and &quot;Black&quot; is displayed on the sprite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun with palettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being limited to 4 colors only, the Game Boy actually uses 3 different palettes to display images, and that's very cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_palettes.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there is a single &quot;4 colors&quot; palette for the background layer, and two &quot;3 colors + 1 transparent color&quot; palettes that the sprites can use &lt;em&gt;(each sprite can use one palette or the other)&lt;/em&gt;. The cool thing about these palettes is that you can freely assign any color you want to any palette slot. This allow you to make some nice effects, such as the fade-in / fade-out seen in many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_fade_anim2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a fade-in on a Game Boy, you simply need modify the colors on the 3 palettes. In the first step, all the palette slots are filled with white color. Then, in Step 2, the darkest color slot (black) is filled with light gray, to progressively reveal the image. In Step 3, Light Gray becomes Dark Gray, and so on, until the 4 colors are displayed on each palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a similar method, we can also make a character &quot;blink&quot;, by switching the colors on its palette every frame. For example, this method is used when Mario catch a star and become invincible in Super Mario Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiling the world!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last oddity in the way a Game Boy display images, at least for a game developer trained on current-gen engines. As the console doesn't have a &quot;frame buffer&quot;, you can't specify the color of each pixel on screen individually. Indeed, all the on-screen images are built by assembling loads of &quot;tiles&quot;, i.e. 8x8 pixels squares. This is applicable for both background and sprites :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique, designed to reduce the amount of video RAM needed to display images, implies that you can't draw freehand lines on the Game Boy screen. But it's also one of the secret that makes the Game Boy able to display such beautiful games with a mere 4Mhz CPU and only 8KB of video RAM &lt;em&gt;(yes, I wrote kilobytes and not megabytes or gigabytes).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the drawback of this tile-based display is that our &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;velcro&quot; sprites are actually made of more than one sprite. The Sheep is 16x16 pixels, so in theory it would need four 8x8 sprites to be displayed. Hopefully the Game Boy also have a 8x16 display mode for the sprites, meaning that in reality each object in Sheep It Up! is only made of two sprites, and not four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that we are &lt;strong&gt;limited to 40 sprites onscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy &lt;strong&gt;can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it means that we can't have more 5 sheep side by side on the same line, instead of 10 as you might have thought at first &lt;em&gt;(because the sheep is made of 2 sprites from an hardware point of view)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full-screen tiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention it yet, but the Game Boy screen resolution is 160x144 pixels. It means that you need 20x18 = &lt;strong&gt;360 tiles&lt;/strong&gt; to cover the whole screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Game Boy VRAM is limited &lt;em&gt;(8KB)&lt;/em&gt;, and it can store only &lt;strong&gt;256 different tiles&lt;/strong&gt;. It means that, without any coding trick, you can't display a fullscreen image :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is to reuse tiles, as you can see, the tile image have a lot of &quot;empty space&quot;, meaning that a single &quot;white tile&quot; in RAM is placed several times on the image. In reality, the title screen image only uses 178 different tiles, meaning I still had room for some extra details if I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_rawtitletiles.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what method they followed to re-use tiles in the 90's, but today we have a very nice tool for that, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisantonellis.com/gameboy/gbtdg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Data Generator&lt;/a&gt;. You feed it with a PNG image &lt;em&gt;(in 4 colors)&lt;/em&gt; and it will automatically generate you the tiles and the tilemap needed to display it on an actual Game Boy. Obviously, it will also automatically detect and reuse identical tiles to save as much video RAM as possible on the console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtdg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information, most of the 80s and 90's consoles work in a similar way, with 8x8 tiles-based display: &lt;em&gt;Nes, Master System, PC-Engine, Super Nintendo, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear...&lt;/em&gt; The first mainstream home consoles to have a frame buffer were the PlayStation and Saturn, and the first Nintendo handled to do it was the Game Boy Advance &lt;em&gt;(The Atari Lynx being the first handheld with individually addressable pixels)&lt;/em&gt;. So learning to &quot;work with tiles&quot; on the Game Boy is actually a &lt;strong&gt;transferable skill&lt;/strong&gt; if you later work on another retro game console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips from the pros: making 4 colors sprites!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's end with a little tip coming from the talented developers at Nintendo. Please look at this screenshot from Wario Land :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how the coin, a sprite, is actually drawn with 4 colors? How did they perform such a feat, when I just told you that the Game Boy can only display 3 colors per sprite ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple : each coin is made of 2 sprites, and each sprite uses a different object palette. As you can see, when we split the coin in two halves, it's indeed made of two 8x16 sprites. As always with Nintendo, there is a great attention to detail: they didn't simply merged two &quot;sprites halves&quot;, but they draw them slightly tilted and they overlapped them by 1 pixels, so the coin feel more like a single element!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the first part of postmortem. Thanks for reading it this far! In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20180213/314554/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we'll discuss the audio challenges &lt;em&gt;(lot of oddities here too!)&lt;/em&gt;, and how the cartridges were built without destroying any previously existing Game Boy game. I'll also go over the feedback I received from players on &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_manyWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this article! And, if you still have a Game Boy laying around, don't forget that you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy a beautiful Sheep It Up cartridge for a mere $15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Catskull games. Each cartridge will be assembled by hand before being sent to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;blog-post__section&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Print edition | United States&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop=&quot;description&quot; readability=&quot;134&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HE SALESMEN&lt;/small&gt; and women at the International Association of Chiefs of Police technology conference last week were as enthusiastic as ever. This in-car tablet had a tougher coating and less intrusive bezel; that radar gun had a clearer display and a faster processor. But conference veterans noted the lack of truly ground-breaking gear. Attitudes to police technology are changing—not only among American civilians but among the cops themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently Americans seemed willing to let police deploy new technologies in the name of public safety as they saw fit. But crime is much rarer than it was in the 1990s, and technological scepticism is growing. On May 14th San Francisco became the first American city to ban its agencies from using facial-recognition systems. That decision was profoundly unpopular at the police conference. Jack Marks, who manages Panasonic’s public-safety products, called it “short-sighted and reactive”. The technology exists, he said; “the best thing you can do is help shape it.” Other cities, including Somerville in Massachusetts, may soon follow San Francisco’s lead all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are under scrutiny, too. On May 22nd Amazon saw off two challenges by activist shareholders. They wanted the board to commission an independent study to determine whether Rekognition, its facial-recognition platform, imperils civil, human and privacy rights. The activists also wanted to ban the firm from selling Rekognition to governments until the company’s board concludes, “after an evaluation using independent evidence”, that it does not erode those rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior police officers argue that the technology is a useful crime-fighting tool. Daniel Steeves, chief information officer for the Ottawa Police Service, says that a robbery-investigation unit spent six months testing a facial-recognition system. It lowered the average time required for an officer to identify a subject from an image from 30 days to three minutes. The officers could simply run an image through a database of 50,000 mugshot photos rather than leafing through them manually or sending a picture to the entire department and asking if anybody recognised the suspect. Other officers stress that a facial-recognition match never establishes guilt. It is just a lead to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet officers sense that the technology is in bad odour. A deputy police chief from an American suburb with a security system that uses facial recognition around the local high school says: “We knew that facial recognition wasn’t going to fly, so we called it an Early Warning Detection System.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many distinguish between the sort of facial-recognition software that Mr Steeves’s department used, which matches suspects to mugshots already in a police database, to the more widely feared version—used in China, for instance—that blankets cities with cameras that employ facial recognition and monitors citizens accused of no crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others think the distinction less clear-cut. Matt Cagle, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, fears that “facial recognition is vulnerable to mission-creep and growth”. Even a system like the one in Ottawa requires building a database that could be used for less ethical purposes. Testifying before Congress on May 22nd, Clare Garvie—a facial-recognition expert at Georgetown Law’s Centre on Privacy and Technology—argued that because facial recognition can subject people to persistent secret surveillance, it presents “a unique threat to our civil rights and liberties”. Ms Garvie’s research has found that, conservatively, half of all Americans have their faces in databases to which the police can get access. Often the image is a drivers’ licence photo. She also noted that the technology is bad at identifying non-white faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes scepticism about technology comes from the cops. Earlier this year the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported that many small police departments were abandoning body-worn-camera programmes because of the cost. Although the cameras are cheap, officers can generate 15 gigabytes of video per shift; storage costs mount. Police unions often oppose body-worn cameras, fearing they imperil their members by giving superior officers licence to search them for punishable behaviour. Other officers complain about the amount of time required to review and redact footage in response to public-information requests. They also seem not to work. A study from George Mason University released in March found that body-worn cameras had no “statistically significant or consistent effects” on people’s views on police, or on police or civilian behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this means that policing will become less technologically sophisticated, however. Even as the public and the police turn against some visible technologies, other ones are quietly being deployed. The most important innovations are invisible to most citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police have long gathered immense amounts of data, but have not always organised them well. Police complain about the amount of time they spend doing paperwork; others lament how hard it is to get accurate data from police departments. Several firms fishing for business at the conference in Jacksonville offered tools designed to organise the huge amounts of information that police take in, rather than gadgets that generate more of it. Such tools are supposed to present officers with as much information as possible as soon as they need it, and make data taken from disparate sources easily accessible and searchable. They are also supposed to organise data in such a way that the cops can see where they need to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Fisher, executive director of strategic initiatives for the Seattle Police Department, recently oversaw the building of a data system linking previously siloed streams of information, such as emergency-call records, stops based on reasonable suspicion, and police use of force. This let the department know precisely where disparities occur. Before, says Mr Fisher, they often relied on guesswork and anecdotal evidence to fill in the blanks. “Now we can know: in how many of our dispatches did it end up that a person was in crisis, and in that subset, how often did we use force?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon, which makes body-worn cameras and Tasers (the police weapon that gave the firm its former name) is building a system for managing records. Jenner Holden, the firm’s chief information-security officer, says that “what we can do to help officers improve most isn’t the sexy stuff. It’s helping them be more efficient and spend more time on the street.” &lt;/p&gt;

However, to comply with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent order from the U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;, Google pulled the Chinese tech company and smartphone manufacturer Huawei’s license to use the proprietary Google software that sits on top of Android. In doing so, Google quietly exposed the powerful control it has over its supposedly open phone ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6804&quot; id=&quot;6804&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most Android manufacturers — including Huawei — are what’s known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google hardware partners&lt;/a&gt;. This relationship lets them build their phones around a collection of Google products, from apps like Google Maps and Assistant, to under-the-hood tools like location services or push notifications. While Google gives off the impression that Android is open and available to everyone, these services represent a quiet control that the company doesn’t often enforce over its hardware partners — though, as it has now proven, it certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d20b&quot; id=&quot;d20b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the recent order, the U.S. government forced Google’s hand. The U.S. Department of Commerce put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huawei on the “Entity List,”&lt;/a&gt; which blocks it from buying technology from U.S. companies without government approval. Huawei and Google now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have three months&lt;/a&gt; to send updates to existing users. For new phones, Huawei &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may be able to&lt;/a&gt; use the open-source version of Android, but it can’t be a Google partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;142e&quot; id=&quot;142e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The distinction between using Android and being a Google partner seems messy from the outside, but “Android” technically refers to the core operating system that covers basic things like making phone calls or using the camera. The freely available version of Android is called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and a company doesn’t have to be a partner to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;601c&quot; id=&quot;601c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most manufacturers like Huawei, however, do choose to become a Google partner. That means Huawei agrees to only make devices that use a collection of Google apps known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Mobile Services&lt;/a&gt; which includes things like Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play Store. Under this arrangement, Huawei can’t, for example, make a phone that ships with Microsoft’s Bing and Edge instead of Google Search and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;424f&quot; id=&quot;424f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1024&quot; id=&quot;1024&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Partners also have to meet certain security and compatibility conditions. In exchange, they get access to all of Google’s apps and infrastructure, making their phones much more appealing to customers worldwide than they would otherwise be. This arrangement is usually free, though manufacturers who sell in the EU &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pay a fee&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exempt from the all-or-nothing condition&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complicated legal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da87&quot; id=&quot;da87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to Bryan Pon, PhD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mobile platform researcher&lt;/a&gt; and co-founder of the data analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caribou Data&lt;/a&gt;, this gives Google a lot of control over its platform. “Consumers are attached to the Google products and services that sit on top of the operating system,” explains Pon. “Google has very strong proprietary control over those, and in that sense wields tremendous power, irrespective of the operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe56&quot; id=&quot;fe56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Additionally, Huawei, and Google’s other partners, have to include a collection of developer tools called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Play Services&lt;/a&gt;. These background tools let app developers easily do things like create push notifications, embed maps in their apps, or get a GPS location. Most Android apps distributed through the Google Play Store rely on some of these tools to provide features that are too expensive or difficult for every developer to build themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71f1&quot; id=&quot;71f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Pon explains, some of these tools are crucial features that would normally be part of an operating system. “They’re actually taking functionality out of the core platform,” Pon says. “They’re leaving Android open source, more and more, just a shell. And that core functionality is now part of just proprietary Google services.” Google does this to make it easier to update important features without waiting for a big Android update, but the result consolidates Google’s power over its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4efe&quot; id=&quot;4efe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Without Google Play Services, Huawei would have to build these tools itself or leave developers to do it. The company has created its own version of some of these features — like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;push notification service&lt;/a&gt; — but developers still have to add support for Huawei’s version of the tools to their apps in order for them to work on non-Google phones. Huawei is building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own app store alternative&lt;/a&gt;, but it could take a long time to build everything else that developers and users are accustomed to getting from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;733b&quot; id=&quot;733b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous. One of the few companies to opt out of Google’s system was Amazon with its series of Fire Tablets. If you buy a Fire, you’ll have something similar to an Android experience, but with hardly a trace of Google. Instead, you’ll use the Amazon Appstore. You’ll talk to Alexa instead of the Google Assistant. You’ll use Amazon’s Silk Browser instead of Chrome. Under the hood, all your apps will be using Amazon’s version of key features, like notifications or GPS. The approach works fine enough for a tablet, but when Amazon tried to make a phone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it failed miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d269&quot; id=&quot;d269&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Samsung tries to walk a middle ground, offering parallel versions of almost everything Google makes, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basic email apps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own voice assistant&lt;/a&gt;, without breaking away from its partner agreement. But if Samsung were to find itself in Huawei’s shoes, even that might not be enough. “I think to some extent, Samsung has to tell itself that it… has a plan B,” says Pon. “But I think, realistically, if they get turned off, like Huawei might get turned off, then they don’t have any good options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4438&quot; id=&quot;4438&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Under normal circumstances, this symbiotic relationship benefits everyone involved and lends credibility to Google’s claim that Android — unlike the iPhone — is “open,” while still letting the company maintain as much control over Android as possible. If a company like Amazon wants to build its own alternative from scratch, it can. For companies like Samsung and Huawei that can’t afford to or aren’t willing to go that far, they can leverage Google’s massive resources to make a variation of Android that consumers will want, without deviating too far from Google’s master plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c48&quot; id=&quot;4c48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, barring relief in the brewing China-U.S. trade war, Huawei has been forcibly pushed into going the much harder Amazon route. Huawei can’t use Google apps, it can’t support the push notifications or location services most apps use, and it even has to wait longer for security updates before it can push them to users. Existing users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;won’t be affected for now&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the temporary license granted by the U.S. Commerce Department, but future plans look grim. It took Amazon years to build its own version of Google’s services. Huawei’s CEO says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the company has a plan&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how long that plan could take to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9752&quot; id=&quot;9752&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, for Huawei, it’s not all bad news. The Google Play Store has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned in China for years&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the country’s Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; that censors many foreign sites and services including Google search, Facebook, or YouTube. Losing them is of little importance in the Chinese market, which makes up &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;52% of the company’s overall revenue&lt;/a&gt;. Outside China, on the other hand, Huawei stands to lose quite a lot. Globally, it’s hard to sell an Android phone without Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;32e2&quot; id=&quot;32e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb1c&quot; id=&quot;fb1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Beyond Huawei’s problems — and beyond the reality that geopolitics will play an increasing role in the tech business — this situation reveals a truth that Google has downplayed for years. While Android — the stripped down, open-source operating system — may be available to everyone, all of the Google pieces that make most Android phones worthwhile are locked behind a partner program. Google might let almost everyone into its exclusive club, but it reserves the right to kick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f2f9&quot; id=&quot;f2f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Even if we could assume the best about Google’s intentions to keep Android as open as possible — and Google did not respond to a request by &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; for comment — the Huawei order demonstrates that Google’s control can be abused by other entities. If the U.S. were in a trade war with South Korea instead of China, Samsung phones — still the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; in the world over — could face a similar fate. Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
