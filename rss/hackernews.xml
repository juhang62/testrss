<title>DoorDash confirms data breach affected 4.9M customers, workers and merchants</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;doordash&quot;&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food delivery company said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.doordash.com/important-security-notice-about-your-doordash-account-ddd90ddf5996#46h35gr24e&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that 4.9 million customers, delivery workers and merchants had their information stolen by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach happened on May 4, the company said, but added that customers who joined after April 5, 2018 are not affected by the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why it took almost five months for DoorDash to detect the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoorDash spokesperson Mattie Magdovitz blamed the breach on “a third-party service provider,” but the third-party was not named. “We immediately launched an investigation and outside security experts were engaged to assess what occurred,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who joined the platform before April 5, 2018 had their name, email and delivery addresses, order history, phone numbers and hashed and salted passwords stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said consumers had the last four digits of their payment cards taken, though full numbers and card verification values (CVV) were not taken. Both delivery workers and merchants had the last four digits of their bank account numbers stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 100,000 delivery workers also had their driver’s license information stolen in the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news comes almost exactly a year after DoorDash customers complained &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/doordash-customers-say-their-accounts-have-been-hacked/&quot;&gt;that their accounts had been hacked&lt;/a&gt;. The company at the time denied a data breach and claimed attackers were running credential stuffing attacks, in which hackers take lists of stolen usernames and passwords and try them on other sites that use the same passwords. But many of the customers we spoke to said their passwords were unique to DoorDash, ruling out such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked at the time, DoorDash could not explain how the affected accounts were breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with comments from the spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Apple Kills Indie Developers</title>
<link>https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/issues/695</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/issues/695</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over 2 year I am develop FSNotes app, over 1000 commits pushed. I write code almost every day and this is really hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSNotes available for free in &lt;strong&gt;brew&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;. I love this app. One motivation point for me was AppStore sales, and this is now ruined by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message written after 50 days awaiting approving my iOS app – FSNotes Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 days ago I received this message in AppStore Connect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug 6, 2019 at 6:45 AM&lt;br/&gt;From Apple&lt;br/&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are unable to continue this app’s review because your Apple Developer Program account is currently under investigation for not following the App Store Review Guidelines’ Developer Code of Conduct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our investigation, we will not review any apps you submit. Once we have completed our investigation, we will notify you via Resolution Center. Due to the nature of the investigation you will be ineligible to receive an expedited review until the investigation is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not require any additional information from you at this time, nor do we have any additional details to share. We appreciate your continued patience during our investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Store Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to appeal and got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand your concern regarding this investigation. However, your account is still under investigation and no action has been taken against it at this time. We are investigating your apps, account, and any related accounts to ensure compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines, Developer Code of Conduct, and Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have completed our investigation, we will notify you via Resolution Center of any next steps. Due to the nature of the investigation you will be ineligible to receive an expedited review until the investigation is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we require any additional information about your app or account, we will contact you. We appreciate your continued patience during our investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No any additional info. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter written by bot, and you can Google it by key words &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/116331&quot;&gt;https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/116331&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with locked apps awaiting response from Apple. App store team silent from 1 to 3 month, and then unlock (?) reviewing process without any explanations. All these people paid for membership 99 $ and get nothing in results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is OK, App Store Team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tried to connect via developers support page, and got same – nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Oleksandr,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that you do not agree with the way the investigation is being carried out. However, until the investigation in to your account is competed no apps under your account will be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that you would like information to share with your users regarding your app, but until the investigation is completed I will not have any updates or additional information to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your continued patience throughout the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's time to explain to the developers, what going on, Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share and repost this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Octopus: An Alien Among Us</title>
<link>https://lithub.com/the-octopus-an-alien-among-us/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lithub.com/the-octopus-an-alien-among-us/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Self-replicating, bacterial life first appeared on Earth about 4 billion years ago. For most of Earth’s history, life remained at the single-celled level, and nothing like a nervous system existed until around 600 or 700 million years ago (MYA). In the attention schema theory, consciousness depends on the nervous system processing information in a specific way. The key to the theory, and I suspect the key to any advanced intelligence, is attention—the ability of the brain to focus its limited resources on a restricted piece of the world at any one time in order to process it in greater depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will begin the story with sea sponges, because they help to bracket the evolution of the nervous system. They are the most primitive of all multicellular animals, with no overall body plan, no limbs, no muscles, and no need for nerves. They sit at the bottom of the ocean, filtering nutrients like a sieve. And yet sponges do share some genes with us, including at least 25 that, in people, help structure the nervous system. In sponges, the same genes may be involved in simpler aspects of how cells communicate with each other. Sponges seem to be poised right at the evolutionary threshold of the nervous system. They are thought to have shared a last common ancestor with us between about 700 and 600 MYA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, another ancient type of animal, the sea jelly, does have a nervous system. Sea jellies don’t fossilize very well, but by analyzing their genetic relationship to other animals, biologists estimate that they may have split from the rest of the animal kingdom as early as 650 MYA. These numbers may change with new data, but as a plausible, rough estimate, it seems that neurons, the basic cellular components of a nervous system, first appeared in the animal kingdom somewhere between sponges and sea jellies, a little more than half a billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neuron is, in essence, a cell that transmits a signal. A wave of electrochemical energy sweeps across the membrane of the cell from one end to the other, at about 200 feet per second, and influences another neuron, a muscle, or a gland. The earliest nervous systems may have been simple nets of neurons laced throughout the body, interconnecting the muscles. Hydras work on this nerve-net principle. They are tiny water creatures—transparent, flowerlike animals with sacs for bodies attached to many arms—and belong to the same ancient category as sea jellies. If you touch a hydra in one place, the nerve net spreads the signals indiscriminately, and the hydra twitches as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nerve net doesn’t process information—not in any meaningful sense. It merely transmits signals around the body. It connects the sensory stimulus (a poke on the hydra) to a muscle output (a twitch). After the emergence of the nerve net, however, nervous systems rapidly evolved a second level of complexity: the ability to enhance some signals over others. This simple but powerful trick of signal boosting is one of the basic ways that neurons manipulate information. It is a building block of almost all computations that we know about in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye of the crab is one of the best-studied examples. The crab has a compound eye with an array of detectors, each with a neuron inside it. If light falls on one detector, it activates the neuron inside. So far so good. But in an added pinch of complexity, each neuron is connected to its nearest neighbors, and because of those connections, the neurons compete with each other. When a neuron in one detector becomes active, it tends to suppress the activity of the neurons in the neighboring detectors, like a person in a crowd who is trying to shout the loudest while shushing the people nearest to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;The mechanism in the eye of a crab is arguably the simplest and most fundamental example of attention. Our human attention is merely an elaborated version of it, made of the same building blocks.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that if a blurry spot of light shines on the crab’s eye, with the brightest part of the spot hitting one detector, the neuron in that detector becomes highly active, wins the competition, and shuts down its neighbors. The pattern of activity across the set of detectors in the eye not only signals a bright spot, but also signals a ring of darkness around it. The signal is, in this way, enhanced. The crab eye takes a fuzzy, gray-scale reality and sharpens it into a high-contrast image with exaggerated, brighter peaks and darker shadows. This signal enhancement is a direct consequence of neurons inhibiting their neighbors, a process called lateral inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism in the eye of a crab is arguably the simplest and most fundamental example—the model A case—of attention. Signals compete with each other, the winning signals are boosted at the expense of the losing signals, and those winning signals can then go on to influence the animal’s movements. That is the computational essence of attention. Our human attention is merely an elaborated version of it, made of the same building blocks. You can find the crab-eye method of lateral inhibition at every stage of processing in the human nervous system, from the eye to the highest levels of thought in the cerebral cortex. The origin of attention lies deep in evolutionary time, more than half a billion years ago, with a surprisingly simple innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crabs belong to an extensive group of animals, the arthropods, which includes spiders and insects and other creatures with hard, jointed exoskeletons and which branched off from other animals about 600 MYA. The most famous extinct arthropod, the one with the biggest fan club today, is the trilobite—a leggy, jointed creature almost like a miniature horseshoe crab, which crawled about the bottom of Cambrian seas as early as 540 MYA. When trilobites died and sank into very fine silt on the ocean floor, their faceted eyes were sometimes fossilized in amazing detail. If you look at a trilobite fossil and examine its bulging eyes through a magnifying glass, you can often still see the orderly mosaic of individual detectors. Judging from these fossilized details, the trilobite’s eye must have closely resembled a modern crab’s eye in its organization and is likely to have used the same trick of competition between neighboring detectors to sharpen its view of the ancient seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an animal built piecemeal with “local” attention. In that animal, each part of the body would function like a separate device, filtering its own information and picking out the most salient signals. One of the eyes might say, “This particular spot is especially bright. Never mind the other spots.” Meanwhile, independently, one of the legs says, “I’ve just been poked hard right here. Ignore the lighter touches nearby!” An animal with only this capability would act like a collection of separate agents that happen to be physically glued together, each agent shouting out its own signals, triggering its own actions. The animal’s behavior would be, at best, chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a coherent response to its environment, the animal needs a more centralized attention. Can many separate sources of input—the eyes, the body, the legs, the ears, the chemical sensors— pool their information together in one place for a global sorting and a competition among signals? That convergence would allow the animal to select the most vivid object in its environment, the one that seems most important at the moment, and then generate a single, meaningful response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows when that type of centralized attention first appeared, partly because nobody is certain which animals have it and which ones don’t. Vertebrates have a central attention processor. But the mechanisms of attention have not been as thoroughly studied in invertebrates. Many types of animals, such as segmented worms and slugs, do not have a central brain. Instead they have clusters of neurons, or ganglia, scattered throughout their bodies to perform local computations. They probably don’t have centralized attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthropods, such as crabs, insects, and spiders, are better candidates for centralized attention. They have a central brain, or at least an aggregate of neurons in the head that is larger than any of the others in their bodies. That large ganglion may have evolved partly because of the requirements of vision. The eyes being in the head, and vision being the most complicated and information-intensive sense, the head gets the largest share of neurons. Some aspects of smell, taste, hearing, and touch also converge on that central ganglion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insects are brainier than people think. When you swat at a fly and it manages to escape—as it almost always does—it isn’t just darting away on a simple reflex. It probably has something that we can call central attention, or the ability to rapidly focus its processing resources on whatever part of its world is most important at the moment, in order to generate a coordinated response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish are true aliens with respect to us. No other intelligent animal is as far from us on the tree of life. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopuses are the superstars of the invertebrates because of their astonishing intelligence. They’re considered mollusks, like clams or snails. Mollusks probably first appeared about 550 MYA and remained relatively simple, at least in the organization of their nervous systems, for hundreds of millions of years. One branch, the cephalopods, eventually evolved a complex brain and sophisticated behavior and may have reached something close to the modern form of an octopus around 300 MYA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish are true aliens with respect to us. No other intelligent animal is as far from us on the tree of life. They show us that big-brained smartness is not a one-off event, because it evolved independently at least twice—first among the vertebrates and then again among the invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopuses are excellent visual predators. A good predator must be smarter and better coordinated than its prey, and using vision to locate and recognize prey is especially computationally intensive. No other sensory system has such a fire hose of varied information pouring in and such a need for an intelligent way to focus on useful subsets of that information. Attention, therefore, is the name of the game for a visual predator. Maybe that lifestyle has something to do with the expansion of octopus intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, the octopus evolved an extraordinary nervous system. It can use tools, solve problems, and show unexpected creativity. In a now classic demonstration, octopuses can learn to open a glass jar by unscrewing the top in order to get to a tasty morsel within. The octopus has a central brain and also an independent, smaller processor in each arm, giving it a unique mixture of centralized and distributed command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The octopus also probably has self models—rich, constantly updated bundles of information to monitor its body and behavior. From an engineering perspective, it would need self models to function effectively. For example, it might have some form of a body schema that keeps track of the shape and structure of its body in order to coordinate movement. (Perhaps each arm has its own arm schema.) In that sense, you could say that an octopus knows about itself. It possesses information about itself and about the outside world, and that information results in complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of these truly wonderful traits do not mean that an octopus is conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness researchers sometimes use the term objective awareness to mean that the information has gotten in and is being processed in a manner that affects behavioral choice. In that rather low-bar definition, one could say that a microwave is aware of the time setting and a self-driving car is aware of the looming obstacle. Yes, an octopus is objectively aware of itself and of the objects around it. It contains the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it subjectively aware? If it could talk, would it claim to have a subjective, conscious experience the same way that you or I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask the octopus. Imagine a somewhat improbable thought experiment. Suppose we’ve gotten hold of a crazy science fiction device—let’s call it the Speechinator 5000 that serves as an information-to-speech translator. It has a port that can be plugged into the octopus’s head, and it verbalizes the information found in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might say things like “There is a fish” if the octopus’s visual system contains information about a nearby fish. The device might say, “I am an entity with a bunch of limbs that move in this and that way.” It might say, “Getting a fish out of a jar requires turning that circular part.” It would say many things, reflective of the information that we know is contained inside the octopus’s nervous system. But we don’t know if it would say, “I have a subjective, private experience—a consciousness—of that fish. I don’t just process it. I experience it. Seeing a fish feels like something.” We don’t know if its brain contains that type of information because we don’t know what the octopus’s self models tell it. It may lack the machinery to model what consciousness is or to attribute that property to itself. Consciousness could be irrelevant to the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The octopus conundrum is an instructive example of how an animal can be complex and intelligent, and yet we are, so far, unable to answer the question of its subjective experience or even whether the question has any meaning for that creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Yes, an octopus is objectively aware of itself and of the objects around it. But is it subjectively aware? If it could talk, would it claim to have a subjective, conscious experience the same way that you or I do?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one source of confusion here is the automatic and powerful human urge to attribute consciousness to the objects around us. We are prone to see consciousness in puppets and other, even less likely objects. People sometimes believe that their houseplants are conscious. An octopus, with its richly complex behavior and its large eyes filled with focused attention, is a far more compelling inkblot test, so to speak, triggering a strong social perception in us. Not only do we know, intellectually, that it gathers objective information about its world, but we can’t help feeling that it must have a subjective awareness as well emanating out of those soulful eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, we don’t know, and the sense we get of its conscious mind says more about us than about the octopus. The experts who study octopuses risk becoming the least reliable observers on this point, because they are the ones most likely to be entranced by these wonderful creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I’m not saying that octopuses are not conscious. But the octopus nervous system is still so incompletely understood that we can’t yet compare its brain organization with ours and guess how similar it might be in its algorithms and self models. To make those types of comparisons, we will need to examine animals in our own lineage, the vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday night, Variety &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/avid-mac-pro-corrupted-hollywood-1203347033/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that film editors around Los Angeles who had Avid Media Composer software installed were suddenly finding that their Macs were unable to reboot. The publication speculated that malware may have been the cause. On Wednesday, Google disclosed the real cause—a Chrome browser update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it was a new version of Chrome's Keystone updater that caused so many Macs to stop rebooting, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1007358&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Chrome open bug post. When the update was installed on Macs that had disabled a security feature known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection&quot;&gt;system integrity prevention&lt;/a&gt; and met several other conditions, a crucial part of the Mac system file was damaged, a Google employee said in the forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This appears to be an issue with a new version of Google Keystone,&quot; a different Google employee wrote earlier in the thread. &quot;We have halted the rollout and are working on remediation right now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When your Mac gets a “varsectomy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIP, as system integrity protection is usually abbreviated, was introduced in 2015 in the El Capitan version of macOS (called OS X at the time). As its name suggests, SIP is designed to protect the integrity of the OS by, among other things, protecting certain files and folders from being deleted or modified, except by specific, authorized processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear a bug in the Chrome update inadvertently attempted to modify parts of the macOS file system. When SIP was enabled—as it is by default—SIP worked as designed and prevented the change. When the protection was disabled, however, the file system was modified in a way that prevented Macs from rebooting. Specifically, according to the Chrome bug thread, the buggy Chrome update removed a crucial &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link&quot;&gt;symbolic link&lt;/a&gt; pointing to the /var folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This results in system instability that may include failure to launch new UI applications, failure to resolve hostnames in most already-running programs, and failure to reboot successfully,&quot; one of the Google employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific conditions required for the Chrome update to make this change are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIP must be disabled (or not present, as is the case pre-OS X 10.11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The root directory, /, must be writable by the logged-in user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Keystone version containing the bug, 1.2.13.75, must be installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keystone must update a product that it supervises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason so many users of the Avid Media Composer program were affected, Mac enterprise blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrmacintosh.com/google-chrome-keystone-is-modifying-var-symlink-on-non-sip-macs-causing-boot-issues/&quot;&gt;Mr. Macintosh reported&lt;/a&gt;, is that some users of the film-editing software must disable SIP when using third-party graphics cards. The publication has dubbed the /var-killing bug &quot;varsectomy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has instructions for restoring unbootable Macs &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/15235262&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The process involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314&quot;&gt;booting into recovery mode&lt;/a&gt; and then opening a terminal window, which among other ways can be accessed from the utilities folder. From there, run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
chroot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD   # &quot;Macintosh HD&quot; is the default
rm -rf /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle
mv var var_back  # var may not exist, but this is fine
ln -sh private/var var
chflags -h restricted /var
chflags -h hidden /var
xattr -sw com.apple.rootless &quot;&quot; /var
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes right, the Mac will restart with the buggy Chrome update no longer installed and with the damaged file system repaired. It wasn't immediately clear when a fixed version of the Chrome update will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open offices are a dead end</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What was We thinking? That’s the only question worth asking now about the clowncar start-up known as The We Company, the money-burning, co-working behemoth whose best-known brand is WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What’s a WeWork? What WeWork works on is work. The We Company takes out long-term leases on in-demand office buildings in more than 100 cities across the globe (lately, it’s even been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-the-workspace-giant-wants-to-be-its-own-landlord-using-other-investors-money-1526212801&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buying its own buildings&lt;/a&gt;). Then We redesigns, furnishes and variously modularizes the digs, aiming to profitably sublease small and large chunks of office space to start-ups and even big companies. Well, profitable in theory: The We Company &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/business/dealbook/wework-ipo.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;lost $1.7 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;[&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Farhad Manjoo will answer your questions about this column on Friday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern on Twitter:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fmanjoo&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;@fmanjoo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But this is fine, We said. Unlike other recent troubled start-ups, which at least had the decency to cover up their scandals, We stands out for its brazenness. Critics have long pointed out that We is saddled with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/5/24/18630126/wework-valuation-ipo-business-model-we-company&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a self-evidently faulty business model&lt;/a&gt; that leaves it open to real estate downturns, and that its co-founder and just-pushed-out chief executive, Adam Neumann, was a walking parody of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high-minded impulsivity and self-dealing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And yet since its founding in 2010, WeWork has been one of the most highly-valued start-ups on the planet, assessed at $47 billion in its last private round of fund-raising. WeWork’s Ikea-chic, couch-and-bench-furnished open office aesthetic has also become a cultural template, the sitcom backdrop for a new generation’s workplace travails. We’s founders and investors now often position their company as a workplace innovator — in forcing workers from different companies to work very closely together, We was not only a business marvel but, they suggested, also a feel-good, Goopy force for &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/business/the-wework-manifesto-first-office-space-next-the-world.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;planetary collaboration and unity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then, last week, came the inevitable blow up. After finding lackluster investor interest in its business, We delayed its &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/business/dealbook/wework-ipo.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;long-planned stock offering&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, the company pushed out &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/business/dealbook/wework-ceo-adam-neumann.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neumann as C.E.O&lt;/a&gt;. The tech business site The Information reported that We is considering laying off &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/wework-bankers-have-discussed-laying-off-one-third-of-workforce&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;up to a third of its work force&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I’ve been hung up on how all this happened: How did so many people put so much money into something so many were warning would end up so badly? What was We thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And then it hit me: We &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WeWork? Not really. WeCan’t! We’reTooDistracted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Much will be written in the coming weeks about how WeWork failed investors and employees. But I want to spotlight another constituency. WeWork’s fundamental business idea — to cram as many people as possible into swank, high-dollar office space, and then shower them with snacks and foosball-type perks so they overlook the distraction-carnival of their desks — fails office workers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The model fails you even if you don’t work at a WeWork, because WeWork’s underlying idea has been an inspiration for a range of workplaces, possibly even your own. As urban rents crept up and the economy reached full employment over the last decade, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/companies-are-packing-workers-in-like-sardines/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American offices got more and more stuffed&lt;/a&gt;. On average, workers now get about 194 square feet of office space per person, down about 8 percent since 2009, according to a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.naiop.org/2018/05/top-trends-and-metrics-to-watch-in-u-s-office-space/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report by the real estate firm Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. WeWork has been accelerating the trend. At its newest offices, the company can more than double the density of most other offices, giving each worker &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/wework-squeezes-people-just-half-space-most-offices&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less than 50 square feet of space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As a socially anxious introvert with a lot of bespoke workplace rituals (I can’t write without aromatherapy), I used to think I was simply a weirdo for finding modern offices insufferable. I’ve been working from my cozy home office for more than a decade, and now, when I go to the Times’ headquarters in New York — where, for financial reasons, desks were recently converted from cubicles into open office benches — I cannot for the life of me get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But after chatting with colleagues, I realized it’s not just me, and not just the Times: Modern offices aren’t designed for deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last week, I put out a call on Twitter for stories about this phenomenon; I was inundated with tales of woe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, told me that he only goes to the office for meetings; for writing, editing and other work that demands concentration, he has to work from home, because the office is far too distracting. “My day starts with some meetings and ends with some meetings, but time in the middle is when I should do work‚ and I think it’s a problem that I don’t see my office as a great place to get that work done,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A magazine journalist who declined to be named echoed this idea: Because of a lack of desk privacy, “I can’t just make call after call the way I can when I’m working from home,” she told me over text. But working from home brings another set of worries. “A lot of times I’ll write from home, but then I feel anxiety about not being at the office — wondering if my editors don’t think I’m actually working, etc. But solving that — going into the office — means I don’t actually work as much!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many companies are aware of the risks of open office distraction, and some are responsive to workers’ concerns. Carmel DeAmicis, who works as an editor at Figma, a software company based in San Francisco, told me that she had to write a lengthy memo to her bosses to get them to set up a “quiet area” in the office. Her effort was successful — she and other workers are now hooked on the quiet area — but perhaps ephemeral. As the company has grown, it has had to claw back some of the quiet area to fit in more desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Her experience highlights the have-and-have-not nature of space and privacy at work. People who work for bigger, richer companies are at an advantage. Microsoft is in the middle of a multi-billion-dollar campus redesign, and a key goal, the company says, is to move away from one-size open offices in favor of lots of different kinds of work spaces for different kinds of workers. Your WeWork-bound start-up will not enjoy similar luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The scourge of open offices is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/07/in-open-offices-workers-chat-70-less-are-less-productive-and-email-more/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not a new subject for ranting&lt;/a&gt;. Open offices were sold to workers as a boon to collaboration — liberated from barriers, stuffed in like sardines, people would chat more and, supposedly, come up with lots of brilliant new ideas. Yet &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/18/open-office-plans-are-bad-you-thought/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study after study&lt;/a&gt; has shown open offices to foster seclusion more than innovation; in order to combat noise, the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/nyregion/as-office-space-shrinks-so-does-privacy-for-workers.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;loss of privacy&lt;/a&gt; and the sense of being watched, people in an open office put on headphones, talk less, and feel terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WeWork is the ultimate manifestation of this bad idea. Its rise is a sign that we have no good way, in modern life, to value and guard private, distraction-free spaces. Our online lives are crammed with distraction, and our work lives are no different, either. WeWork? At best, WeTry.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>HTTP/3: the past, the present, and the future</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;During last year’s Birthday Week &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-quicening/&quot;&gt;we announced preliminary support for QUIC and HTTP/3&lt;/a&gt; (or “HTTP over QUIC” as it was known back then), the new standard for the web, enabling faster, more reliable, and more secure connections to web endpoints like websites and APIs. We also let our customers join a waiting list to try QUIC and HTTP/3 as soon as they became available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/http3-tube@2x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve been working with industry peers through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ietf.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, to iterate on the HTTP/3 and QUIC standards documents. In parallel with the standards maturing, we’ve also worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/enjoy-a-slice-of-quic-and-rust/&quot;&gt;improving support&lt;/a&gt; on our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are now happy to announce that QUIC and HTTP/3 support is available on the Cloudflare edge network.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re excited to be joined in this announcement by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, two of the leading browser vendors and partners in our effort to make the web faster and more reliable for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of Ryan Hamilton, Staff Software Engineer at Google, “HTTP/3 should make the web better for everyone. The Chrome and Cloudflare teams have worked together closely to bring HTTP/3 and QUIC from nascent standards to widely adopted technologies for improving the web. Strong partnership between industry leaders is what makes Internet standards innovations possible, and we look forward to our continued work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you, a Cloudflare customer who uses our services and edge network to make your web presence faster and more secure? Once HTTP/3 support is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#how-do-i-enable-http-3-for-my-domain&quot;&gt;enabled for your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, your customers can interact with your websites and APIs using HTTP/3. We’ve been steadily inviting customers on our HTTP/3 waiting list to turn on the feature (so keep an eye out for an email from us), and in the coming weeks we’ll make the feature available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this announcement mean if you’re a user of the Internet interacting with sites and APIs through a browser and other clients? Starting today, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-google-chrome-as-an-http-3-client&quot;&gt;use Chrome Canary&lt;/a&gt; to interact with Cloudflare and other servers over HTTP/3. For those of you looking for a command line client, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-curl&quot;&gt;curl also provides support for HTTP/3&lt;/a&gt;. Instructions for using Chrome and curl with HTTP/3 follow later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chicken-and-the-egg&quot;&gt;The Chicken and the Egg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standards innovation on the Internet has historically been difficult because of a chicken and egg problem: which needs to come first, server support (like Cloudflare, or other large sources of response data) or client support (like browsers, operating systems, etc)? Both sides of a connection need to support a new communications protocol for it to be any use at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a long history of driving web standards forward, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-http2/&quot;&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt; (the version of HTTP preceding HTTP/3), to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tls-1-3/&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt;, to things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-sni/&quot;&gt;encrypted SNI&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve pushed standards forward by partnering with like-minded organizations who share in our desire to help build a better Internet. Our efforts to move HTTP/3 into the mainstream are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the HTTP/3 standards development process, we’ve been working closely with industry partners to build and validate client HTTP/3 support compatible with our edge support. We’re thrilled to be joined by Google Chrome and curl, both of which can be used today to make requests to the Cloudflare edge over HTTP/3. Mozilla Firefox expects to ship support in a nightly release soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing this all together: today is a good day for Internet users; widespread rollout of HTTP/3 will mean a faster web experience for all, and today’s support is a large step toward that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, today is a good day for the Internet: Chrome, curl, and Cloudflare, and soon, Mozilla, rolling out experimental but functional, support for HTTP/3 in quick succession shows that the Internet standards creation process works. Coordinated by the Internet Engineering Task Force, industry partners, competitors, and other key stakeholders can come together to craft standards that benefit the entire Internet, not just the behemoths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Rescorla, CTO of Firefox, summed it up nicely: “Developing a new network protocol is hard, and getting it right requires everyone to work together. Over the past few years, we've been working with Cloudflare and other industry partners to test TLS 1.3 and now HTTP/3 and QUIC. Cloudflare's early server-side support for these protocols has helped us work the interoperability kinks out of our client-side Firefox implementation. We look forward to advancing the security and performance of the Internet together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/HTTP3-partnership@2x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-we-get-here&quot;&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive deeper into HTTP/3, let’s have a quick look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-3-from-root-to-tip/&quot;&gt;evolution of HTTP over the years&lt;/a&gt; in order to better understand why HTTP/3 is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started back in 1996 with the publication of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.0 specification&lt;/a&gt; which defined the basic HTTP textual wire format as we know it today (for the purposes of this post I’m pretending HTTP/0.9 never existed). In HTTP/1.0 a new TCP connection is created for each request/response exchange between clients and servers, meaning that all requests incur a latency penalty as the TCP and TLS handshakes are completed before each request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/07/http-request-over-tcp-tls@2x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse still, rather than sending all outstanding data as fast as possible once the connection is established, TCP enforces a warm-up period called “slow start”, which allows the TCP congestion control algorithm to determine the amount of data that can be in flight at any given moment before congestion on the network path occurs, and avoid flooding the network with packets it can’t handle. But because new connections have to go through the slow start process, they can’t use all of the network bandwidth available immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 revision of the HTTP specification&lt;/a&gt; tried to solve these problems a few years later by introducing the concept of “keep-alive” connections, that allow clients to reuse TCP connections, and thus amortize the cost of the initial connection establishment and slow start across multiple requests. But this was no silver bullet: while multiple requests could share the same connection, they still had to be serialized one after the other, so a client and server could only execute a single request/response exchange at any given time for each connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the web evolved, browsers found themselves needing more and more concurrency when fetching and rendering web pages as the number of resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, …) required by each web site increased over the years. But since HTTP/1.1 only allowed clients to do one HTTP request/response exchange at a time, the only way to gain concurrency at the network layer was to use multiple TCP connections to the same origin in parallel, thus losing most of the benefits of keep-alive connections. While connections would still be reused to a certain (but lesser) extent, we were back at square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, more than a decade later, came SPDY and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540&quot;&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt;, which, among other things, introduced the concept of HTTP “streams”: an abstraction that allows HTTP implementations to concurrently multiplex different HTTP exchanges onto the same TCP connection, allowing browsers to more efficiently reuse TCP connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-7.43.01-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, yet again, this was no silver bullet! HTTP/2 solves the original problem — inefficient use of a single TCP connection — since multiple requests/responses can now be transmitted over the same connection at the same time. However, all requests and responses are equally affected by packet loss (e.g. due to network congestion), even if the data that is lost only concerns a single request. This is because while the HTTP/2 layer can segregate different HTTP exchanges on separate streams, TCP has no knowledge of this abstraction, and all it sees is a stream of bytes with no particular meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of TCP is to deliver the entire stream of bytes, in the correct order, from one endpoint to the other. When a TCP packet carrying some of those bytes is lost on the network path, it creates a gap in the stream and TCP needs to fill it by resending the affected packet when the loss is detected. While doing so, none of the successfully delivered bytes that follow the lost ones can be delivered to the application, even if they were not themselves lost and belong to a completely independent HTTP request. So they end up getting unnecessarily delayed as TCP cannot know whether the application would be able to process them without the missing bits. This problem is known as “head-of-line blocking”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-http-3&quot;&gt;Enter HTTP/3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where HTTP/3 comes into play: instead of using TCP as the transport layer for the session, it uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/&quot;&gt;QUIC, a new Internet transport protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which, among other things, introduces streams as first-class citizens at the transport layer. QUIC streams share the same QUIC connection, so no additional handshakes and slow starts are required to create new ones, but QUIC streams are delivered independently such that in most cases packet loss affecting one stream doesn't affect others. This is possible because QUIC packets are encapsulated on top of UDP datagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using UDP allows much more flexibility compared to TCP, and enables QUIC implementations to live fully in user-space — updates to the protocol’s implementations are not tied to operating systems updates as is the case with TCP. With QUIC, HTTP-level streams can be simply mapped on top of QUIC streams to get all the benefits of HTTP/2 without the head-of-line blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUIC also combines the typical 3-way TCP handshake with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt;'s handshake. Combining these steps means that encryption and authentication are provided by default, and also enables faster connection establishment. In other words, even when a new QUIC connection is required for the initial request in an HTTP session, the latency incurred before data starts flowing is lower than that of TCP with TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/07/http-request-over-quic@2x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why not just use HTTP/2 on top of QUIC, instead of creating a whole new HTTP revision? After all, HTTP/2 also offers the stream multiplexing feature. As it turns out, it’s somewhat more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that some of the HTTP/2 features can be mapped on top of QUIC very easily, that’s not true for all of them. One in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-of-http-2/&quot;&gt;HTTP/2’s header compression scheme called HPACK&lt;/a&gt;, heavily depends on the order in which different HTTP requests and responses are delivered to the endpoints. QUIC enforces delivery order of bytes within single streams, but does not guarantee ordering among different streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior required the creation of a new HTTP header compression scheme, called QPACK, which fixes the problem but requires changes to the HTTP mapping. In addition, some of the features offered by HTTP/2 (like per-stream flow control) are already offered by QUIC itself, so they were dropped from HTTP/3 in order to remove unnecessary complexity from the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;http-3-powered-by-a-delicious-quiche&quot;&gt;HTTP/3, powered by a delicious quiche&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUIC and HTTP/3 are very exciting standards, promising to address many of the shortcomings of previous standards and ushering in a new era of performance on the web. So how do we go from exciting standards documents to working implementation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's QUIC and HTTP/3 support is powered by quiche, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/enjoy-a-slice-of-quic-and-rust/&quot;&gt;our own open-source implementation written in Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-7.39.59-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find it on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche&quot;&gt;github.com/cloudflare/quiche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We announced quiche a few months ago and since then have added support for the HTTP/3 protocol, on top of the existing QUIC support. We have designed quiche in such a way that it can now be used to implement HTTP/3 clients and servers or just plain QUIC ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-enable-http-3-for-my-domain&quot;&gt;How do I enable HTTP/3 for my domain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we have started on-boarding customers that signed up for the waiting list. If you are on the waiting list and have received an email from us communicating that you can now enable the feature for your websites, you can simply go to the Cloudflare dashboard and flip the switch from the &quot;Network&quot; tab manually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/07/http3-toggle-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect to make the HTTP/3 feature available to all customers in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once enabled, you can experiment with HTTP/3 in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-google-chrome-as-an-http-3-client&quot;&gt;Using Google Chrome as an HTTP/3 client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use the Chrome browser to connect to your website over HTTP/3, you first need to download and install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/&quot;&gt;latest Canary build&lt;/a&gt;. Then all you need to do to enable HTTP/3 support is starting Chrome Canary with the “--enable-quic” and “--quic-version=h3-23” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags&quot;&gt;command-line arguments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Chrome is started with the required arguments, you can just type your domain in the address bar, and see it loaded over HTTP/3 (you can use the Network tab in Chrome’s Developer Tools to check what protocol version was used). Note that due to how HTTP/3 is negotiated between the browser and the server, HTTP/3 might not be used for the first few connections to the domain, so you should try to reload the page a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this seems too complicated, don’t worry, as the HTTP/3 support in Chrome will become more stable as time goes on, enabling HTTP/3 will become easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Network tab in the Developer Tools shows when browsing this very blog over HTTP/3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-1.27.34-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-1.27.34-PM&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that due to the experimental nature of the HTTP/3 support in Chrome, the protocol is actually identified as “http2+quic/99” in Developer Tools, but don’t let that fool you, it is indeed HTTP/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-curl&quot;&gt;Using curl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curl command-line tool also &lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/09/11/curl-7-66-0-the-parallel-http-3-future-is-here/&quot;&gt;supports HTTP/3 as an experimental feature&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/curl/curl&quot;&gt;latest version from git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version&quot;&gt;follow the instructions on how to enable HTTP/3 support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're running macOS, we've also made it easy to install an HTTP/3 equipped version of curl via Homebrew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt; % brew install --HEAD -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/homebrew-cloudflare/master/curl.rb
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to perform an HTTP/3 request all you need is to add the “--http3” command-line flag to a normal curl command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt; % ./curl -I https://blog.cloudflare.com/ --http3

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-quiche-s-http3-client&quot;&gt;Using quiche’s http3-client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also provide an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/examples/http3-client.rs&quot;&gt;HTTP/3 command-line client&lt;/a&gt; (as well as a command-line server) built on top of quiche, that you can use to experiment with HTTP/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get it running, first clone quiche’s GitHub repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then build it. You need a working Rust and Cargo installation for this to work (we recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustup.rs/&quot;&gt;rustup&lt;/a&gt; to easily setup a working Rust development environment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;$ cargo build --examples
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally you can execute an HTTP/3 request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;$ RUST_LOG=info target/debug/examples/http3-client https://blog.cloudflare.com/
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months we’ll be working on improving and optimizing our QUIC and HTTP/3 implementation, and will eventually allow everyone to enable this new feature without having to go through a waiting list. We'll continue updating our implementation as standards evolve, which &lt;strong&gt;may result in breaking changes&lt;/strong&gt; between draft versions of the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few new features on our roadmap that we're particularly excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;connection-migration&quot;&gt;Connection migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important feature that QUIC enables is seamless and transparent migration of connections between different networks (such as your home WiFi network and your carrier’s mobile network as you leave for work in the morning) without requiring a whole new connection to be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-7.39.44-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature will require some additional changes to our infrastructure, but it’s something we are excited to offer our customers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zero-round-trip-time-resumption&quot;&gt;Zero Round Trip Time Resumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like TLS 1.3, QUIC supports a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/&quot;&gt;mode of operation that allows clients to start sending HTTP requests before the connection handshake has completed&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t yet support this feature in our QUIC deployment, but we’ll be working on making it available, just like we already do for our TLS 1.3 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;http-3-it-s-alive-&quot;&gt;HTTP/3: it's alive!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to support HTTP/3 and allow our customers to experiment with it while efforts to standardize QUIC and HTTP/3 are still ongoing. We'll continue working alongside other organizations, including Google and Mozilla, to finalize the QUIC and HTTP/3 standards and encourage broad adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to a faster, more reliable, more secure web experience for all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Interview with the Guy Who Tried to Frame Me for Heroin Possession</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/interview-with-the-guy-who-tried-to-frame-me-for-heroin-possession/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/interview-with-the-guy-who-tried-to-frame-me-for-heroin-possession/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;In April 2013, I received via U.S. mail more than a gram of pure heroin as part of a scheme to get me arrested for drug possession. But the plan failed and the Ukrainian mastermind behind it soon after was imprisoned for unrelated cybercrime offenses. That individual recently gave his first interview since finishing his jail time here in the states, and he’s shared some select (if often abrasive and coarse) details on how he got into cybercrime and why. Below are a few translated excerpts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;When I first encountered now-31-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Sergei “Fly,” “Flycracker,” “MUXACC” Vovnenko&lt;/strong&gt; in 2013, he was the administrator of the fraud forum “thecc[dot]bz,” an exclusive and closely guarded Russian language board dedicated to financial fraud and identity theft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Many of the heavy-hitters from other fraud forums had a presence on Fly’s forum, and collectively the group financed and ran a soup-to-nuts network for turning hacked credit card data into mounds of cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Vovnenko first came onto my radar after his alter ego Fly published a blog entry that led with an image of my bloodied, severed head and included my credit report, copies of identification documents, pictures of our front door, information about family members, and so on. Fly had invited all of his cybercriminal friends to ruin my financial identity and that of my family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Somewhat curious about what might have precipitated this outburst, I was secretly given access to Fly’s cybercrime forum and learned he’d freshly hatched a plot to have heroin sent to my home. The plan was to have one of his forum lackeys spoof a call from one of my neighbors to the police when the drugs arrived, complaining that drugs were being delivered to our house and being sold out of our home by Yours Truly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Thankfully, someone on Fly’s forum also posted a link to the tracking number for the drug shipment. Before the smack arrived, I had a police officer come out and take a report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;After the heroin showed up, I gave the drugs to the local police and wrote about the experience in &lt;a href=&quot;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/07/mail-from-the-velvet-cybercrime-underground/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Mail From the Velvet Cybercrime Underground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;ngry that I’d foiled the plan to have me arrested for being a smack dealer, Fly or someone on his forum had a local florist send a gaudy floral arrangement in the shape of a giant cross to my home, complete with a menacing message that addressed my wife and was signed, “Velvet Crabs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_26621&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-26621&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fly-cross.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;792&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fly-cross.jpg 2448w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fly-cross-285x380.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fly-cross-600x800.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The floral arrangement that Fly or one of his forum lackeys had delivered to my home in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Vovnenko was arrested in Italy in the summer of 2014 on identity theft and botnet charges, and spent some 15 months in arguably Italy’s worst prison contesting his extradition to the United States. Those efforts failed, and he soon pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud, and spent several years bouncing around America’s prison system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Although Vovnenko sent me a total of three letters from prison in Naples (a hand-written apology letter and two friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback-580x503.png&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;postcards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), he never responded to my requests to meet him following his trial and conviction on cybercrime charges in the United States. I suppose that is fair: To my everlasting dismay, I never responded to his Italian dispatches (the first I asked to be professionally analyzed and translated before I would touch it).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_32576&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-32576&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback.png 952w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback-580x503.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback-940x816.png 940w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Seasons greetings from my pen pal, Flycracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;After serving his 41 month sentence in the U.S., Vovnenko was deported, although it’s unclear where he currently resides (the interview excerpted here suggests he’s back in Italy, but Fly doesn’t exactly confirm that). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;In an interview published on the Russian-language security blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://krober.biz/?p=3200&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Krober.biz,&lt;/a&gt; Vovnenko said he began stealing early in life, and by 13 was already getting picked up for petty robberies and thefts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;A translated English version of the interview was produced and shared with KrebsOnSecurity by analysts at New York City-based cyber intelligence firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flashpoint-intel.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-48932&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the mid-aughts, Vovnenko settled with his mother in Naples, Italy, but he had trouble keeping a job for more than a few days. Until a chance encounter led to a front job at a den of thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I came to my Mom in Naples, I could not find a permanent job. Having settled down somewhere at a new job, I would either get kicked out or leave in the first two days. I somehow didn’t succeed with employment until I was invited to work in a wine shop in the historical center of Naples, where I kinda had to wipe the dust from the bottles. But in fact, the wine shop turned out to be a real den and a sales outlet of hashish and crack. So my job was to be on the lookout and whenever the cops showed up, take a bag of goods and leave under the guise of a tourist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine and hash were plentiful at his employer’s place of work, and Vovnenko said he availed himself of both abundantly. After he’d saved enough to buy a computer, Fly started teaching himself how to write programs and hack stuff. He quickly became enthralled with the romanticized side of cybercrime — the allure of instant cash — and decided this was his true vocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After watching movies and reading books about hackers, I really wanted to become a sort of virtual bandit who robs banks without leaving home,” Vovnenko recalled. “Once, out of curiosity, I wrote an SMS bomber that used a registration form on a dating site, bypassing the captcha through some kind of rookie mistake in the shitty code. The bomber would launch from the terminal and was written in Perl, and upon completion of its work, it gave out my phone number and email. I shared the bomber somewhere on one of my many awkward sites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And a couple of weeks later they called me. Nah, not the cops, but some guy who comes from Sri Lanka who called himself Enrico. He told me that he used my program and earned a lot of money, and now he wants to share some of it with me and hire me. By a happy coincidence, the guy also lived in Naples.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we met in person, he told me that he used my bomber to fuck with a telephone company called Wind. This telephone company had such a bonus service: for each incoming SMS you received two cents on the balance. Well, of course, this guy bought a bunch of SIM cards and began to bomb them, getting credits and loading them into his paid lines, similar to how phone sex works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his job soon interfered with his drug habit, and he was let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the meeting, Enrico gave me 2K euros, and this was the first money I’ve earned, as it is fashionable to say these days, on ‘cybercrime’. I left my previous job and began to work closely with Enrico. But always stoned out of my mind, I didn’t do a good job and struggled with drug addiction at that time. I was addicted to cocaine, as a result, I was pulling a lot more money out of Enrico than my work brought him. And he kicked me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After striking out on his own, Vovnenko says he began getting into carding big time, and was introduced to several other big players on the scene. One of those was a cigarette smuggler who used the nickname Ponchik (“Doughnut”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/who-is-paunch/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;same Ponchik who was arrested in 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as being the mastermind behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=blackhole&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Blackhole exploit kit&lt;/a&gt;, a crimeware package that fueled an overnight explosion in malware attacks via Web browser vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Vovnenko had settled on some schemes that were generating reliably large amounts of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;“I’ve never stood still and was not focusing on carding only, with the money I earned, I started buying dumps and testing them at friends’ stores,” Vovnenko said. “Mules, to whom I signed the hotlines, were also signed up for cashing out the loads, giving them a mere 10 percent for their work. Things seemed to be going well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAN MAIL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large chronological gap in Vovnenko’s account of his cybercrime life story from that point on until the time he and his forum friends started sending heroin, large bags of feces and other nasty stuff to our Northern Virginia home in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vovnenko claims he never sent anything and that it was all done by members of his forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Tell me about the packages to Krebs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That ain’t me. Suitcase filled with sketchy money, dildoes, and a bouquet of coffin wildflowers. They sent all sorts of crazy shit. Forty or so guys would send. When I was already doing time, one of the dudes sent it. By the way, Krebs wanted to see me. But the lawyer suggested this was a bad idea. Maybe he wanted to look into my eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one part of the interview, Fly is asked about but only briefly touches on how he was caught. I wanted to add some context here because this part of the story is richly ironic, and perhaps a tad cathartic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time Fly was taking bitcoin donations for a fund to purchase heroin on my behalf, he was also engaged to be married to a nice young woman. But Fly apparently did not fully trust his bride-to-be, so he had malware installed on her system that forwarded him copies of all email that she sent and received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_22059&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/heroin1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-22059&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/heroin1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/heroin1.png 1002w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/heroin1-285x168.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/heroin1-600x355.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Fly,/Flycracker discussing the purchase of a gram of heroin from Silk Road seller “10toes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Fly would make at least two big operational security mistakes in this spying effort: First, he had his fiancée’s messages forwarded to an email account he’d used for plenty of cybercriminal stuff related to his various “Fly” identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistake number two was the password for his email account was the same as one of his cybercrime forum admin accounts. And unbeknownst to him at the time, that forum was hacked, with all email addresses and hashed passwords exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, investigators were reading Fly’s email, including the messages forwarded from his wife’s account that had details about their upcoming nuptials, such as shipping addresses for their wedding-related items and the full name of Fly’s fiancée. It didn’t take long to zero in on Fly’s location in Naples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may sound unlikely that a guy so immeshed in the cybercrime space could make such rookie security mistakes, I have found that a great many cybercriminals actually have worse operational security than the average Internet user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this may be because the nature of their activities requires them to create vast numbers of single- or brief-use accounts, and in general they tend to re-use credentials across multiple sites, or else pick very poor passwords — even for critical resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to elaborating on his hacking career, Fly talks a great deal about his time in various prisons (including their culinary habits), and an apparent longing or at least lingering fondness for the whole carding scene in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end, Fly says he’s considering going back to school, and that he may even take up information security as a study. I wish him luck in that whatever that endeavor is as long as he can also avoid stealing from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what I would have written many years ago to Fly had I not been already so traumatized by receiving postal mail from him. Perhaps it would go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dear Fly: Thank you for your letters. I am very sorry to hear about the delays in your travel plans. I wish you luck in all your endeavors — and I sincerely wish the next hopeful opportunity you alight upon does not turn out to be a pile of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s largest single-dish radio observatory is preparing to open to astronomers around the world, ushering in an era of exquisitely sensitive observations that could help in the hunt for gravitational waves and probe the mysterious fleeting blasts of radiation known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02455-1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02455-1&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;fast radio bursts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) in southern China has just passed a series of technical and performance assessments, and the Chinese government is expected to give the observatory the final green light to begin full operations at a review meeting scheduled for next month. “We do not see any roadblocks for the remaining transition,” says Di Li, the chief scientist of FAST. “I feel both excited and relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex project has not been without challenges — it has a radical design and initially struggled to attract staff, in part because of its remote location. But the pay-off for science will be immense. FAST will collect radio waves from an area twice the size of the next-largest single-dish telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese observatory’s massive size means that it can detect extremely faint radio-wave whispers from an array of sources across the Universe, such as the spinning cores of dead stars, known as pulsars, and hydrogen in distant galaxies. It will also explore a frontier in radioastronomy — using radio waves to locate exoplanets, which may harbour extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since testing began in 2016, only Chinese scientists have been able to lead projects studying the telescope’s preliminary data. But now, observation time will be accessible to researchers from around the world, says Zhiqiang Shen, director of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and co-chair of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ FAST supervisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m super excited to be able to use the telescope,” says Maura McLaughlin, a radioastronomer at West Virginia University in Morgantown, who wants to use FAST to study pulsars, including hunting for them in galaxies outside the Milky Way, that are too faint to see with current telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the testing phase, the telescope discovered more than 100 pulsars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eye in the sky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.2-billion-yuan (US$171-million) telescope, also known as Tianyan or ‘Eye of Heaven’, took half a decade to build in the remote Dawodang depression in the Guizhou province of southwest China. Its 500-metre-wide dish is made up of around 4,400 individual aluminium panels that more than 2,000 mechanical winches tilt and manoeuvre to focus on different areas of the sky. Although it sees less of the sky than some other cutting-edge radio telescopes, and has lower resolution than multidish arrays, FAST’s size makes it uniquely sensitive, says Li.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August and September, the instrument detected hundreds of bursts from a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source known as 121102. Many of these bursts were too faint to be perceived by other telescopes, says Li. “This is very exciting news,” says Yunfan Gerry Zhang, who studies FRBs at the University of California, Berkeley. No one knows what causes the mysterious bursts, but “the more pulses we have, the more we can learn about them”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAST examines only a tiny fraction of the sky at any one time, making it unlikely to discover many new FRBs, which are fleeting and occur in seemingly random locations. But the telescope’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'s“impressive sensitivity” will be useful for following up on sources in detail, says Laura Spitler, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. Repeat observations could allow scientists to learn about the environment from which an FRB emerged, and to determine whether the blasts vary in energy or recur with any set pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAST will also boost the efforts of an international collaboration that is trying to spot ripples in space-time as they sweep through the Galaxy, says McLaughlin. The International Pulsar Timing Array is using radio telescopes around the world to monitor the regular emissions from pulsars, looking for distortions that would reveal the passing of these low-frequency gravitational waves. By the 2030s, FAST should have racked up enough sensitive measurements to study individual sources of such waves, such as collisions of supermassive black holes, says McLaughlin. “That’s where FAST is really going to shine,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li says that he is particularly excited about the study of planets outside the Solar System. No exoplanets have yet been conclusively detected by their radio emissions, but FAST’s ability to spot faint, polarized waves might allow it to find the first examples, says Li. Polarized radio signals might come from planets with magnetic fields that, if similar to the one on Earth, could protect potential sources of life against radiation and keep the planets’ atmospheres attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying a planet in FAST’s wide beam is a challenge, because they are so faint and small. But Li’s team wants to boost the telescope’s performance by adding 36 dishes, each 5 metres wide. Although the dishes are relatively cheap, off-the-shelf products, together they will improve FAST’s spatial resolution by 100 times, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li hopes that FAST’s telescope operations will soon move from near the remote site to a $23-million data-processing centre being built in the city of Guiyang. He expects that the move to a major city will help attract more technical and engineering staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the team’s biggest hurdle is working out how to store and process the enormous amount of data that the telescope will churn out. The team are negotiating with the Chinese government to get additional funding for more data storage. “A successful review will definitely help,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing your plans makes you less motivated to accomplish them (2009)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sivers.org/zipit</guid>
<description>&lt;article readability=&quot;47.336789900812&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;

&lt;small&gt;2009-06-16&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t you announce your goals, so friends can support you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it good networking to tell people about your upcoming projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_%28New_Thought%29&quot;&gt;law of attraction&lt;/a&gt;” mean you should state your intention, and visualize the goal as already yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests done since 1933 show that &lt;strong&gt;people who talk about their intentions are less likely to make them happen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Announcing your plans to others satisfies your self-identity just enough that you’re less motivated to do the hard work needed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1933, W. Mahler found that if a person announced the solution to a problem, and was acknowledged by others, it was now in the brain as a “social reality”, even if the solution hadn’t actually been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYU psychology professor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/&quot;&gt;Peter Gollwitzer&lt;/a&gt; has been studying this since his 1982 book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=29xuRaMr1sIC&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Symbolic Self-Completion&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://interruptions.net/literature/Wicklund-BASP81.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf article here&lt;/a&gt;) — and recently published results of new tests in a research article, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf&quot;&gt;When Intentions Go Public: Does Social Reality Widen the Intention-Behavior Gap?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four different tests of 63 people found that &lt;strong&gt;those who kept their intentions private were more likely to achieve them&lt;/strong&gt; than those who made them public and were acknowledged by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve told people of your intentions, it gives you a “premature sense of completeness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have “identity symbols” in your brain that make your self-image. &lt;strong&gt;Since both actions and talk create symbols in your brain, talking satisfies the brain enough that it “neglects the pursuit of further symbols.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related test found that &lt;strong&gt;success on one sub-goal&lt;/strong&gt; (like eating healthy meals) &lt;strong&gt;reduced efforts on other important sub-goals&lt;/strong&gt; (like going to the gym) for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem unnatural to keep your intentions and plans private, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V68SMFrpFt8&quot;&gt;try it&lt;/a&gt;. If you do tell a friend, make sure not to say it as a satisfaction (“I’m going to run a marathon!”), but as dissatisfaction (“I want to lose 20 pounds, so kick my ass if I don’t, OK?”)&lt;/p&gt;
