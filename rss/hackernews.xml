&lt;p&gt;Translations of poems by Xu Lizhi (许立志), the Foxconn worker who took his own life on 30 September 2014, at the age of 24, in Shenzhen, China. Also includes an obituary with some explanatory notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Below are translations by friends of the Nao project, starting with Xu's departing poem and an obituary, followed by other poems from 2011 to 2014. By translating these poems, we aim to memorialize Xu, share some of his excellent literary work, and spread awareness that the harsh conditions, struggles and aspirations of Chinese migrant workers (including but not limited to Foxconn) have not diminished since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides&quot; class=&quot;bb-url&quot;&gt;the more widely-publicized spate of 18 attempted Foxconn suicides in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in 14 deaths. Insiders report that thereafter, although the frequency of suicides decreased (mainly due to Foxconn's installation of nets making it more difficult for workers to jump from their dormitories, along with the development of workers' collective resistance), such suicides have continued to the present. Including Xu Lizhi, at least 8 cases have been reported in the media since 2010, but insiders say that many other cases go unreported. We hope that in the future, workers in Foxconn and elsewhere manage to find ways around such companies' military-style discipline and surveillance, come together, and forge collective paths out of this capitalist world of death, into a world worth living in. Don't give up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of these poems were included in the &lt;span&gt;Shenzhen Evening News&lt;/span&gt; article linked and translated below; the others are widely available on the web, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.douban.com/note/431282993/&quot; class=&quot;bb-url&quot;&gt;this post on Douban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《我弥留之际》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“On My Deathbed”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我想再看一眼大海，目睹我半生的泪水有多汪洋&lt;br /&gt;I want to take another look at the ocean, behold the vastness of tears from half a lifetime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我想再爬一爬高高的山头，试着把丢失的灵魂喊回来&lt;br /&gt;I want to climb another mountain, try to call back the soul that I’ve lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我还想摸一摸天空，碰一碰那抹轻轻的蓝&lt;br /&gt;I want to touch the sky, feel that blueness so light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可是这些我都办不到了，我就要离开这个世界了&lt;br /&gt;But I can’t do any of this, so I’m leaving this world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所有听说过我的人们啊&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who’s heard of me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不必为我的离开感到惊讶&lt;br /&gt;Shouldn’t be surprised at my leaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;更不必叹息，或者悲伤&lt;br /&gt;Even less should you sigh or grieve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我来时很好，去时，也很好&lt;br /&gt;I was fine when I came, and fine when I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Xu Lizhi, 30 September 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shy, quiet, introverted, solitary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Xu Lizhi went [from his home in rural Jieyang, Guangdong] to work at [a] Foxconn [electronics factory in Shenzhen], beginning life on the assembly line. From 2012 until February of this year [2014], over 30 of his writings were published in Foxconn’s internal newspaper &lt;span&gt;Foxconn People&lt;/span&gt; (富士康人), including poems, essays, film reviews, and news commentaries {…} Xu posted the titles of these writings on his blog in a post called “The Maturation Given to Me by a Newspaper,” indicating his gratitude for this platform for his literary aspirations. The first time his friend Zheng (pseudonym) read Xu’s poetry, he was astonished to discover that this young man could be so talented. Henceforth, Zheng always looked for Xu’s writings in the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zheng’s impression was that Xu was a shy boy, “of few words, but not silent.” “Xu asserted his convictions, but he seemed quite solitary – very much the air of a poet.” When Zheng heard of Xu’s suicide, his entire [week-long] break for [China’s] National Day was shrouded in grief. He could not go outside for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turning feelings into poems; fearing they be read by family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Xu’s early poems were descriptions of life on the assembly line. In “Workshop, My Youth Was Stranded Here,” he described his conditions at the time: “Beside the assembly line, tens of thousands of workers [&lt;span&gt;dagongzhe&lt;/span&gt;] line up like words on a page/ 'Faster, hurry up!'/ Standing among them, I hear the supervisor bark.” He felt that “Once you’ve entered the workshop/ The only choice is submission,” and that his youth was coldly slipping away, so he could only “Watch it being ground away day and night/ Pressed, polished, molded/ Into a few measly bills, so-called wages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first Xu Lizhi found it difficult to adapt to the constant switching between dayshifts and nightshifts. In another poem, he described himself by the assembly line “standing straight like iron, hands like flight,” “How many days, how many nights/ Did I – just like that – standing, fall asleep?” He described his working life as exhausting, “Flowing through my veins, finally reaching the tip of my pen/ Taking root in the paper/ These words can be read only by the hearts of migrant workers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu once said that he never showed his poetry to his parents or other relatives, &quot;because it's something painful; I don't want them to see that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Failed efforts to get a job related to books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;　&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Xu lived in Shenzhen for only a few years, he identified deeply with the city. &quot;Everyone wishes they could put down roots in the city,&quot; he explained, but most migrant-worker [&lt;span&gt;dagong&lt;/span&gt;] poets write for a few years and then return to the countryside, get married and have children; Xu hoped to avoid that fate. He tried setting up a street stall with a friend, but failed. He also tried transferring from the assembly line to a logistics position, where he would have more freedom. He understood that very few such poets could get out [走出来]: &quot;[we] have to constantly fight for our lives [为生活奔波]; it's hard to go any further than that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February of this year, Xu quit his job at Foxconn and moved to Suzhou, Jiangsu. His friend explained that Xu's girlfriend worked there, but apparently things did not go well for Xu in Jiangsu. He told Zheng that he had trouble finding a job, but he did not go into detail about what happened there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a year later, he moved back to Shenzhen. In an earlier interview, Xu had said that he loved this city, that he derived great pleasure from its Central Book Mall and public libraries. If he were to return home [to rural Jieyang], there were only a few small bookstores, and &quot;even if I tried to order books online, they couldn't be delivered&quot; [to his remote address].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to his love of books, the first job application he submitted upon his return to Shenzhen in early September was to the Central Book Mall. Zheng recalled that Xu had told him, while working at Foxconn, that his dream was to become a librarian. Unfortunately, he did not get the job, and Zheng thinks this was a major disappointment. Two years earlier, Xu had applied for a position as librarian at Foxconn's internal library for employees, in response to a call for applications, and Xu had been turned down then as well. {...}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Returning to the workshop for one day prior to the incident&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu was running out of money, so after these disappointments, he returned to Foxconn, beginning work on September 29, in the same workshop where he had worked before. This should have been a new beginning, but it was not. That evening he mentioned to Zheng via online chat that someone had found him another job, so he might leave Foxconn again, but Zheng did not consider this anything special, figuring that Xu would not leave very soon, having just resumed work at Foxconn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Zheng heard of Xu was two days later, when people forwarded the news of Xu's suicide on WeChat. Zheng could not believe it: &quot;Hadn't we just chatted two nights ago?&quot; Later Zheng learned that Xu had committed suicide only the morning after they had chatted, not two days later as the media had reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Refuting online rumors that Xu was an orphan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Although it has been 10 days since Xu's death,] when it is mentioned, Zheng still cannot bear the grief. He thinks that Xu's suicide resulted from both internal and external factors: not only the disappointments he had undergone, but even more so the solitary poetic spirit in his bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Xu's passing, some online obituaries claimed that as a young child he had been orphaned, neglected and insulted until a poor old women adopted and raised him, and that this foster-grandmother had died a few years ago, leaving Xu alone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zheng [refuted these rumors, pointing out that] Xu's writings often mentioned his mother and homesickness. His second poem published in &lt;span&gt;Foxconn People&lt;/span&gt; [for example], was called &quot;Summertime Homesickness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu's poetry is cold and pensive, directly facing a life of misery. His poems trace a trajectory in which the scent of death becomes more and more pronounced. He had already rehearsed death hundreds of times in his writing, so the final act was merely a small step over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Selected Poems by Xu Lizhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《冲突》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Conflict&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们都说&lt;br /&gt;They all say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我是个话很少的孩子&lt;br /&gt;I'm a child of few words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对此我并不否认&lt;br /&gt;This I don't deny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实际上&lt;br /&gt;But actually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我说与不说&lt;br /&gt;Whether I speak or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;都会跟这个社会&lt;br /&gt;With this society I'll still&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;发生冲突&lt;br /&gt;Conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 7 June 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《我就那样站着入睡》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I Fall Asleep, Just Standing Like That&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;眼前的纸张微微发黄&lt;br /&gt;The paper before my eyes fades yellow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我用钢笔在上面凿下深浅不一的黑&lt;br /&gt;With a steel pen I chisel on it uneven black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;里面盛满打工的词汇&lt;br /&gt;Full of working words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;车间，流水线，机台，上岗证，加班，薪水……&lt;br /&gt;Workshop, assembly line, machine, work card, overtime, wages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我被它们治得服服贴贴&lt;br /&gt;They've trained me to become docile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不会呐喊，不会反抗&lt;br /&gt;Don't know how to shout or rebel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不会控诉，不会埋怨&lt;br /&gt;How to complain or denounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只默默地承受着疲惫&lt;br /&gt;Only how to silently suffer exhaustion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;驻足时光之初&lt;br /&gt;When I first set foot in this place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我只盼望每月十号那张灰色的薪资单&lt;br /&gt;I hoped only for that grey pay slip on the tenth of each month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;赐我以迟到的安慰&lt;br /&gt;To grant me some belated solace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此我必须磨去棱角，磨去语言&lt;br /&gt;For this I had to grind away my corners, grind away my words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拒绝旷工，拒绝病假，拒绝事假&lt;br /&gt;Refuse to skip work, refuse sick leave, refuse leave for private reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拒绝迟到，拒绝早退&lt;br /&gt;Refuse to be late, refuse to leave early&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流水线旁我站立如铁，双手如飞&lt;br /&gt;By the assembly line I stood straight like iron, hands like flight,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;多少白天，多少黑夜&lt;br /&gt;How many days, how many nights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我就那样，站着入睡&lt;br /&gt;Did I - just like that - standing fall asleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 20 August 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《一颗螺丝掉在地上》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;A Screw Fell to the Ground&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一颗螺丝掉在地上&lt;br /&gt;A screw fell to the ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在这个加班的夜晚&lt;br /&gt;In this dark night of overtime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;垂直降落，轻轻一响&lt;br /&gt;Plunging vertically, lightly clinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不会引起任何人的注意&lt;br /&gt;It won’t attract anyone’s attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就像在此之前&lt;br /&gt;Just like last time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;某个相同的夜晚&lt;br /&gt;On a night like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有个人掉在地上&lt;br /&gt;When someone plunged to the ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 9 January 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《谶言一种》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;A Kind of Prophecy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;村里的老人都说&lt;br /&gt;Village elders say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我跟我爷爷年轻时很像&lt;br /&gt;I resemble my grandfather in his youth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;刚开始我不以为然&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t recognize it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来经他们一再提起&lt;br /&gt;But listening to them time and again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我就深信不疑了&lt;br /&gt;Won me over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我跟我爷爷&lt;br /&gt;My grandfather and I share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不仅外貌越看越像&lt;br /&gt;Facial expressions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就连脾性和爱好&lt;br /&gt;Temperaments, hobbies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也像同一个娘胎里出来的&lt;br /&gt;Almost as if we came from the same womb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如我爷爷外号竹竿&lt;br /&gt;They nicknamed him “bamboo pole”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我外号衣架&lt;br /&gt;And me, “clothes hanger”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我爷爷经常忍气吞声&lt;br /&gt;He often swallowed his feelings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我经常唯唯诺诺&lt;br /&gt;I'm often obsequious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我爷爷喜欢猜谜&lt;br /&gt;He liked guessing riddles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我喜欢预言&lt;br /&gt;I like premonitions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1943年秋，鬼子进&lt;br /&gt;In the autumn of 1943, the Japanese devils invaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我爷爷被活活烧死&lt;br /&gt;and burned my grandfather alive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;享年23岁&lt;br /&gt;at the age of 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我今年23岁&lt;br /&gt;This year i turn 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 18 June 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《最后的墓地》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The Last Graveyard&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;机台的鸣叫也打着瞌睡&lt;br /&gt;Even the machine is nodding off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;密封的车间贮藏疾病的铁&lt;br /&gt;Sealed workshops store diseased iron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;薪资隐藏在窗帘后面&lt;br /&gt;Wages concealed behind curtains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;仿似年轻打工者深埋于心底的爱情&lt;br /&gt;Like the love that young workers bury at the bottom of their hearts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没有时间开口，情感徒留灰尘&lt;br /&gt;With no time for expression, emotion crumbles into dust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们有着铁打的胃&lt;br /&gt;They have stomachs forged of iron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;盛满浓稠的硫酸，硝酸&lt;br /&gt;Full of thick acid, sulfuric and nitric&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;工业向他们收缴来不及流出的泪&lt;br /&gt;Industry captures their tears before they have the chance to fall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时辰走过，他们清醒全无&lt;br /&gt;Time flows by, their heads lost in fog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;产量压低了年龄，疼痛在日夜加班&lt;br /&gt;Output weighs down their age, pain works overtime day and night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还未老去的头晕潜伏生命&lt;br /&gt;In their lives, dizziness before their time is latent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;皮肤被治具强迫褪去&lt;br /&gt;The jig forces the skin to peel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺手镀上一层铝合金&lt;br /&gt;And while it's at it, plates on a layer of aluminum alloy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有人还在坚持着，有人含病离去&lt;br /&gt;Some still endure, while others are taken by illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在他们中间打盹，留守青春的&lt;br /&gt;I am dozing between them, guarding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后一块墓地&lt;br /&gt;The last graveyard of our youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 21 December 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《我一生中的路还远远没有走完》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;My Life’s Journey is Still Far from Complete&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是谁都没有料到的&lt;br /&gt;This is something no one expected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我一生中的路&lt;br /&gt;My life’s journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还远远没有走完&lt;br /&gt;Is far from over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就要倒在半路上了&lt;br /&gt;But now it's stalled at the halfway mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;类似的困境&lt;br /&gt;It’s not as if similar difficulties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前也不是没有&lt;br /&gt;Didn’t exist before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只是都不像这次&lt;br /&gt;But they didn’t come&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来得这么突然&lt;br /&gt;As suddenly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这么凶猛&lt;br /&gt;As ferociously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一再地挣扎&lt;br /&gt;Repeatedly struggle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;竟全是徒劳&lt;br /&gt;But all is futile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我比谁都渴望站起来&lt;br /&gt;I want to stand up more than anyone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可是我的腿不答应&lt;br /&gt;But my legs won’t cooperate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的胃不答应&lt;br /&gt;My stomach won’t cooperate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我全身的骨头都不答应&lt;br /&gt;All the bones of my body won’t cooperate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我只能这样平躺着&lt;br /&gt;I can only lie flat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在黑暗里一次次地发出&lt;br /&gt;In this darkness, sending out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;无声的求救信号&lt;br /&gt;A silent distress signal, again and again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再一次次地听到&lt;br /&gt;Only to hear, again and again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;绝望的回响&lt;br /&gt;The echo of desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 13 July 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《我咽下一枚铁做的月亮》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I Swallowed a Moon Made of Iron&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我咽下一枚铁做的月亮&lt;br /&gt;I swallowed a moon made of iron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们把它叫做螺丝&lt;br /&gt;They refer to it as a nail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我咽下这工业的废水，失业的订单&lt;br /&gt;I swallowed this industrial sewage, these unemployment documents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那些低于机台的青春早早夭亡&lt;br /&gt;Youth stooped at machines die before their time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我咽下奔波，咽下流离失所&lt;br /&gt;I swallowed the hustle and the destitution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咽下人行天桥，咽下长满水锈的生活&lt;br /&gt;Swallowed pedestrian bridges, life covered in rust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我再咽不下了&lt;br /&gt;I can't swallow any more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所有我曾经咽下的现在都从喉咙汹涌而出&lt;br /&gt;All that I've swallowed is now gushing out of my throat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在祖国的领土上铺成一首&lt;br /&gt;Unfurling on the land of my ancestors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;耻辱的诗&lt;br /&gt;Into a disgraceful poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 19 December 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《出租屋》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Rented Room&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十平米左右的空间&lt;br /&gt;A space of ten square meters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;局促，潮湿，终年不见天日&lt;br /&gt;Cramped and damp, no sunlight all year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在这里吃饭，睡觉，拉屎，思考&lt;br /&gt;Here I eat, sleep, shit, and think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咳嗽，偏头痛，生老，病不死&lt;br /&gt;Cough, get headaches, grow old, get sick but still fail to die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昏黄的灯光下我一再发呆，傻笑&lt;br /&gt;Under the dull yellow light again I stare blankly, chuckling like an idiot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来回踱步，低声唱歌，阅读，写诗&lt;br /&gt;I pace back and forth, singing softly, reading, writing poems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每当我打开窗户或者柴门&lt;br /&gt;Every time I open the window or the wicker gate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我都像一位死者&lt;br /&gt;I seem like a dead man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;把棺材盖，缓缓推开&lt;br /&gt;Slowly pushing open the lid of a coffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 2 December 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;《惊闻90后青工诗人许立志坠楼有感》&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Upon Hearing the News of Xu Lizhi's Suicide&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Zhou Qizao (周启早), a fellow worker at Foxconn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每一个生命的消失&lt;br /&gt;The loss of every life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;都是另一个我的离去&lt;br /&gt;Is the passing of another me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又一枚螺丝松动&lt;br /&gt;Another screw comes loose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又一位打工兄弟坠楼&lt;br /&gt;Another migrant worker brother jumps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你替我死去&lt;br /&gt;You die in place of me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我替你继续写诗&lt;br /&gt;And I keep writing in place of you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺便拧紧螺丝&lt;br /&gt;While I do so, screwing the screws tighter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天是祖国六十五岁的生日&lt;br /&gt;Today is our nation's sixty-fifth birthday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;举国欢庆&lt;br /&gt;We wish the country joyous celebrations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二十四岁的你立在灰色的镜框里微微含笑&lt;br /&gt;A twenty-four-year-old you stands in the grey picture frame, smiling ever so slightly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;秋风秋雨&lt;br /&gt;Autumn winds and autumn rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;白发苍苍的父亲捧着你黑色的骨灰盒趔趄还乡&lt;br /&gt;A white-haired father, holding the black urn with your ashes, stumbles home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 1 October 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Translators' notes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: WriteFreely – minimalist, federated blogging platform</title>
<link>https://writefreely.org</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://writefreely.org</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Create a minimalist blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WriteFreely is built around writing. There's no news feed, notifications, or unnecessary &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;claps&lt;/em&gt; to take you away from your train of thought. You get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://write.as/new&quot; target=&quot;editor&quot;&gt;distraction-free writing environment&lt;/a&gt;, and readers can enjoy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.writefreely.org/&quot; target=&quot;reading&quot;&gt;clean reading experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publish to the fediverse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach outside your own site with federation via ActivityPub. WriteFreely lets anyone on Mastodon, Pleroma, or any ActivityPub-enabled service follow your blog, bookmark your posts, and share them with their followers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://video.writeas.org/videos/watch/cc55e615-d204-417c-9575-7b57674cc6f3&quot; onclick=&quot;showDemo(); return false;&quot;&gt;See how it works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easy on the eyes (and your server)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WriteFreely is written in Go (golang), so it runs anywhere and takes up very few resources — you can even run it on a Raspberry Pi! Installation is as easy as uploading a binary (plus a few files, for now).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A web-based mission control framework by NASA</title>
<link>https://github.com/nasa/openmct</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/nasa/openmct</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open MCT (Open Mission Control Technologies) is a next-generation mission control framework for visualization of data on desktop and mobile devices. It is developed at NASA's Ames Research Center, and is being used by NASA for data analysis of spacecraft missions, as well as planning and operation of experimental rover systems. As a generalizable and open source framework, Open MCT could be used as the basis for building applications for planning, operation, and analysis of any systems producing telemetry data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Official Site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/getting-started/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See Open MCT in Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try Open MCT now with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmct-demo.herokuapp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/961f498817acbd8eb0faf207bb9dd41461a4988e/68747470733a2f2f6e6173612e6769746875622e696f2f6f70656e6d63742f7374617469632f7265732f696d616765732f4f70656e2d4d43542e42726f7773652e4c61796f75742e4d6172732d576561746865722d312e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/961f498817acbd8eb0faf207bb9dd41461a4988e/68747470733a2f2f6e6173612e6769746875622e696f2f6f70656e6d63742f7374617469632f7265732f696d616765732f4f70656e2d4d43542e42726f7773652e4c61796f75742e4d6172732d576561746865722d312e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Demo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/static/res/images/Open-MCT.Browse.Layout.Mars-Weather-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/docs/api/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;easier-to-use API&lt;/a&gt; has been added to Open MCT. Changes in this API include a move away from a declarative system of JSON configuration files towards an imperative system based on function calls. Developers will be able to extend and build on Open MCT by making direct function calls to a public API. Open MCT is also being refactored to minimize the dependencies that using Open MCT imposes on developers, such as the current requirement to use AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want Open MCT to be as easy to use, install, run, and develop for as possible, and your feedback will help us get there! Feedback can be provided via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt;, or by emailing us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:arc-dl-openmct@mail.nasa.gov&quot;&gt;arc-dl-openmct@mail.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building and Running Open MCT Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and running Open MCT in your local dev environment is very easy. Be sure you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; installed, then follow the directions below. Need additional information? Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/getting-started/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt; page on our website. (These instructions assume you are installing as a non-root user; developers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues/1151&quot;&gt;reported issues&lt;/a&gt; running these steps with root privileges.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clone the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/nasa/openmct.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install development dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run a local development server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open MCT is now running, and can be accessed by pointing a web browser at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nasa.github.io/openmct/documentation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open MCT website&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation can also be built locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearest examples for developing Open MCT plugins are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial&quot;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; provided in our documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a practical example of a telemetry adapter, see David Hudson's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hudsonfoo/kerbal-openmct&quot;&gt;Kerbal Space Program plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which allows &lt;a href=&quot;https://kerbalspaceprogram.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/a&gt; players to build and use displays for their own missions in Open MCT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional examples are available in the &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy of this repository; however, be aware that these examples are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/openmct/issues/846&quot;&gt;not fully-documented&lt;/a&gt;, so the tutorials will likely serve as a better starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building the Open MCT Documentation Locally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open MCT's documentation is generated by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;-based build. It has additional dependencies that may not be available on every platform and thus is not covered in the standard npm install. Ensure your system has &lt;a href=&quot;http://cairographics.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;libcairo&lt;/a&gt; installed and then run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install canvas nomnoml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentation will be generated in &lt;code&gt;target/docs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying Open MCT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open MCT is built using &lt;a href=&quot;http://npmjs.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gulp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build Open MCT for deployment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run prepare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will compile and minify JavaScript sources, as well as copy over assets. The contents of the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder will contain a runnable Open MCT instance (e.g. by starting an HTTP server in that directory), including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; file containing Open MCT source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various assets in the &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;platform&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; that runs Open MCT in its default configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;code&gt;gulp&lt;/code&gt; tasks are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/openmct/blob/master/gulpfile.js&quot;&gt;the gulpfile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bundles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bundle is a group of software components (including source code, declared as AMD modules, as well as resources such as images and HTML templates) that is intended to be added or removed as a single unit. A plug-in for Open MCT will be expressed as a bundle; platform components are also expressed as bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bundle is also just a directory which contains a file &lt;code&gt;bundle.json&lt;/code&gt;, which declares its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;bundles.json&lt;/code&gt; (note the plural), at the top level of the repository, is a JSON file containing an array of all bundles (expressed as directory names) to include in a running instance of Open MCT. Adding or removing paths from this list will add or remove bundles from the running application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests are written for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jasmine 1.3&lt;/a&gt; and run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://karma-runner.github.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Karma&lt;/a&gt;. To run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test suite is configured to load any scripts ending with &lt;code&gt;Spec.js&lt;/code&gt; found in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy. Full configuration details are found in &lt;code&gt;karma.conf.js&lt;/code&gt;. By convention, unit test scripts should be located alongside the units that they test; for example, &lt;code&gt;src/foo/Bar.js&lt;/code&gt; would be tested by &lt;code&gt;src/foo/BarSpec.js&lt;/code&gt;. (For legacy reasons, some existing tests may be located in separate &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; folders near the units they test, but the naming convention is otherwise the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test Reporting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; is run, test results will be written as HTML to &lt;code&gt;target/tests&lt;/code&gt;. Code coverage information is written to &lt;code&gt;target/coverage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain terms are used throughout Open MCT with consistent meanings or conventions. Any deviations from the below are issues and should be addressed (either by updating this glossary or changing code to reflect correct usage.) Other developer documentation, particularly in-line documentation, may presume an understanding of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bundle&lt;/em&gt;: A bundle is a removable, reusable grouping of software elements. The application is composed of bundles. Plug-ins are bundles. For more information, refer to framework documentation (under &lt;code&gt;platform/framework&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt;: An object which exposes dynamic behavior or non-persistent state associated with a domain object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt;: In the context of a domain object, this refers to the set of other domain objects that compose or are contained by that object. A domain object's composition is the set of domain objects that should appear immediately beneath it in a tree hierarchy. A domain object's composition is described in its model as an array of id's; its composition capability provides a means to retrieve the actual domain object instances associated with these identifiers asynchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt;: When used as an object property, this refers to the human-readable description of a thing; usually a single sentence or short paragraph. (Most often used in the context of extensions, domain object models, or other similar application-specific objects.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;domain object&lt;/em&gt;: A meaningful object to the user; a distinct thing in the work support by Open MCT. Anything that appears in the left-hand tree is a domain object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;extension&lt;/em&gt;: An extension is a unit of functionality exposed to the platform in a declarative fashion by a bundle. For more information, refer to framework documentation (under &lt;code&gt;platform/framework&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;: A string which uniquely identifies a domain object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt;: When used as an object property, this refers to the machine-readable identifier for a specific thing in a set of things. (Most often used in the context of extensions or other similar application-specific object sets.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;: The persistent state associated with a domain object. A domain object's model is a JavaScript object which can be converted to JSON without losing information (that is, it contains no methods.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;: When used as an object property, this refers to the human-readable name for a thing. (Most often used in the context of extensions, domain object models, or other similar application-specific objects.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;navigation&lt;/em&gt;: Refers to the current state of the application with respect to the user's expressed interest in a specific domain object; e.g. when a user clicks on a domain object in the tree, they are &lt;em&gt;navigating&lt;/em&gt; to it, and it is thereafter considered the &lt;em&gt;navigated&lt;/em&gt; object (until the user makes another such choice.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;: A name used to identify a persistence store. Interactions with persistence will generally involve a &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt; parameter in some form, to distinguish multiple persistence stores from one another (for cases where there are multiple valid persistence locations available.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>25 years ago today, NCSA Mosaic 1.0 was released</title>
<link>http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic/versions</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic/versions</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;mainh3&quot; class=&quot;dynamicTitle&quot;&gt;Mosaic versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the beginning there was NCSA Mosaic....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.1a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Development began in June 1993 - Internal testing Only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Native support for accessing documents and data using World Wide Web, gopher, Anonymous FTP, and NNTP (Usenet News) protocols. Support for archie, finger, whois, and Veronica (as well as others) through gateways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full HTML display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for inlined GIF images in HTML hypertext documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal sound support for Sun/NeXT/DEC .AU audio files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for GIF, JPEG, MPEG, QuickTime for Windows, Microsoft Video for Windows, Postcript and other documents via forking to appropriate viewers (user configurable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full hypertext support, including using inlined images as anchors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional toolbar with shortcut buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional status bar to display hyperlink destinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local History&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully customizable font selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savable preferences, including window size and position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal Hotlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrolling for large documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status of loading/decoding shown in status bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.2a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed some memory leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now works with Winsock 1.1 compliant DLLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local file support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User configurable hotlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add current document to hotlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.3a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug which would cause a GPF upon exiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a number of memory holes which would lead to GPF's and quickly running out of available resources. (although some probably still remain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary Transfer Mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for Inlined X-Bitmaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration option to automatically load a home page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User configurable menus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal support for AIFF audio files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug which would cause a crash if an inlined image was missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed strange bug which resulted 'y with quotation mark' characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ability to perform remote search (still has a bug...see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.4a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Null chunk bug has been fixed! You should no longer see Mosaic dropping parts of a document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems with anchors on left edge of the window have been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPF when choosing &quot;Add Current to Hotlist&quot; with no document loaded has been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchors in preformatted text now work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new line break tag (&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;) has been implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description lists display correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists can now be nested to arbitrary depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bold (&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;) and italics (&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;) tags now work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now try to load an image several times before we give up on it. This is actually a little annoying on documents that have missing images (such as some of the Vatican Exhibit docs), but I'm working on fixing that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosaic for Windows calls WSACleanup to clean up the sockets library. This may temporarily cause a problem for people using our library - Windows will give the message &quot;Application Error - Call to Undefined Dynalink&quot; when you try to exit. Don't worry about it. We'll get around to fixing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, the fix to the bug that was wiping out chunks of a document seems to have improved the GPF'ing. However, it still crashes every once in a while, and it still seems to be a much more frequent occurence in the non-debugging version of the program. *sigh*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.5a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Sept. 16, 1993&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Image cacheing within document - no more multiple loads of images when they are used multiple times in a document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MUCH&lt;/strong&gt; faster scrolling, due to smarter drawing function. &lt;em&gt;This introduced an as-yet-unfixed redrawing bug while scrolling in a document that has inlined images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seems to alleviated the problem with documents being visually mangled when loaded while not scrolled to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug with removing spaces in Gopher, News, and FTP is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal anchors - i.e., hyperlinks to anchors within a document - work now, complete with scrolling to the correct location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Typing (i.e. HTML vs plaintext) is done more intelligently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Page button and Menu option work now, loading whatever document is set up as &quot;URL0&quot; in WMOSAIC.INI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Local capability - use standard file dialog to open files on local disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag and Drop local file capability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag and Drop file to annotation window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image retry is smarter - knows when it failed to connect vs when server returned an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find/Find Next (searching within a document)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white strip that was showing up in the Fast and Error bitmaps when they were hyperlinks is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spaces are now stripped out at the beginning of list indices and paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.6b&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First beta release - September 28, 1993&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try out the brand-new &quot;Mail to Developers&quot; option under the Help menu!! This lets you send email to the developers straight from your PC. Be sure to set up your email address in WMOSAIC.INI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ISMAP image attribute is supported!! For a demo of this, take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/expo_map.html&quot;&gt;Expo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History Window is now fixed - &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Display Inlined Images&quot; option is now complete - shut this off to not transfer inlined images (lots faster for people running over a slow net connection). Press the left mouse button to traverse a hyperlink, press the right mouse button to load an unloaded inline image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new horizontal rule tag (&amp;lt;HR&amp;gt;) has been implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local directory browsing works now. Try &lt;a href=&quot;file:///c%7C/&quot;&gt;this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The messed-up MPEG and JPEG extensions are fixed, and configureable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options for changing anchor color and &lt;strong&gt;underlining anchors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely configureable MIME-style extension typing and presentation (See installation documentation for details.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive specifiers have been added to local file URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;DELETE : command not found&quot; error after loading GIF, etc., is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Annotations are much more robust now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrolling via keys is now supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISO characters should work now, if specified by the correct HTML, like so: &quot;Sein -- das ist der Paß für die Ewigkeit.&quot; (aus &lt;strong&gt;Die Grössere Hoffnung&lt;/strong&gt; von Ilse Aichinger.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 0.7b&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released October 17,1993&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A MAJOR memory drain is plugged... you can now use Mosaic for a LOOOOOONG time without running out of memory (hopefully!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOCUMENT caching is now supported! You can cache by number of documents (stable) or amount of memory (NOT stable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Search feature works again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Mosaic is now HTTP/1.0 compliant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If HTTP accesses didn't work for you, but Gopher and FTP did, it should now. (This was the case running under Windows NT.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail To Developers window now resizes correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SMTP/Mail host is now configureable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history is fixed - no more Assertion Failed messages from Back&amp;amp;Forward buttons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WinMosaic no longer attempts to MIME-type files transferred in binary mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URLs which contain IP numbers no longer cause GPFs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documents without titles no longer have the last document's title in the title bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background color can be set to white instead of grey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlining/anchor bug seen on the Mosaic demo page is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with menu items on Menu 8 being mapped to Menu 2 is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporary file names are chosen more intelligently (attempts to use the source file's name.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 1.0&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Nov 11, 1993&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scrolling bug is fixed. You shouldn't see the screen mess up due to images or large text in the document anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network I/O is now (somewhat) &lt;strong&gt;interruptable&lt;/strong&gt;. Click on the big Mosaic icon in the upper-right corner to kill a net transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, quitting Mosaic forces a kill of any net transfers in progress. This means the &quot;Can't run two instances of the same program&quot; error message shouldn't appear anymore (although this feature is still a bit buggy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images can now be alligned middle, top, or bottom, instead of just top. Considering that the default is bottom, and we only did top before, I was pretty surprised that no-one mentioned this anomaly throughout all our beta testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News articles are now readable (i.e., not all on one line.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL redirection (a feature of HTTP 1.0) is now supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Page loading is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were having problems with the first document you tried never loading, but subsequent ones working fine, that's fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title and URL boxes are redrawn at the correct time now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back &amp;amp; Forward Assertion Failed errors are gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telnet executable (used for telnet:// URLs) is now configureable - see &quot;telnet=&quot; under the Viewers section of the INI file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP error messages are now returned to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP logins now use your email address when logging in (this fixes a connect problem the CERN LibWWW was creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can log in to a NON-anonymous FTP via the following method: set the URL to be FILE://username@machine/pathname. For example, to log in as user &quot;jdoe&quot; to FTP site &quot;ftp.yoyodyne.com&quot;, in the &quot;/usr/jdoe&quot; directory, give the URL: &quot;file://jdoe@ftp.yoyodyne.com/usr/jdoe&quot; Mosaic will pop up a dialog box, asking to confirm the username and give your password. &lt;strong&gt;Your password is maintained within Mosaic until you quit. Do &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; use this feature if you are security-paranoid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gopher and FTP now use pretty icons for files/directories/etc, and FTP shows the file sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New set of Configured Menus, with all kinds of pointers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal rules are prettier now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0alpha1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Jan 31, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0alpha2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Feb 28, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Redirect bug fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiffy new hotlist/menu user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxy gateway support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS cacheing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faster GIF decoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URLs missing trailing slash (e.g. &quot;http://cs.indiana.edu&quot;) now have correct relative urls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several FORMs bugs fixed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released April 6, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bug with deeply nested tags fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;-i inifile&quot; command-line option for INI file location.
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;ie. mosaic -i c:/directory/mosaic.ini.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt; OPTION&amp;gt; tags won't crash Mosaic anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed bug with downloading files via FTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP slightly improved - now able to connect to ftp.microsoft.com, e.g.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt; em &amp;gt; and &amp;lt; strong &amp;gt; tags now supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt; dir &amp;gt; and &amp;lt; menu &amp;gt; tags are now more properly supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grey out back &amp;amp; forward when no current doc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen repaint from another window on top is occasionally wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen repaints get &quot;lost&quot; if busy fixed for 3.1 but still a problem with NT&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released April 14, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs Fixed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;News:URLs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Updating problems of the NCSA icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with view source on cached docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lost slash bug (the Temp files under Win31.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0alpha5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released June 24, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs Fixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were two large memory leaks which occurred whenever an inline image was decoded and displayed. These leaks were approx. 1,000 bytes each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The document view window was being drawn incorrectly whenever the user was at the bottom of a document, and Mosaic was re-sized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XBM images are now properly read and do not result in an ERROR graphic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XBM images used to require a LARGE amount of time to decode. The code was re-written and now .xbm's decode approximately 100 times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Printing bugs; large files, images, bold text, .txt files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some minor problems with dialog boxes were fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CRASH caused by incorrect HTML, &amp;lt; dt &amp;gt; and &amp;lt; dd &amp;gt; tags without the &amp;lt; dl &amp;gt; tag, was corrected. Mosaic is a little more forgiving, but not much. ;^)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The navigate back should now take you back to the last document viewed. Previously, Mosaic did not update the history when users accessed documents that were cached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is now possible to enter a URL directly to the Document URL line. Select the Document URL line, enter the URL and press return to open the desired URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Vertical Scroll Bar is currently a permanent fixture on the document view window. This eliminates an extra screen redraw which would occur whenever the user went from a short document (less than one screenful) to a long document or vice versa. Ideally we'd like the vertical scroll bar to be dynamic without the extra redraws, but this will improve things for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buttons on the button bar are now in color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;FIND&quot; button was redrawn with a more intuitive picture. It used to look like a thermometer and may have lead people to believe it was for the hotlist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0alpha 6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released July 27, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This latest release has focused on speed and memory issues. Our next release, alpha 7, will address many of the bugs which you have reported to us. The following bugs have been fixed in alpha 6:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loading of local URLs should no longer produce DNS Lookup failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loading of local images and sound files no longer deletes the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loading of images now shows the transfer progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A face lift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiosk Mosaic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional Help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0 alpha 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Sep 7, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Local files are no longer deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local files are no longer duplicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file:// = ftp:// (Alpha 6 locked file:// for local files and ftp:// for remote files. However, due to the large number of existing files that were written using the old definition of file://, we had to revert back to file:// = ftp://. Thus, file:///c| MUST be used to access local files.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image alignment problem. Inline images align horizontally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The -i option was fixed. (-i allows the user to use the mosaic.ini that is explicitly defined. ie. mosaic.exe -i c:\ncsa\mosaic.ini)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The save, save as function. Save and Save as will save the current document to your local disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animated Icon Change. We've changed the size of the icon to be relative to the amount of space that is available in the window. ie. If you use both the tool bar and the Show Current URL functions, you will have a full-size animated icon. If you choose not to use either of these functions, the icon will be reduced in size to fit in the available space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tool tips were added. Tool tips offers the user information about the current tool the mouse cursor is pointing at in the Tool bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The find icon on the Tool bar has changed from the list icon to a binocular icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've removed the &quot;URL&quot; title from the &quot;Show Current URL&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Version 2.0 Alpha 8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released Dec 20, 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features and Enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Simple Superscript - &amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt; OR &amp;lt;SUPER&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/SUPER&amp;gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Simple Subscript - &amp;lt;SUB&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/SUB&amp;gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The NCSA Mosaic logo has a new look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosaic will use the Temp directory as defined in your autoexec.bat file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way Mosaic displays data has improved significantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosaic is more forgiving about bad html. It shouldn't crash if it encounters bad html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms: input controls of TYPE=Image are supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anchor underline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All known printing bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color palette problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms:
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;White space is handled properly&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Mosaic will remember the fields on a form after you submit it.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mosaic is more lenient about the syntax of the menu item definitions in the &quot;mosaic.ini&quot; file. Bad syntax caused crashes on startup in Version 2Alpha8. :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosaic will no longer crash if you try to print a document with inline images when the &quot;Display Inline Image&quot; option is turned off.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>The Art Institute of Chicago Has Put 50k High-Res Images Online</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kottke.org/18/11/the-art-institute-of-chicago-has-put-50000-high-res-images-from-their-collection-online</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Art Institute of Chicago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/articles/713/behind-the-scenes-of-the-website-redesign&quot;&gt;recently unveiled a new website design&lt;/a&gt;. As part of their first design upgrade in 6 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/collection?is_public_domain=1&quot;&gt;they have placed more than 52,000 high-resolution images from their collection online&lt;/a&gt;, available to all comers without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students, educators, and just regular art lovers might be interested to learn that we’ve released thousands of images in the public domain on the new website in an open-access format (52,438 to be exact, and growing regularly). Made available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, these images can be downloaded for free on the artwork pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also enhanced the image viewing capabilities on object pages, which means that you can see much greater detail on objects than before. Check out the paint strokes in Van Gogh’s The Bedroom, the charcoal details on Charles White’s Harvest Talk, or the synaesthetic richness of Georgia O’Keeffe’s Blue and Green Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a few notable works from their collection above: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24645/under-the-wave-off-kanagawa-kanagawa-oki-nami-ura-also-known-as-the-great-wave-from-the-series-thirty-six-views-of-mount-fuji-fugaku-sanjurokkei&quot;&gt;The Great Wave&lt;/a&gt; by Katsushika Hokusai, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884&quot;&gt;A Sunday on La Grande Jatte&lt;/a&gt; by Georges Seurat (which you can zoom and pretend you’re Cameron in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80607/self-portrait&quot;&gt;Self-Portrait&lt;/a&gt; by Vincent van Gogh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks&quot;&gt;Nighthawks&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Hopper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47149/mao&quot;&gt;Mao&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Warhol, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14655/two-sisters-on-the-terrace&quot;&gt;Two Sisters (On the Terrace)&lt;/a&gt; by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The resolution on the images is high enough to check out the brushstrokes on the paintings. Here’s some detail on the van Gogh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/art-institute-chi-07.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Art Institute Chicago&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love seeing more museums doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
