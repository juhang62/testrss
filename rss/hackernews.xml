                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Vasileios Vasileiou next to the bed he hid inside while Taliban gunmen operated from his room&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17CA9/production/_105194479_img-20181206-wa0000.jpg&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;649&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Just over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul. The Intercontinental was popular with foreign visitors - which is why, on 20 January, Taliban gunmen stormed it, killing at least 40 people. Vasileios explains how he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had decided to go for dinner early - at six o'clock - with my friend, another pilot called Michael Poulikakos. It was the first time in the three or four months that I had been coming to the Intercontinental that I'd done this - usually I had dinner at around 8.30pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Vasileios Vasileiou and Michael Poulikakos worked for Afghan airline Kam Air
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We finished dinner about 7.30pm and then I went up to my room - room 522 - on the top floor, to make some calls. At 8.47pm I was on the phone to Athens when I heard a big explosion down in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went out on to the balcony. I could see a man on the ground covered in blood and I could hear gunfire coming from inside and outside the hotel. I realised how lucky it was that I wasn't in the restaurant at that moment and said to myself, &quot;OK Vasileios, you have to do something in order to survive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the balcony door open and locked the door to my room. There were two beds in my suite so I took one of the mattresses and put it against the door to protect myself from grenades, and then I gathered some bed sheets, towels and clothes and made a rope that I could use to get to the fourth floor if I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I'm a pilot and a trainer I've studied crisis management and decision-making for years, so even if I'm only going to a restaurant or to the theatre I think about sitting by the door, or close to the emergency exit - it's automatic, almost second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about what I was going to do next. I had no idea how many attackers there were or where they were in the building, and jumping from the fifth floor wasn't wise, so I said to myself, &quot;Vasileios, stay inside and try to do as much as possible to protect yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason I can't really explain, I was unexpectedly calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the bed with the mattress on it look a little bit untidy, and the other one - the one I had removed the mattress from - look tidy. I turned off the light and decided to hide behind the heavy curtains and furniture in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About an hour-and-a-half passed, and although I didn't know it at the time the attackers had by now killed almost everyone in the lobby, the restaurant, and on the first and second floors of the hotel. They had rushed through the third and fourth floors to the fifth floor and I could hear them running around on the rooftop above my head, where they were managing to keep away helicopters belonging to the international forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard gunfire in the corridor nearby and suddenly all the electricity in the hotel went off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The end of the corridor, near the lifts, where the gunmen entered the fifth floor
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first room on the fifth floor that the attackers went into was room 521, the room next to mine, which became their operational centre for the duration of the overnight siege. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard guns being fired into the door to my room and I thought to myself, &quot;This is not a good position to be in.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got on to the floor and went underneath the bed that still had a mattress on it to try to protect myself. I was holding this single bed up with my fists and the tip of my toes, supporting the weight of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could see a little, because the bed was elevated about 10cm into the air. They shot through the lock, hit the door with a heavy hammer and then four men came into my room. One immediately ran to the balcony because he saw that the door was open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard gunfire from a pistol, one shot, and I thought that in the next few seconds I was probably going to die. I thought about my family, the faces of my children, and the good and bad moments in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door was left open and the gunmen were coming in and out all the time. Then they started opening other doors on the fifth floor. Just across the corridor from me was an air steward and some other pilots that I'd worked with. Sometimes I would hear their cries before they were executed. Sometimes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they opened every single door on the fifth floor and killed everyone that they found. I'd hear the cries, hear the bullet - just one bullet - and then they'd crash through the next door. Each time they would laugh afterwards, like they were just playing around, or like it was a big party or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around three o'clock in the morning, they started a big fire on the fifth floor and then left because the smoke was so heavy. For 20-25 minutes there was no gunfire, so I decided to come out from underneath the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I came out, I realised that while I had been hiding underneath one of the two beds they had shot at the other bed and then lifted up its wooden base to look for anyone who might be hiding there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought, &quot;This is the second time today that I have escaped with my life.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Vasileios's room, number 522: He describes how he hid from his attackers when they burst in&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, smoke began coming into my room. I had to do something, so I went out on to the balcony. I could see the fire on my left hand side, it was heavy and I realised that if it reached my room I wasn't going to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw some TV cables hanging from the roof, going straight down to the ground. I stretched to grab them to see if they could support my weight and I could use them to slip down, but just at that moment I heard bullets passing right next to me. One bullet passed about 20cm from my left shoulder and another about half a metre away. They left two holes in the window glass right behind me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Find out more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasileios Vasileiou spoke to &lt;strong&gt;Outlook&lt;/strong&gt; on the BBC World Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswldt&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;listen again here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably a sniper belonging to the international forces who'd seen me through night vision cameras coming out of room 522 and assumed that I was one of the bad guys. Snipers never miss at that distance, but in the split second that they'd fired I'd moved my body to grab the cables, and the bullets had just missed me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to go inside. I went to the bathroom - very, very slowly, so as not to make a noise. I had some nail scissors among my things and I took them, went back underneath the bed and, using the small scissors, opened a hole in the plastic material which covered the underside of the bed's wooden base. There was just enough room for me to crawl inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took two bottles of water and some milk from the little fridge in my room and a T-shirt. I cut the T-shirt into small pieces and put some inside my nose to filter the smoke. I put another piece of the T-shirt around my mouth and put lots of milk and water on it, like a double filter, something I'd learned from training with the fire department at Athens International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Room 520 is to the right, followed by 521, then Vasileios's room, 522
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost as soon as I was inside the bed they were back. One of the guys came and sat on the bed that I was inside. I could see his feet and he kept spitting on the floor. He was giving orders to the other guys, telling them what to do, and I still remember his voice. Then he went to the bathroom, and after that he went on to the balcony and fired a few AK-47 magazines. I couldn't risk making any noise at all because when the gunfire stopped there was complete silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment something in my brain told me that I wasn't going to die that day. I had survived when I hadn't gone for dinner at my usual time. I had survived when those guys first came into my room and had shot at the other bed, not the one that I was underneath. I had survived when the sniper's bullets had missed me. And right now I was well hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought that the international forces would take over somehow, so I decided that if I just stayed where I was and did nothing, I'd be OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But early in the morning the international forces began to fire from a tank into the rooms. They concentrated on room 521, the one next door to me, but also fired at some of the other rooms, because the gunmen were moving around and firing at them from other places too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time the heavy guns on the tank fired the whole hotel shook. Later I saw the damage that they had done - all of the furniture had been turned to dust and holes had been opened in the ceilings. Again I felt lucky to still be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Room 520 - two doors down from Vasileios - after the attack
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started a second fire about six o'clock in the morning, right outside my room. I had heard the guys collecting some of the clothes from my closet, then they took the carpets and poured a lot of diesel on them. They burned their room - room 521 - too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire was very close to me and I knew that in the heavy smoke and heat I would only be able to survive for 15-20 minutes, maybe half an hour maximum. I was breathing from the floor to get the last oxygen from the heavy cold air coming into my room from the open balcony door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smoke didn't smell like the usual smell that you get from fires of wood or carpets. It was not a good smell. It was the smell of human bodies burning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I couldn't hear anyone around, I decided that I'd come out. But as I emerged, I suddenly heard the sound of breaking windows. It was coming from room 521 but then the same thing began happening in my room and I had to try to protect myself very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international forces outside were firing pressurised jets of water into the rooms to extinguish the flames and these were shattering the windows. The fire was quickly put out but I was now soaked to the skin in cold water in a room without windows or doors, on a cold Kabul night, when the outside temperature was about -3C. I would soon be suffering from hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Vasileios considered escaping via this emergency staircase in the early stages of the attack - but luckily decided against it
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 9.25am I heard gunfire coming from down the corridor near the elevators - it sounded different, so I guessed that it must be the international forces. A gunman in room 521 was answering that gunfire with a Kalashnikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 9.30am and 11.15am the international forces were throwing numerous grenades, I would hear them rolling across the floor. Sometimes they landed in room 521 and sometimes they exploded outside the open door of my room. I still have a flight case that was dented by one of those grenades, which I've kept as a kind of souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By about 11.30am there seemed to be only one gunman left near me - the man in room 521. I heard his gunfire switch from a Kalashnikov to a pistol. He was out of ammunition. Then he tried to set a new fire using a blowtorch, but soon was out of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Room 521's balcony, following the attack
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was so excited and full of adrenaline that I put my hand over my mouth in case I started laughing. He disappeared after a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was so tired. I'd had to fly late the night before all of this began, then hadn't slept the day or night previously, so I'd been awake for more than 35 or 40 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much later I began to hear other noises and people walking towards my room but I couldn't see if it was the bad guys or the good guys. Around 11.40am somebody called out, &quot;Police! Police!&quot; in an Afghan accent, but I decided not to come out in case it was the bad guys. Then after 10 or 20 seconds I heard some people with English accents also shouting, &quot;Police!&quot; and I was so happy that I began yelling and crawling out of the bed. It was difficult to get out and I could barely breathe - my chest was hurting so much from being inside the bed, in one position, for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was black with smoke so they couldn't see my face and the four commandos were shouting, &quot;Stay down! Stay down!&quot; while pointing their guns at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them whispered: &quot;This must be a ghost!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was freezing cold but managed to say, &quot;I'm the captain from Kam Air. Please, don't shoot!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They couldn't believe what they were seeing. They asked me how many hours I'd been there. I told them I'd been there all the time. They looked at the bed and asked me how I had managed to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them said to me, &quot;OK, I'm gonna take you down, but listen, I have to have a photo with you before we go,&quot; and I said I'd like to have a photo to remember that moment too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Vasileios was given a battery-powered blanket to raise his body temperature
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the last to come out of the hotel. They took all of the survivors to the British base in Kabul. As soon as I saw my colleague Michael there I was so happy, I couldn't believe it. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. But there were mixed feelings. We had lost so many friends - so many people that we used to work with - pilots, operational personnel, engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry for Foreign Affairs had told my family that they had evacuated all the survivors from the hotel, but that they hadn't found me, so my family thought I hadn't made it. You can't imagine their happiness when three or four hours later I called them and told them that I was OK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Parts of the hotel were able to re-open two months after the attack
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always been a positive person, but nowadays I am even more so. I enjoy every single moment of life and feel grateful for what I have. Life is a gift and we should enjoy it for as long as it lasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, sitting on the beach in Greece with friends I've heard people complaining that because we had a financial crisis they miss some of the comforts they used to have. I am like, &quot;Come on! Enjoy your life and health. You are eating sardines and drinking Ouzo by the beach. We are free, we have good friends around and we laugh - this is what people are supposed to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't concentrate only on work, stressful and bad things in your life. Concentrate instead on creating good moments and being around good people, because life is so beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really realise that after Kabul - life is extremely beautiful. And, believe me, I enjoy every moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least 40 people died as a result of the Intercontinental Hotel attack. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All photographs courtesy of Vasileios Vasileiou, unless otherwise indicated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;You may also be interested in:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2014 two divers died at a depth of more than 100m in a huge cave system in Norway.

<title>Why does APT not use HTTPS?</title>
<link>https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS is used to prevent intruders from being able to listen to communications between you and websites you visit, as well as to avoid data being modified without your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, files obtained by APT are accompanied by their own signature which allows your system to check they originated from your distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These signatures are checked against a small set of trusted keys already stored on your computer. Downloaded files are rejected by APT if they are signed by an unknown key&lt;sup class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/#footnote-apt-unknown-key&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or are missing valid signatures. This ensures that the packages you are installing were authorised by your distribution and have not been modified or replaced since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS can not detect if malicious tampering has occurred on the disks of the server you are downloading from. There is little point &quot;securely&quot; transfering a compromised package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;But what about privacy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS does not provide meaningful privacy for obtaining packages. As an eavesdropper can usually see which hosts you are contacting, if you connect to your distribution's mirror network it would be fairly obvious that you are downloading updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even over an encrypted connection it is not difficult to figure out which files you are downloading based on the size of the transfer&lt;sup class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/#footnote-tor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. HTTPS would therefore only be useful for downloading from a server that also offers other packages of similar or identical size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more important is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that your connection is encrypted but that the files you are installing haven't been modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Overly trusting CAs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 400 &quot;Certificate Authorities&quot; who may issue certificates for any domain. Many have poor security records and some are even explicitly controlled by governments&lt;sup class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/#footnote-ca&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that HTTPS provides little-to-no protection against a targeted attack on your distribution's mirror network. You could limit the set of valid certificates that APT would accept, but that would be be error-prone and unlikely worth the additional hassle over the existing public-key scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Why not provide HTTPS anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your distribution could cryptographically sign the files using the existing scheme and additionally serve the files over HTTPS to provide &quot;defense in depth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, providing a huge worldwide mirror network available over SSL is not only a complicated engineering task (requiring the secure exchange and storage of private keys), it implies a misleading level of security and privacy to end-users as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A switch to HTTPS would also mean you could not take advantage of local proxy servers for speeding up access and would additionally prohibit many kinds of peer-to-peer mirroring where files are stored on servers not controlled directly by your distribution. This would disproportionately affect users in remote locales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Ah, what about replay attacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue with a naïve signing mechanism is that it does not guarantee that you are seeing the most up-to-date version of the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to a &lt;em&gt;replay attack&lt;/em&gt; where an attacker substitutes an archive with an earlier—unmodified—version of the archive. This would prevent APT from noticing new security updates which they could then exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this problem, APT archives includes a timestamp after which all the files are considered stale&lt;sup class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/#footnote-valid-until&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Where can I find out more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More technical details may be found on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt&quot;&gt;SecureAPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>H&amp;R Block and Intuit Lobby Against Free and Simple Tax Filing (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s how preparing your taxes could work: You sit down, review a prefilled filing from the government. If it’s accurate, you sign it. If it’s not, you fix it or ignore it altogether and prepare your return yourself. It’s your choice. You might not have to pay for an accountant, or fiddle for hours with complex software. It could all be over in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already like that in parts of Europe. And it would not be particularly difficult to give U.S. taxpayers the same option. After all, the government already gets earnings information from employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as ProPublica has detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, Intuit — the makers of TurboTax — and H&amp;amp;R Block have lobbied for years to derail any move toward such a system. And they continued in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000026667&quot;&gt;more than $2 million&lt;/a&gt; lobbying last year, much of it spent on legislation that would permanently bar the government from offering taxpayers prefilled returns. H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;spent $3 million&lt;/a&gt;, also directing some of their efforts towards the bill. Among the 60 co-sponsors of the bipartisan bill: then congressman and now Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, called the Free File Act of 2016, looks on the surface to be consumer-friendly. It makes permanent a public-private partnership in which 13 private tax preparation companies — called the “Free File Alliance” — have offered free online tax filings to lower- and middle-income families. The Free File Alliance include both Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the legislation would also permanently bar the IRS from offering its own free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit has repeatedly warned investors about the prospect of government-prepared returns. “We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,” Intuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000896878/3951ce1d-50d0-40fb-af50-f3d51d410b6e.pdf&quot;&gt;said in its latest corporate filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered a bill last year that would have actually allowed the government to start offering prefill tax returns. While Intuit did not lobby against Warren’s bill — presumably because the legislation had little chance of success — tax giant H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. (H&amp;amp;R Block did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Warren’s bill nor the Free File Act made it out of committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few of those eligible for the industry’s no-charge filing program actually use it, perhaps because the system is confusing and pushes people toward paid products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Free File Alliance says 70 percent of U.S. taxpayers can use the service, less than 2 percent of all individual tax returns were filed through the program in last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2016-ARC/ARC16_Volume1.pdf&quot;&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; a National Taxpayer Advocate’s report to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s call the so-called Free File Alliance what it really is — a front for tax prep companies who use it as a gateway to sell expensive products no one would even need if we’d just made it easier for people to pay their taxes,” said Warren in a statement to ProPublica. Warren’s office put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Tax_Maze_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the issue last year that repeatedly cited our coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement the Free File Alliance’s executive director, Tim Hugo, said that the alliance does not automatically push paid products to those that use the Free File program but the taxpayer does “have the option of ‘opting in’ to receive additional information and offers from the tax preparation company they have selected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the lack of awareness of the program is “unfortunate,” and placed blame on the IRS. While the tax agency previously had a large budget to advertise the Free File program, “today that budget is $0, making it difficult to reach the general public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Warren’s bill, the Free File Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freefilealliance.org/news/press-releases/free-file-program-tax-filing-simplification-act-would-create-a-conflict-of-interest-end-a-free-program-that-s-working-for-taxpayers/&quot;&gt;warned in press release&lt;/a&gt; that allowing the IRS to prep returns would create “a tremendous and potentially harmful conflict of interest for the American people by enshrining the roles of tax preparer, tax collector, tax auditor and tax enforcer in one entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo is also a state legislator in Virginia, which canceled its own cost-free system of tax filing in 2010 and replaced it with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB1349&quot;&gt;“Free File” bill&lt;/a&gt; connecting taxpayers to private companies. Hugo serves on the committee that greenlighted the legislation. Hugo said he saw no conflict of interest here, as the Free File program he represents is federal, not state, and he recused himself from voting in the committee and on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Bankman, a law professor in tax law at Stanford Law School said arguments about government overreach are false. Participation is voluntary and actually gives taxpayers the upper hand, forcing the government to “show its hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you know what the government knows,” Bankman said, who added that there are multiple ways taxpayers could benefit. “If there’s a mistake that goes in your favor, maybe you don’t call attention to it.” Also, everyone would receive the returns — including the millions of Americans who are due tax refunds but don’t get them because they don’t file. In 2012 alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-has-refunds-totaling-950-million-dollars-for-people-who-have-not-filed-a-2012-federal-income-tax-return&quot;&gt;the IRS said&lt;/a&gt; more than 1 million Americans did not receive their refunds — amounting to $950 million — because they did not file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the federal Free File bill have repeatedly voiced fears of big-government interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;7.1936758893281&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuit, producer of the top-selling tax software, has opposed letting the government do your taxes for free — even though it could save time and headaches for millions of filers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece for The Daily Caller and &lt;a href=&quot;https://roskam.house.gov/media-center/speeches/its-time-to-codify-the-free-file-program&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said “making the tax collector also the tax preparer creates an inherent conflict of interest while forcing citizens to relinquish control of their taxes to the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 election cycle, Roskam &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $32,000 in donations from Intuit’s political action committee and Intuit employees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; a far smaller amount, $2,500, from H&amp;amp;R Block — all for the 2016 election cycle. Roskam’s office did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Price &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;received only modest donations&lt;/a&gt; from Intuit, $3,500 since 2008 — $2,500 of which came six days after the Free File Act of 2016 was announced. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $2,000 total from H&amp;amp;R Block. (Price’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill’s Democrat co-author, Ron Kind, from Wisconsin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2002%2C2004%2C2006%2C2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=a&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $29,000 from Intuit and its employees since 2008. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $3,000 from H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Kind said he is “open to working with anyone” to find ways for “hardworking Wisconsin families” to file their taxes with ease. “At the same time, I want to make sure that Wisconsinites can access programs, like Free File, that they have come to depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for details on how many Wisconsinites actually rely on the program, given that few of those who qualify for it actually use it, a spokesperson for Kind did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NumPy 1.16 is the last release to support Python 2.7</title>
<link>https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This NumPy release is the last one to support Python 2.7 and will be maintained as a long term release with bug fixes until 2020. Support for Python 3.4 been dropped, the supported Python versions are 2.7 and 3.5-3.7. The wheels on PyPI are linked with OpenBLAS v0.3.4+, which should fix the known threading issues found in previous OpenBLAS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downstream developers building this release should use Cython &amp;gt;= 0.29 and, if using OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS &amp;gt; v0.3.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has seen a lot of refactoring and features many bug fixes, improved code organization, and better cross platform compatibility. Not all of these improvements will be visible to users, but they should help make maintenance easier going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experimental (opt-in only) support for overriding numpy functions, see &lt;code&gt;__array_function__&lt;/code&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; function is now a ufunc. This provides better performance and allows overriding with &lt;code&gt;__array_ufunc__&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved support for the ARM and POWER architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved support for AIX and PyPy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved interop with ctypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved support for PEP 3118.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New functions added to the numpy.lib.recfuntions module to ease the structured assignment changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;assign_fields_by_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;structured_to_unstructured&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unstructured_to_structured&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apply_along_fields&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;require_fields&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the user guide at &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New deprecations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The type dictionaries numpy.core.typeNA and numpy.core.sctypeNA are deprecated. They were buggy and not documented and will be removed in the 1.18 release. Use`numpy.sctypeDict` instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The numpy.asscalar function is deprecated. It is an alias to the more powerful numpy.ndarray.item, not tested, and fails for scalars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The numpy.set_array_ops and numpy.get_array_ops functions are deprecated. As part of NEP 15, they have been deprecated along with the C-API functions &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst#id1&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;user-content-id2&quot;&gt;:c:func:`PyArray_SetNumericOps`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst#id3&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;user-content-id4&quot;&gt;:c:func:`PyArray_GetNumericOps`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Users who wish to override the inner loop functions in built-in ufuncs should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst#id5&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;user-content-id6&quot;&gt;:c:func:`PyUFunc_ReplaceLoopBySignature`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The numpy.unravel_index keyword argument &lt;code&gt;dims&lt;/code&gt; is deprecated, use &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The numpy.histogram &lt;code&gt;normed&lt;/code&gt; argument is deprecated. It was deprecated previously, but no warning was issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;positive&lt;/code&gt; operator (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;) applied to non-numerical arrays is deprecated. See below for details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing an iterator to the stack functions is deprecated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expired deprecations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NaT comparisons now return &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; without a warning, finishing a deprecation cycle begun in NumPy 1.11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.lib.function_base.unique&lt;/code&gt; was removed, finishing a deprecation cycle begun in NumPy 1.4. Use numpy.unique instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-field indexing now returns views instead of copies, finishing a deprecation cycle begun in NumPy 1.7. The change was previously attempted in NumPy 1.14 but reverted until now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.PackageLoader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;np.pkgload&lt;/code&gt; have been removed. These were deprecated in 1.10, had no tests, and seem to no longer work in 1.15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NumPy 1.17 will drop support for Python 2.7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;f2py script on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, the installed script for running f2py is now an &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; file rather than a &lt;code&gt;*.py&lt;/code&gt; file and should be run from the command line as &lt;code&gt;f2py&lt;/code&gt; whenever the &lt;code&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt; directory is in the path. Running &lt;code&gt;f2py&lt;/code&gt; as a module &lt;code&gt;python -m numpy.f2py [...]&lt;/code&gt; will work without path modification in any version of NumPy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;NaT comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the behavior of NaN, all comparisons other than inequality checks with datetime64 or timedelta64 NaT (&quot;not-a-time&quot;) values now always return &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, and inequality checks with NaT now always return &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. This includes comparisons beteween NaT values. For compatibility with the old behavior, use &lt;code&gt;np.isnat&lt;/code&gt; to explicitly check for NaT or convert datetime64/timedelta64 arrays with &lt;code&gt;.astype(np.int64)&lt;/code&gt; before making comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;complex64/128 alignment has changed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory alignment of complex types is now the same as a C-struct composed of two floating point values, while before it was equal to the size of the type. For many users (for instance on x64/unix/gcc) this means that complex64 is now 4-byte aligned instead of 8-byte aligned. An important consequence is that aligned structured dtypes may now have a different size. For instance, &lt;code&gt;np.dtype('c8,u1', align=True)&lt;/code&gt; used to have an itemsize of 16 (on x64/gcc) but now it is 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More in detail, the complex64 type now has the same alignment as a C-struct &lt;code&gt;struct {float r, i;}&lt;/code&gt;, according to the compiler used to compile numpy, and similarly for the complex128 and complex256 types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;nd_grid __len__ removal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;len(np.mgrid)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;len(np.ogrid)&lt;/code&gt; are now considered nonsensical and raise a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.unravel_index&lt;/code&gt; now accepts &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; keyword argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, only the &lt;code&gt;dims&lt;/code&gt; keyword argument was accepted for specification of the shape of the array to be used for unraveling. &lt;code&gt;dims&lt;/code&gt; remains supported, but is now deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;multi-field views return a view instead of a copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexing a structured array with multiple fields, e.g., &lt;code&gt;arr[['f1', 'f3']]&lt;/code&gt;, returns a view into the original array instead of a copy. The returned view will often have extra padding bytes corresponding to intervening fields in the original array, unlike before, which will affect code such as &lt;code&gt;arr[['f1', 'f3']].view('float64')&lt;/code&gt;. This change has been planned since numpy 1.7. Operations hitting this path have emitted &lt;code&gt;FutureWarnings&lt;/code&gt; since then. Additional &lt;code&gt;FutureWarnings&lt;/code&gt; about this change were added in 1.12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help users update their code to account for these changes, a number of functions have been added to the &lt;code&gt;numpy.lib.recfunctions&lt;/code&gt; module which safely allow such operations. For instance, the code above can be replaced with &lt;code&gt;structured_to_unstructured(arr[['f1', 'f3']], dtype='float64')&lt;/code&gt;. See the &quot;accessing multiple fields&quot; section of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html#accessing-multiple-fields&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;C API changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst#id7&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;user-content-id8&quot;&gt;:c:data:`NPY_API_VERSION`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was incremented to 0x0000D, due to the addition of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Integrated squared error (ISE) estimator added to &lt;code&gt;histogram&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method (&lt;code&gt;bins='stone'&lt;/code&gt;) for optimizing the bin number is a generalization of the Scott's rule. The Scott's rule assumes the distribution is approximately Normal, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Minimizing_cross-validation_estimated_squared_error&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ISE&lt;/a&gt; is a non-parametric method based on cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;max_rows&lt;/code&gt; keyword added for &lt;code&gt;np.loadtxt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New keyword &lt;code&gt;max_rows&lt;/code&gt; in numpy.loadtxt sets the maximum rows of the content to be read after &lt;code&gt;skiprows&lt;/code&gt;, as in numpy.genfromtxt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;modulus operator support added for &lt;code&gt;np.timedelta64&lt;/code&gt; operands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modulus (remainder) operator is now supported for two operands of type &lt;code&gt;np.timedelta64&lt;/code&gt;. The operands may have different units and the return value will match the type of the operands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;no-copy pickling of numpy arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to protocol 4, numpy array pickling created 2 spurious copies of the data being serialized. With pickle protocol 5, and the &lt;code&gt;PickleBuffer&lt;/code&gt; API, a large variety of numpy arrays can now be serialized without any copy using out-of-band buffers, and with one less copy using in-band buffers. This results, for large arrays, in an up to 66% drop in peak memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;build shell independence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NumPy builds should no longer interact with the host machine shell directly. &lt;code&gt;exec_command&lt;/code&gt; has been replaced with &lt;code&gt;subprocess.check_output&lt;/code&gt; where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;np.polynomial.Polynomial classes render in LaTeX in Jupyter notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used in a front-end that supports it, Polynomial instances are now rendered through LaTeX. The current format is experimental, and is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;randint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;choice&lt;/code&gt; now work on empty distributions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when no elements needed to be drawn, &lt;code&gt;np.random.randint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;np.random.choice&lt;/code&gt; raised an error when the arguments described an empty distribution. This has been fixed so that e.g. &lt;code&gt;np.random.choice([], 0) == np.array([], dtype=float64)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;linalg.lstsq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;linalg.qr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;linalg.svd&lt;/code&gt; now work with empty arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, a &lt;code&gt;LinAlgError&lt;/code&gt; would be raised when an empty matrix/empty matrices (with zero rows and/or columns) is/are passed in. Now outputs of appropriate shapes are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chain exceptions to give better error messages for invalid PEP3118 format strings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should help track down problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Einsum optimization path updates and efficiency improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einsum was synchronized with the current upstream work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;numpy.angle and numpy.expand_dims now work on &lt;code&gt;ndarray&lt;/code&gt; subclasses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, they now work for masked arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API&lt;/code&gt; compiler warning suppression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API&lt;/code&gt; to a value of 0 will suppress the current compiler warnings when the deprecated numpy API is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.diff&lt;/code&gt; Added kwargs prepend and append&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New kwargs &lt;code&gt;prepend&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt;, allow for values to be inserted on either end of the differences. Similar to options for ediff1d. Now the inverse of cumsum can be obtained easily via &lt;code&gt;prepend=0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ARM support updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for ARM CPUs has been updated to accommodate 32 and 64 bit targets, and also big and little endian byte ordering. AARCH32 memory alignment issues have been addressed. CI testing has been expanded to include AARCH64 targets via the services of shippable.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appending to build flags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;numpy.distutils has always overridden rather than appended to LDFLAGS and other similar such environment variables for compiling Fortran extensions. Now, if the NPY_DISTUTILS_APPEND_FLAGS environment variable is set to 1, the behavior will be appending. This applied to: LDFLAGS, F77FLAGS, F90FLAGS, FREEFLAGS, FOPT, FDEBUG, and FFLAGS. See gh-11525 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Generalized ufunc signatures now allow fixed-size dimensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a numerical value in the signature of a generalized ufunc, one can indicate that the given function requires input or output to have dimensions with the given size. E.g., the signature of a function that converts a polar angle to a two-dimensional cartesian unit vector would be &lt;code&gt;()-&amp;gt;(2)&lt;/code&gt;; that for one that converts two spherical angles to a three-dimensional unit vector would be &lt;code&gt;(),()-&amp;gt;(3)&lt;/code&gt;; and that for the cross product of two three-dimensional vectors would be &lt;code&gt;(3),(3)-&amp;gt;(3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that to the elementary function these dimensions are not treated any differently from variable ones indicated with a name starting with a letter; the loop still is passed the corresponding size, but it can now count on that size being equal to the fixed one given in the signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Generalized ufunc signatures now allow flexible dimensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some functions, in particular numpy's implementation of &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt;, are very similar to generalized ufuncs in that they operate over core dimensions, but one could not present them as such because they were able to deal with inputs in which a dimension is missing. To support this, it is now allowed to postfix a dimension name with a question mark to indicate that the dimension does not necessarily have to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this addition, the signature for &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; can be expressed as &lt;code&gt;(m?,n),(n,p?)-&amp;gt;(m?,p?)&lt;/code&gt;. This indicates that if, e.g., the second operand has only one dimension, for the purposes of the elementary function it will be treated as if that input has core shape &lt;code&gt;(n, 1)&lt;/code&gt;, and the output has the corresponding core shape of &lt;code&gt;(m, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. The actual output array, however, has the flexible dimension removed, i.e., it will have shape &lt;code&gt;(..., m)&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, if both arguments have only a single dimension, the inputs will be presented as having shapes &lt;code&gt;(1, n)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(n, 1)&lt;/code&gt; to the elementary function, and the output as &lt;code&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/code&gt;, while the actual output array returned will have shape &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. In this way, the signature allows one to use a single elementary function for four related but different signatures, &lt;code&gt;(m,n),(n,p)-&amp;gt;(m,p)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(n),(n,p)-&amp;gt;(p)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(m,n),(n)-&amp;gt;(m)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(n),(n)-&amp;gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.clip&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; method check for memory overlap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; argument to these functions is now always tested for memory overlap to avoid corrupted results when memory overlap occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New value &lt;code&gt;unscaled&lt;/code&gt; for option &lt;code&gt;cov&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;np.polyfit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further possible value has been added to the &lt;code&gt;cov&lt;/code&gt; parameter of the &lt;code&gt;np.polyfit&lt;/code&gt; function. With &lt;code&gt;cov='unscaled'&lt;/code&gt; the scaling of the covariance matrix is disabled completely (similar to setting &lt;code&gt;absolute_sigma=True&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;scipy.optimize.curve_fit&lt;/code&gt;). This would be useful in occasions, where the weights are given by 1/sigma with sigma being the (known) standard errors of (Gaussian distributed) data points, in which case the unscaled matrix is already a correct estimate for the covariance matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Detailed docstrings for scalar numeric types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; function, when applied to numeric types such as numpy.intc, numpy.int_, and numpy.longlong, now lists all of the aliased names for that type, distinguishing between platform -dependent and -independent aliases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;__module__&lt;/code&gt; attribute now points to public modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;__module__&lt;/code&gt; attribute on most NumPy functions has been updated to refer to the preferred public module from which to access a function, rather than the module in which the function happens to be defined. This produces more informative displays for functions in tools such as IPython, e.g., instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;function 'numpy.core.fromnumeric.sum'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; you now see &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;function 'numpy.sum'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Large allocations marked as suitable for transparent hugepages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On systems that support transparent hugepages over the madvise system call numpy now marks that large memory allocations can be backed by hugepages which reduces page fault overhead and can in some fault heavy cases improve performance significantly. On Linux the setting for huge pages to be used, /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled, must be at least madvise. Systems which already have it set to always will not see much difference as the kernel will automatically use huge pages where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of very old Linux kernels (~3.x and older) should make sure that /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag is not set to always to avoid performance problems due concurrency issues in the memory defragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Alpine Linux (and other musl c library distros) support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now default to use fenv.h for floating point status error reporting. Previously we had a broken default that sometimes would not report underflow, overflow, and invalid floating point operations. Now we can support non-glibc distrubutions like Alpine Linux as long as they ship fenv.h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speedup &lt;code&gt;np.block&lt;/code&gt; for large arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large arrays (greater than &lt;code&gt;512 * 512&lt;/code&gt;) now use a blocking algorithm based on copying the data directly into the appropriate slice of the resulting array. This results in significant speedups for these large arrays, particularly for arrays being blocked along more than 2 dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;arr.ctypes.data_as(...)&lt;/code&gt; holds a reference to arr&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously the caller was responsible for keeping the array alive for the lifetime of the pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speedup &lt;code&gt;np.take&lt;/code&gt; for read-only arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of &lt;code&gt;np.take&lt;/code&gt; no longer makes an unnecessary copy of the source array when its &lt;code&gt;writeable&lt;/code&gt; flag is set to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Support path-like objects for more functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;np.core.records.fromfile&lt;/code&gt; function now supports &lt;code&gt;pathlib.Path&lt;/code&gt; and other path-like objects in addition to a file object. Furthermore, the &lt;code&gt;np.load&lt;/code&gt; function now also supports path-like objects when using memory mapping (&lt;code&gt;mmap_mode&lt;/code&gt; keyword argument).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Better behaviour of ufunc identities during reductions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal functions have an &lt;code&gt;.identity&lt;/code&gt; which is used when &lt;code&gt;.reduce&lt;/code&gt; is called on an empty axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this release, the logical binary ufuncs, logical_and, logical_or, and logical_xor, now have &lt;code&gt;identity&lt;/code&gt; s of type bool, where previously they were of type int. This restores the 1.14 behavior of getting &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; s when reducing empty object arrays with these ufuncs, while also keeping the 1.15 behavior of getting &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; s when reducing empty object arrays with arithmetic ufuncs like &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;multiply&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, logaddexp now has an identity of &lt;code&gt;-inf&lt;/code&gt;, allowing it to be called on empty sequences, where previously it could not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is possible thanks to the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rst#id17&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;user-content-id18&quot;&gt;:c:function:`PyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignatureAndIdentity`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows arbitrary values to be used as identities now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Improved conversion from ctypes objects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numpy has always supported taking a value or type from &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt; and converting it into an array or dtype, but only behaved correctly for simpler types. As of this release, this caveat is lifted - now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_pack_&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code&gt;ctypes.Structure&lt;/code&gt;, used to emulate C's &lt;code&gt;__attribute__((packed))&lt;/code&gt;, is respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endianness of all ctypes objects is preserved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctypes.Union&lt;/code&gt; is supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-representable constructs raise exceptions, rather than producing dangerously incorrect results:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitfields are no longer interpreted as sub-arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pointers are no longer replaced with the type that they point to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A new &lt;code&gt;ndpointer.contents&lt;/code&gt; member&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matches the &lt;code&gt;.contents&lt;/code&gt; member of normal ctypes arrays, and can be used to construct an &lt;code&gt;np.array&lt;/code&gt; around the pointers contents. This replaces &lt;code&gt;np.array(some_nd_pointer)&lt;/code&gt;, which stopped working in 1.15. As a side effect of this change, &lt;code&gt;ndpointer&lt;/code&gt; now supports dtypes with overlapping fields and padding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; is now a &lt;code&gt;ufunc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;numpy.matmul is now a ufunc which means that both the function and the &lt;code&gt;__matmul__&lt;/code&gt; operator can now be overridden by &lt;code&gt;__array_ufunc__&lt;/code&gt;. Its implementation has also changed. It uses the same BLAS routines as numpy.dot, ensuring its performance is similar for large matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start and stop arrays for &lt;code&gt;linspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logspace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;geomspace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functions used to be limited to scalar stop and start values, but can now take arrays, which will be properly broadcast and result in an output which has one axis prepended. This can be used, e.g., to obtain linearly interpolated points between sets of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CI extended with additional services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now use additional free CI services, thanks to the companies that provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Codecoverage testing via codecov.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arm testing via shippable.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional test runs on azure pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are in addition to our continued use of travis, appveyor (for wheels) and LGTM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Comparison ufuncs will now error rather than return NotImplemented&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, comparison ufuncs such as &lt;code&gt;np.equal&lt;/code&gt; would return NotImplemented if their arguments had structured dtypes, to help comparison operators such as &lt;code&gt;__eq__&lt;/code&gt; deal with those. This is no longer needed, as the relevant logic has moved to the comparison operators proper (which thus do continue to return NotImplemented as needed). Hence, like all other ufuncs, the comparison ufuncs will now error on structured dtypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Positive will now raise a deprecation warning for non-numerical arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;code&gt;+array&lt;/code&gt; unconditionally returned a copy. Now, it will raise a &lt;code&gt;DeprecationWarning&lt;/code&gt; if the array is not numerical (i.e., if &lt;code&gt;np.positive(array)&lt;/code&gt; raises a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt;. For &lt;code&gt;ndarray&lt;/code&gt; subclasses that override the default &lt;code&gt;__array_ufunc__&lt;/code&gt; implementation, the &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; is passed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;NDArrayOperatorsMixin&lt;/code&gt; now implements matrix multiplication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;code&gt;np.lib.mixins.NDArrayOperatorsMixin&lt;/code&gt; did not implement the special methods for Python's matrix multiplication operator (&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;). This has changed now that &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; is a ufunc and can be overridden using &lt;code&gt;__array_ufunc__&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The scaling of the covariance matrix in &lt;code&gt;np.polyfit&lt;/code&gt; is different&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;code&gt;np.polyfit&lt;/code&gt; used a non-standard factor in the scaling of the the covariance matrix. Namely, rather than using the standard &lt;code&gt;chisq/(M-N)&lt;/code&gt;, it scaled it with &lt;code&gt;chisq/(M-N-2)&lt;/code&gt; where M is the number of data points and N is the number of parameters. This scaling is inconsistent with other fitting programs such as e.g. &lt;code&gt;scipy.optimize.curve_fit&lt;/code&gt; and was changed to &lt;code&gt;chisq/(M-N)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;maximum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;minimum&lt;/code&gt; no longer emit warnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of code introduced in 1.10, &lt;code&gt;float32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float64&lt;/code&gt; set invalid float status when a Nan is encountered in numpy.maximum and numpy.minimum, when using SSE2 semantics. This caused a RuntimeWarning to sometimes be emitted. In 1.15 we fixed the inconsistencies which caused the warnings to become more conspicuous. Now no warnings will be emitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Umath and multiarray c-extension modules merged into a single module&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two modules were merged, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0015-merge-multiarray-umath.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NEP 15&lt;/a&gt;. Previously np.core.umath and np.core.multiarray were seperate c-extension modules. They are now python wrappers to the single np.core/_multiarray_math c-extension module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;getfield&lt;/code&gt; validity checks extended&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;numpy.ndarray.getfield now checks the dtype and offset arguments to prevent accessing invalid memory locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;NumPy functions now support overrides with &lt;code&gt;__array_function__&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NumPy has a new experimental mechanism for overriding the implementation of almost all NumPy functions on non-NumPy arrays by defining an &lt;code&gt;__array_function__&lt;/code&gt; method, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NEP 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is not yet been enabled by default, but has been released to facilitate experimentation by potential users. See the NEP for details on setting the appropriate environment variable. We expect the NumPy 1.17 release will enable overrides by default, which will also be more performant due to a new implementation written in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Arrays based off readonly buffers cannot be set &lt;code&gt;writeable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now disallow setting the &lt;code&gt;writeable&lt;/code&gt; flag True on arrays created from &lt;code&gt;fromstring(readonly-buffer)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla laid off my disabled veteran husband then cancelled his sign on bonus</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I think it's remarkable how everyone who gets laid off is &quot;brilliant, honest, and hard working,&quot; yet, still lose their job. Businesses operate without emotion...they hire and fire based upon performance and profit because they owe loyalty to their shareholders. It's not personal.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When hiring senior engineers, you’re not buying, you’re selling</title>
<link>https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/trouble-hiring/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/trouble-hiring/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Undeniably, hiring senior software engineers is hard. However, I don’t buy into the narrative that the market is completely dried out. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with many different engineering teams, which could all be sorted into two categories: The ones struggling to hire seniors and the ones that had an easy time. In fact, the teams in the latter category were usually full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why some teams fail to attract good talent. But all the teams that have an easy time have realized a simple fact about our current market situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring senior engineers, the company doesn’t choose the candidate, the candidate chooses the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, put more simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring senior engineers, you’re not buying, you’re selling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you disagree with the above statement, let me put it into perspective. Some years ago, my resume got into a recruiter network. At the time I had about 3 years of experience as a software engineer in smaller companies. For days my inbox was flooded with recruiter emails. Another time, a few years later, I got unsolicited phone calls from three different recruiters in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story doesn’t say anything about my abilities as an engineer. Many of my colleagues with various backgrounds and skill levels have similar stories. In the current market situation, an engineer with a few years of experience under their belt has lots and lots of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, while I was employed at both those times, I wasn’t particularly happy with my job. I would’ve been interested in new opportunities, but these recruiters did such a bad job at making the offer sound attractive, I declined even meeting any of them in person. So don’t think that senior engineers aren’t interested in your offer, you just have to make it compelling - you have to sell! Most hiring managers and recruiters I’ve talked to tend to agree with this statement. But if you look at what their company is doing when it comes to hiring, their actions don’t match their words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, almost everything we do in modern recruiting is bad. It’s bad for all parties involved, but especially for the candidate. Let’s look at a few specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-job-posting-probably-sucks&quot;&gt;Your job posting probably sucks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re hiring for a different (non-engineering) position. You have posted your job offer, and now you’ve received more than 200 resumes to read through. How much time would you spend on each individual resume? A minute or two, even less? This is the position a senior engineer is in, when looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job posting is like a candidate’s resume. They will only spend a few seconds to judge it, and if it doesn’t catch their attention, they’ll leave. Unfortunately, most job postings are awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at an average job posting for a senior engineering position. I went to one of the big job platforms and searched for “Senior Software Engineer”. I picked a random posting and blurred it because I didn’t want to publicly pick on a specific company. The red areas communicate what the employer needs and the green areas communicate what the employer can offer to the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hiringengineersbook.com/jobposting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of a bad job description&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come from a mindset of buying, this is completely fine - you’re saying what you need. But if you come from a mindset of selling, this is insane! You’re used to reading resumes, so imagine how you’d feel about a candidate whose resume is more than 50% information about what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they’ve probably tried to fill their resume with 100% information about the benefits they can provide for the company. They’ve optimized it to put the most compelling arguments for themselves in the most visible spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post we’re going to look at what the perfect job posting should look like. Sign up for our newsletter bellow to get notified when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-s-probably-too-hard-to-find-information-on-your-company&quot;&gt;It’s probably too hard to find information on your company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond the job posting, most companies make it really hard to find some vital information about them. Be honest, is it easy to find answers to all the following questions that might be super important to prospective hires? Easy as in, max. one click away from your job posting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How’s the company organized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What management style or development methodology (e.g. Scrum, XP) does the team use? Does management have a technical background?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are on the team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you handle working hours? Do you use time tracking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which product/area of the product will I be working on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the office environment look like? What hardware will I be using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do people usually dress at the office?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team go out for lunch together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, different people have different needs. Not everyone will care about all these questions, but to many, your answers will be critically important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve worked with lots of people who had bad experiences with non-technical management. They categorically won’t work with non-technical managers anymore. So if your team does have a manager with a technical background, make sure that your prospective hires know. For some people it’s a huge selling point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at this from a different perspective, let’s put ourselves into the applicant’s shoes. Imagine you were looking to buy a new computer. You see an ad for one that seems interesting, but you still have more questions. So you go to the seller’s website, but you still can’t find all the answers you want. You keep searching and after a while you finally find a phone number. You call them up and ask all your questions, but unfortunately, the person on the phone doesn’t have all the answers. Instead, they tell you to just send in a letter that says why you want to buy the computer. You should also send them a proof that you have enough money to buy it. After that, they say, they might invite you for a personal meeting, where they will gladly answer all the questions you have about the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you really go through this whole process or just find a different computer to buy? This is the experience most applicants have when trying to get answers to the questions above. For most companies, you can’t really get them until you’re interviewing. That’s a big turn-off for most engineers, which brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-hiring-process-interviewing-probably-sucks-and-is-too-slow&quot;&gt;Your hiring process/interviewing probably sucks and is too slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the example of buying a computer from above. Imagine you went through the whole process, and now you’re at the computer store. You still have all the questions from above and you’re waiting for a store rep to give you some answers. But they don’t show up for half an hour after the agreed time. They proceed to bombard you with questions about why you want to buy their computer. They don’t answer any of yours. When it does come to the point where you’re allowed to ask questions, they tell you they don’t have any more time. Or they say they don’t have answers to these questions, because they don’t know the specifics about this computer. They’re asking you to maybe come back later. Also, you’re supposed to fill out a computer quiz first, to make sure you’re good enough with computers to buy one. After you send in the quiz (which took you more than an hour of your own time to complete), you don’t hear back from them for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve personally experienced all these things, sometimes all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this scenario into specific points and recommendations. Most of these should be obvious, but a lot of companies still get them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be on time. Don’t let your candidates wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be well prepared. You should’ve read your candidate’s resume before and have a structure to your interview. You should know as much as possible about the position and be prepared to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be friendly. This seems so obvious but it’s super important and so many companies get it wrong. It’s a question of mindset. Give the candidate the feeling that you genuinely want to hire them. Don’t ever think they have to prove themselves to you - if anything you have to prove yourself to them. Even if they turn out to be a weak candidate, it’s still better to make a good impression on them. Maybe they’ll tell their friends about their great experience or re-apply in a few years with better skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be quick with your decisions, without being pushy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quick-side-note-about-programming-assignments&quot;&gt;A quick side note about programming assignments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s understandable that you want to know if the person you’re hiring can actually do their job and do it well. Going back to the above example of buying a computer, of course the seller wants to verify that you have the funds before you buy. But if they’re smart, they’ll just assume that you have the money. They will only verify that assumption at the very last moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should do the same. Of course, what that moment is, depends a lot on your specific situation and resources. If you have lots of applicants you’re probably going to have to do some kind of pre-assessment of their skills. But whatever you do, do it from the mindset of a seller and try to make the candidate really want the job first. And when it comes to it, you should make your assessment as quick and painless as possible for the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ on this, but if another engineer is doing the interviewing, it might not be necessary to do a formal skill assessment. In my experience, it’s fairly easy to judge technical skill. A friendly conversation about technical interests and recent projects can often be enough. If you decide that a formal assessment is necessary, let the candidate choose between a small take-home project and a time-boxed on-site coding assignment. In any case I recommend making the assessment as close to the real job as possible. Let them use their own laptop, give them internet access, let them ask questions. Make it feel more like you’re working on a challenge together, than it being a test of their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-onboarding-and-management&quot;&gt;Bad Onboarding and Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These topics warrant their own post. What happens after the hiring process might be even more important than the hiring itself. I won’t go into too much detail here, but keep in mind that if the processes in your company aren’t as smooth as they could be, you might have difficulties hiring great people, even with the best sales process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what your position in the company is, there might not be much you can do about it. But you can at least be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of your company and communicate them clearly to your candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, a lot of this is subjective. As I mentioned above, different people want different things in their job. Some people love working from home, others prefer to spend time in an office with a great team around them. It’s important that you talk to your team and know what they prefer and how they currently handle things. This knowledge will enable you to best communicate this to potential applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some managers just aren’t comfortable with certain perks, such as home office, or flexible work hours. So sometimes, even when you are in the mindset of selling, you can’t do everything your applicants want, and that’s OK. Just be aware that not offering some perks is a potential weakness of your company when it comes to hiring engineers. It still helps to know these weaknesses of your “product”, since you’ll be able to communicate them better. And it might even be worth openly communicating your weaknesses. It will keep you from hiring candidates who might be a bad fit in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming from recruiting for another industry, it can be difficult to change your mindset. In most industries, the candidate is the seller. And turning this premise around has a lot of implications. All the systems, tools and processes we’ve established for decades are now no longer applicable, or can be vastly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my advice is to stop fighting this, accept that you’re selling and start to do it well. Whenever you’re doing anything related to hiring, put yourself in the shoes of a candidate who already has 5 offers on the table. Ask yourself: “How can I beat the competition?” Also, make sure everyone who’s involved in the hiring process is on the same page - for example by sharing this post with them! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll be looking at what exactly you’re selling. Spoiler alert: It’s a subscription service. Thankfully, a lot of the methods for building and marketing subscription services also work when you’re trying to attract candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Paris Will Make Public Transportation Free for Kids</title>
<link>https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/paris-metro-tickets-prices-kids-bus-ride-disability-fares/580759/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/paris-metro-tickets-prices-kids-bus-ride-disability-fares/580759/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Parisian elementary school students head back to class after the summer break this year, life may well turn out to be a little cheaper for them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in September, Paris is making all public transit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/paris-la-gratuite-du-metro-pour-les-moins-de-11-ans-c-est-loin-d-etre-anodin-10-01-2019-7985790.php&quot;&gt;free for people under 11&lt;/a&gt;, including non-nationals. Preteens aren’t the only ones getting a bonus, either. All people with disabilities will get free public transit until the age of 20, while high school students between the ages of 14 and 18 will be entitled to a 50 percent tariff reduction. To make transit access for this group even easier, any 14- to 18-year-olds who buy a travel pass will also get a free bikeshare account as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans, which apply across the Greater Paris region and cost an estimated €15 million a year, are part of a staggered plan to make things cheaper for people with mobility challenges. Already last spring, the region introduced a (means-tested) scheme by which adults with disabilities and all people over 65 got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://leparticulier.lefigaro.fr/jcms/p1_1718206/transport-gratuit-a-paris-pour-les-seniors-et-les-personnes-handicapees&quot;&gt;free annual travel pass&lt;/a&gt; if they were on a low-to-medium income. This new plan to extend cheap or no fares toward younger people should make the public transit system more widely accessible and prove to be a happy cost-saver for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should do more than that, too. As more families leave their cars at home to capitalize on the low- or no-fare policies for their children, it could push a modal shift that would reduce pollution and congestion on Paris’s roads. Furthermore, the plans should help to consolidate public opinion behind the city’s long, fairly uncompromising battle to whittle away the urban space granted to cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This battle has been going on in Paris for some time. As CityLab has reported, the city’s roads are steadily &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/03/the-cars-that-ate-paris/520710/&quot;&gt;being pedestrianized&lt;/a&gt; or seeing their number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/01/paris-car-ban-seine-anne-hidalgo/512534/&quot;&gt;car lanes reduced&lt;/a&gt;, and the most polluting cars are experiencing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/05/paris-is-banning-cars-built-before-1997/484895/&quot;&gt;staggered ban&lt;/a&gt; from the inner city. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/09/paris-car-pedestrian-plans-anne-hidalgo/539385/&quot;&gt;chief critics&lt;/a&gt; of these plans have claimed that they are intended for the benefit of wealthier people in the city core at the expense of suburbanites, who often have lower incomes and need cars to make their commutes feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making public transit ever more accessible and affordable, the Paris region serves to provide its own argument against this, and also open a door for the few who are finding running a car that little bit harder. There are already some murmurs of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/high-tech/transports/le-centre-historique-de-paris-bientot-reserve-aux-pietons_129425&quot;&gt;close-to-total ban on cars&lt;/a&gt; in Paris’s historic center coming in the near future, and ensuring that public transit access to the area is easy for everyone seems a sure-fire way of winning public support. For the time being, however, Paris City Hall has ruled out going down the same route as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/12/luxembourg-has-free-public-transit-and-weed-lets-go-man/577525/&quot;&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; and making public transit free for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is surely good news for any Parisian young people hoping to save some cash, especially in the inner city, where daily journeys such as the school run are quite easy to make—and commonly made—via public transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families may nonetheless find their savings under threat from a different quarter. According to the teens interviewed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/paris-la-gratuite-du-metro-pour-les-moins-de-11-ans-c-est-loin-d-etre-anodin-10-01-2019-7985790.php&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, many due to receive a cost reduction are hoping the savings that parents make will be redirected to another vital outlay: their pocket money.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;-Apples. We love to *say* we don't mind &quot;spots on our apples,&quot; but actual sales data tells us really, really do.

And honestly, we should. Even &quot;cosmetic&quot; lesions can make micro-breaks in the apple's skin, allowing fungus to enter. One rotten apple, barrel, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Switching my parents over to Linux saved me a lot of headache and support calls</title>
<link>https://write.as/simonfrey/how-switching-my-parents-over-to-linux-saved-me-a-lot-of-headache-and-support</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://write.as/simonfrey/how-switching-my-parents-over-to-linux-saved-me-a-lot-of-headache-and-support</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1SsLseaH2f8/XBOI0CB_zLI/AAAAAAAAAiM/-dJnOzqzYMMhjA5XEM5eg9znuPoon1ZtwCPcBGAYYCw/s200/tux-oud.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During me being at my parents over the holidays (Christmas 2017) I had the usual IT-support stuff to do, that always happens to tech savvy kids when they are back at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am a happy Linux user for over a decade now, I asked myself if it would be a good idea to switch my parents away from Win 10 to a GNU/Linux &lt;em&gt;(I will call it only Linux during the rest of the post. Sorry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stallman.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; ;) )&lt;/em&gt; based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did that and now 2 years later I still think it was a good idea: I have the peace of mind, that their data is kinda safe and they also call me less often regarding any technical issues with the system. (Yes, Win 10 confused them more than Ubuntu does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following I would like to describe this ongoing journey and how you can follow my example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is structured in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preparation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please keep in mind, that this setup is my very own solution and it is likely, that you need to tweak it to your needs. Disclaimer: I do not care about “FOSS only” or something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background about my parents computer usage: They mainly use their machine for email and web stuff (shopping, social media, online banking,...) and are not heavily into hardware intense gaming or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my parents already used a lot of Free Software as their daily drivers (Thunderbird, Firefox) I did not had to do a big preparation phase. But still I switch them (still on their Win 10) to LibreOffice so that they could get used to it, before changing the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is my first big advice for your:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to not overwhelm them with to much new interfaces at once. Use a step by step solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So first of all, keep them on their current system and help them to adapt to FLOSS software that will be their main driver on the Linux later on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So two steps for preparation here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Sit down with your folks and talk trough their daily usage of their computer &lt;em&gt;(Please be not so arrogant to think you already know it all)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Try to find software replacements for their daily drivers, that will work flawlessly later on the Linux machine. The ones I would recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox as Browser (and maybe Email if they prefere webmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbird for Emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP for Image Editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VLC as Media Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice instead of MS Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as you now did find out and setup replacements for the proprietary Windows software, you should give them time to adapt. I think a month would be suitable. &lt;em&gt;(FYI: I got the most questions during this time, the later switch was less problematic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;switching-over&quot;&gt;Switching over&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your parents now got used to the new software and that will help you to make them adapt easier to the new system, as they now only have to adapt to the new OS interface and not additionally also to a lot new software interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-yourself-a-favor-and-use-standard-ubuntu&quot;&gt;Do yourself a favor and use standard Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are a ton of awesome Linux distros out there &lt;em&gt;(Btw. I use Arch ;))&lt;/em&gt; but my experience during this journey brought me to the conclusion, that the standard Ubuntu is still the best. It is mainly because, all the drivers work mostly out of the box and the distro does a lot automatically. (Because of that, my parents where able to install a new wireless printer without even calling me...beat that Gentoo ;))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that: The Ubuntu community multilingual and open for newbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-journey-until-ubuntu&quot;&gt;The journey until Ubuntu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; we tried different other distros, all suffering at some point &lt;em&gt;(Please bear in mind, that this are all awesome projects and for myself they would work 100%, but for no technical people as my parents a distro just needs to be real solid)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/chaletoslinux/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chalet Os&lt;/a&gt; as it was promoted as most lookalike to Windows. As it is based on XFCE it is lightweight, but the icons and styles differ all over the UI. So you get confused because the settings icon always looks different, depending where in the system you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://elementary.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elementary OS&lt;/a&gt; because I love the UI myself. No clue why, but my parents never got warm with it. It is just a bit to far away from what they are used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href=&quot;https://getsol.us/home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solus OS&lt;/a&gt; has again a more windows looking ui and it worked better for my parents. But after all you have to say Solus is just not there yet. The package manager has to less packages and whenever you have a problem it is super hard to find a solution on the net. Plus: The UI crashed at least once a day. (IMO a driver problem with the machine, but still after hours of work we did not find a solution.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and that now works nice and smooth (For over 8 month now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuke-and-pave&quot;&gt;Nuke and pave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you selected the distro and are now able to nuke and pave the machine. I think I do not have to explain in-depth how to do that, just two important things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backup all you parents data to an external hard drive (Copy the complete C: drive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down upfront what software you want to install and make sure you also backup the configuration and data of those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheating:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to amaze with the new system even more and the machine is still on a HDD, replace it with a SSD, so the Linux system feels even better and faster ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you installed the distro, do a complete configuration. &lt;em&gt;(Yes, go trough every setting and tweak it if needed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now install the software your folks already used on their Windows machine and make sure it is configured in the exact same way as it was on the old system! (That will help a lot in keeping the moral up, because then their is already something that feels familiar to them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I found, that it is best to place the shortcuts of the applications your parents use the most in bar on the left side on Ubuntu, so they find them easily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit down with your parents and ask them, what data the need from the old system and copy only that over. Hereby you clean up the file system by not copying over the old crap they did not use for ages and if they find out later, that there is more data they need it is stored on the backup drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduce-them-to-the-new-system&quot;&gt;Introduce them to the new system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the configuration and setup is now complete you need to allocate some time for introducing them to the new system. You know you parents best so do it in the way the like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me the following routine worked best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0) Explain it to them in two individual sessions &lt;em&gt;(as mostly one of them is more tech savvy then the other one and so both have the chance to ask you individually)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Shutdown the machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Let him/her start the machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Tell her/him to try to do their daily business and whenever questions come up &lt;strong&gt;explain&lt;/strong&gt; how to solve the issue &lt;strong&gt;(Never touch the mouse or keyboard! If you take it over, it is very likely that you will be too fast)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Stop after 60 minutes and if there are still questions do another session the next day (Imagine yourself learning something completely new to you – maybe Chinese – are you able to concentrate more than an hour?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some topics I would recommend you to cover during the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to setup a new wifi connection (especially if the machine is a laptop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to install new software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to setup a new printer/scanner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to print/scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to restore deleted files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get data from/to a USB-stick or mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to shutdown the machine (not that easy to find on Ubuntu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;ongoing-improvements&quot;&gt;Ongoing improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So normally now the system should work as intended and if you are lucky it saves you a lot of problems in the future. In this section I will give you some more recommendations, that helped to make the experience even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;14.462580645161&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux does always ask you for your password if you are doing something that could deeply harm the system. So I told my parents: Whenever that dialog &lt;em&gt;(I showed it to them)&lt;/em&gt; pops up, they should keep in mind, that they could destroy the whole machine with this operation and if they want they can call me first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show them the app store and tell them, whatever they install from there is safe (so no viruses or something) and they can install everything they want as long it is from there. It makes fun to find new cool software and games, so help them to experience that fun too :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.9596774193548&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backups! As it is really easy with Linux you should do a automatic daily/hourly backup of their complete home folder. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borgbackup.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;borg&lt;/a&gt; for that. &lt;em&gt;(I plan to to write an in-depth blog post about borg in the future, it will be linked here if it is done)&lt;/em&gt;. So now, whenever my parents call me and tell me that they deleted something or that the machine does not boot anymore I can relax and tell them, that we can restore all there data in a matter of minutes....you can't image how good that makes me feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not FOSS, but I did install google chrome as it was the easiest for watching netflix and listening to spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend installing some privacy plugins and stuff into the browser your parents use, so you get them even safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have some software that does not have a good replacement, try to use wine for it. Worked well with MS Office 2007. (Sorry LibreOffice, but you still can't compete with MS here). &lt;em&gt;PlayOnLinux did help me a lot with the wine setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 21.01.2018 – 10am: Thanks for all your feedback recommending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wps.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WPS Office&lt;/a&gt;! We tried it a while ago and it was less stable than the Wine+MS Office setup, that is why we dumped it again. Another reader suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onlyoffice.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OnlyOffice&lt;/a&gt; which I will give a try, as I did not know it before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If possible activate the automatic update and installation of all security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the switch made a lot of sense, as my parents are not heavy technical users of there systems. Should yours be into Photoshop, video editing or gaming I do not think it will be so easy to do the switch over, as Linux and its software is still not a good competitor in this areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to get your feedback on this blog post: &lt;em&gt;Did you switch your parents to Linux and how did that work out? Do you have other insights that should be added to this post?

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Simon Frey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;p.S. One reason why my parents machine did not boot anymore for several times, was a plugged in usb stick and the bios tried to boot from it. So do not forget to reset the boot order to first boot of the hard drive ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
