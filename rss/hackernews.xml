<title>H&amp;R Block and Intuit Lobby Against Free and Simple Tax Filing (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s how preparing your taxes could work: You sit down, review a prefilled filing from the government. If it’s accurate, you sign it. If it’s not, you fix it or ignore it altogether and prepare your return yourself. It’s your choice. You might not have to pay for an accountant, or fiddle for hours with complex software. It could all be over in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already like that in parts of Europe. And it would not be particularly difficult to give U.S. taxpayers the same option. After all, the government already gets earnings information from employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as ProPublica has detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, Intuit — the makers of TurboTax — and H&amp;amp;R Block have lobbied for years to derail any move toward such a system. And they continued in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000026667&quot;&gt;more than $2 million&lt;/a&gt; lobbying last year, much of it spent on legislation that would permanently bar the government from offering taxpayers prefilled returns. H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;spent $3 million&lt;/a&gt;, also directing some of their efforts towards the bill. Among the 60 co-sponsors of the bipartisan bill: then congressman and now Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, called the Free File Act of 2016, looks on the surface to be consumer-friendly. It makes permanent a public-private partnership in which 13 private tax preparation companies — called the “Free File Alliance” — have offered free online tax filings to lower- and middle-income families. The Free File Alliance include both Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the legislation would also permanently bar the IRS from offering its own free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit has repeatedly warned investors about the prospect of government-prepared returns. “We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,” Intuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000896878/3951ce1d-50d0-40fb-af50-f3d51d410b6e.pdf&quot;&gt;said in its latest corporate filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered a bill last year that would have actually allowed the government to start offering prefill tax returns. While Intuit did not lobby against Warren’s bill — presumably because the legislation had little chance of success — tax giant H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. (H&amp;amp;R Block did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Warren’s bill nor the Free File Act made it out of committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few of those eligible for the industry’s no-charge filing program actually use it, perhaps because the system is confusing and pushes people toward paid products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Free File Alliance says 70 percent of U.S. taxpayers can use the service, less than 2 percent of all individual tax returns were filed through the program in last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2016-ARC/ARC16_Volume1.pdf&quot;&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; a National Taxpayer Advocate’s report to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s call the so-called Free File Alliance what it really is — a front for tax prep companies who use it as a gateway to sell expensive products no one would even need if we’d just made it easier for people to pay their taxes,” said Warren in a statement to ProPublica. Warren’s office put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Tax_Maze_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the issue last year that repeatedly cited our coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement the Free File Alliance’s executive director, Tim Hugo, said that the alliance does not automatically push paid products to those that use the Free File program but the taxpayer does “have the option of ‘opting in’ to receive additional information and offers from the tax preparation company they have selected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the lack of awareness of the program is “unfortunate,” and placed blame on the IRS. While the tax agency previously had a large budget to advertise the Free File program, “today that budget is $0, making it difficult to reach the general public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Warren’s bill, the Free File Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freefilealliance.org/news/press-releases/free-file-program-tax-filing-simplification-act-would-create-a-conflict-of-interest-end-a-free-program-that-s-working-for-taxpayers/&quot;&gt;warned in press release&lt;/a&gt; that allowing the IRS to prep returns would create “a tremendous and potentially harmful conflict of interest for the American people by enshrining the roles of tax preparer, tax collector, tax auditor and tax enforcer in one entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo is also a state legislator in Virginia, which canceled its own cost-free system of tax filing in 2010 and replaced it with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB1349&quot;&gt;“Free File” bill&lt;/a&gt; connecting taxpayers to private companies. Hugo serves on the committee that greenlighted the legislation. Hugo said he saw no conflict of interest here, as the Free File program he represents is federal, not state, and he recused himself from voting in the committee and on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Bankman, a law professor in tax law at Stanford Law School said arguments about government overreach are false. Participation is voluntary and actually gives taxpayers the upper hand, forcing the government to “show its hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you know what the government knows,” Bankman said, who added that there are multiple ways taxpayers could benefit. “If there’s a mistake that goes in your favor, maybe you don’t call attention to it.” Also, everyone would receive the returns — including the millions of Americans who are due tax refunds but don’t get them because they don’t file. In 2012 alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-has-refunds-totaling-950-million-dollars-for-people-who-have-not-filed-a-2012-federal-income-tax-return&quot;&gt;the IRS said&lt;/a&gt; more than 1 million Americans did not receive their refunds — amounting to $950 million — because they did not file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the federal Free File bill have repeatedly voiced fears of big-government interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;7.1936758893281&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuit, producer of the top-selling tax software, has opposed letting the government do your taxes for free — even though it could save time and headaches for millions of filers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece for The Daily Caller and &lt;a href=&quot;https://roskam.house.gov/media-center/speeches/its-time-to-codify-the-free-file-program&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said “making the tax collector also the tax preparer creates an inherent conflict of interest while forcing citizens to relinquish control of their taxes to the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 election cycle, Roskam &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $32,000 in donations from Intuit’s political action committee and Intuit employees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; a far smaller amount, $2,500, from H&amp;amp;R Block — all for the 2016 election cycle. Roskam’s office did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Price &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;received only modest donations&lt;/a&gt; from Intuit, $3,500 since 2008 — $2,500 of which came six days after the Free File Act of 2016 was announced. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $2,000 total from H&amp;amp;R Block. (Price’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill’s Democrat co-author, Ron Kind, from Wisconsin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2002%2C2004%2C2006%2C2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=a&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $29,000 from Intuit and its employees since 2008. &lt;a href=&quot;https://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $3,000 from H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Kind said he is “open to working with anyone” to find ways for “hardworking Wisconsin families” to file their taxes with ease. “At the same time, I want to make sure that Wisconsinites can access programs, like Free File, that they have come to depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for details on how many Wisconsinites actually rely on the program, given that few of those who qualify for it actually use it, a spokesperson for Kind did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla laid off my disabled veteran husband then cancelled his sign on bonus</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I think it's remarkable how everyone who gets laid off is &quot;brilliant, honest, and hard working,&quot; yet, still lose their job. Businesses operate without emotion...they hire and fire based upon performance and profit because they owe loyalty to their shareholders. It's not personal.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When hiring senior engineers, you’re not buying, you’re selling</title>
<link>https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/trouble-hiring/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/trouble-hiring/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Undeniably, hiring senior software engineers is hard. However, I don’t buy into the narrative that the market is completely dried out. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with many different engineering teams, which could all be sorted into two categories: The ones struggling to hire seniors and the ones that had an easy time. In fact, the teams in the latter category were usually full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why some teams fail to attract good talent. But all the teams that have an easy time have realized a simple fact about our current market situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring senior engineers, the company doesn’t choose the candidate, the candidate chooses the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, put more simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring senior engineers, you’re not buying, you’re selling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you disagree with the above statement, let me put it into perspective. Some years ago, my resume got into a recruiter network. At the time I had about 3 years of experience as a software engineer in smaller companies. For days my inbox was flooded with recruiter emails. Another time, a few years later, I got unsolicited phone calls from three different recruiters in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story doesn’t say anything about my abilities as an engineer. Many of my colleagues with various backgrounds and skill levels have similar stories. In the current market situation, an engineer with a few years of experience under their belt has lots and lots of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, while I was employed at both those times, I wasn’t particularly happy with my job. I would’ve been interested in new opportunities, but these recruiters did such a bad job at making the offer sound attractive, I declined even meeting any of them in person. So don’t think that senior engineers aren’t interested in your offer, you just have to make it compelling - you have to sell! Most hiring managers and recruiters I’ve talked to tend to agree with this statement. But if you look at what their company is doing when it comes to hiring, their actions don’t match their words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, almost everything we do in modern recruiting is bad. It’s bad for all parties involved, but especially for the candidate. Let’s look at a few specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-job-posting-probably-sucks&quot;&gt;Your job posting probably sucks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re hiring for a different (non-engineering) position. You have posted your job offer, and now you’ve received more than 200 resumes to read through. How much time would you spend on each individual resume? A minute or two, even less? This is the position a senior engineer is in, when looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job posting is like a candidate’s resume. They will only spend a few seconds to judge it, and if it doesn’t catch their attention, they’ll leave. Unfortunately, most job postings are awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at an average job posting for a senior engineering position. I went to one of the big job platforms and searched for “Senior Software Engineer”. I picked a random posting and blurred it because I didn’t want to publicly pick on a specific company. The red areas communicate what the employer needs and the green areas communicate what the employer can offer to the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hiringengineersbook.com/jobposting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of a bad job description&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come from a mindset of buying, this is completely fine - you’re saying what you need. But if you come from a mindset of selling, this is insane! You’re used to reading resumes, so imagine how you’d feel about a candidate whose resume is more than 50% information about what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they’ve probably tried to fill their resume with 100% information about the benefits they can provide for the company. They’ve optimized it to put the most compelling arguments for themselves in the most visible spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post we’re going to look at what the perfect job posting should look like. Sign up for our newsletter bellow to get notified when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-s-probably-too-hard-to-find-information-on-your-company&quot;&gt;It’s probably too hard to find information on your company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond the job posting, most companies make it really hard to find some vital information about them. Be honest, is it easy to find answers to all the following questions that might be super important to prospective hires? Easy as in, max. one click away from your job posting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How’s the company organized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What management style or development methodology (e.g. Scrum, XP) does the team use? Does management have a technical background?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are on the team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you handle working hours? Do you use time tracking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which product/area of the product will I be working on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the office environment look like? What hardware will I be using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do people usually dress at the office?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team go out for lunch together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, different people have different needs. Not everyone will care about all these questions, but to many, your answers will be critically important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve worked with lots of people who had bad experiences with non-technical management. They categorically won’t work with non-technical managers anymore. So if your team does have a manager with a technical background, make sure that your prospective hires know. For some people it’s a huge selling point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at this from a different perspective, let’s put ourselves into the applicant’s shoes. Imagine you were looking to buy a new computer. You see an ad for one that seems interesting, but you still have more questions. So you go to the seller’s website, but you still can’t find all the answers you want. You keep searching and after a while you finally find a phone number. You call them up and ask all your questions, but unfortunately, the person on the phone doesn’t have all the answers. Instead, they tell you to just send in a letter that says why you want to buy the computer. You should also send them a proof that you have enough money to buy it. After that, they say, they might invite you for a personal meeting, where they will gladly answer all the questions you have about the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you really go through this whole process or just find a different computer to buy? This is the experience most applicants have when trying to get answers to the questions above. For most companies, you can’t really get them until you’re interviewing. That’s a big turn-off for most engineers, which brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newsletter-card card text-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-hiring-process-interviewing-probably-sucks-and-is-too-slow&quot;&gt;Your hiring process/interviewing probably sucks and is too slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the example of buying a computer from above. Imagine you went through the whole process, and now you’re at the computer store. You still have all the questions from above and you’re waiting for a store rep to give you some answers. But they don’t show up for half an hour after the agreed time. They proceed to bombard you with questions about why you want to buy their computer. They don’t answer any of yours. When it does come to the point where you’re allowed to ask questions, they tell you they don’t have any more time. Or they say they don’t have answers to these questions, because they don’t know the specifics about this computer. They’re asking you to maybe come back later. Also, you’re supposed to fill out a computer quiz first, to make sure you’re good enough with computers to buy one. After you send in the quiz (which took you more than an hour of your own time to complete), you don’t hear back from them for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve personally experienced all these things, sometimes all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this scenario into specific points and recommendations. Most of these should be obvious, but a lot of companies still get them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be on time. Don’t let your candidates wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be well prepared. You should’ve read your candidate’s resume before and have a structure to your interview. You should know as much as possible about the position and be prepared to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be friendly. This seems so obvious but it’s super important and so many companies get it wrong. It’s a question of mindset. Give the candidate the feeling that you genuinely want to hire them. Don’t ever think they have to prove themselves to you - if anything you have to prove yourself to them. Even if they turn out to be a weak candidate, it’s still better to make a good impression on them. Maybe they’ll tell their friends about their great experience or re-apply in a few years with better skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be quick with your decisions, without being pushy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quick-side-note-about-programming-assignments&quot;&gt;A quick side note about programming assignments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s understandable that you want to know if the person you’re hiring can actually do their job and do it well. Going back to the above example of buying a computer, of course the seller wants to verify that you have the funds before you buy. But if they’re smart, they’ll just assume that you have the money. They will only verify that assumption at the very last moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should do the same. Of course, what that moment is, depends a lot on your specific situation and resources. If you have lots of applicants you’re probably going to have to do some kind of pre-assessment of their skills. But whatever you do, do it from the mindset of a seller and try to make the candidate really want the job first. And when it comes to it, you should make your assessment as quick and painless as possible for the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ on this, but if another engineer is doing the interviewing, it might not be necessary to do a formal skill assessment. In my experience, it’s fairly easy to judge technical skill. A friendly conversation about technical interests and recent projects can often be enough. If you decide that a formal assessment is necessary, let the candidate choose between a small take-home project and a time-boxed on-site coding assignment. In any case I recommend making the assessment as close to the real job as possible. Let them use their own laptop, give them internet access, let them ask questions. Make it feel more like you’re working on a challenge together, than it being a test of their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-onboarding-and-management&quot;&gt;Bad Onboarding and Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These topics warrant their own post. What happens after the hiring process might be even more important than the hiring itself. I won’t go into too much detail here, but keep in mind that if the processes in your company aren’t as smooth as they could be, you might have difficulties hiring great people, even with the best sales process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what your position in the company is, there might not be much you can do about it. But you can at least be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of your company and communicate them clearly to your candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, a lot of this is subjective. As I mentioned above, different people want different things in their job. Some people love working from home, others prefer to spend time in an office with a great team around them. It’s important that you talk to your team and know what they prefer and how they currently handle things. This knowledge will enable you to best communicate this to potential applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some managers just aren’t comfortable with certain perks, such as home office, or flexible work hours. So sometimes, even when you are in the mindset of selling, you can’t do everything your applicants want, and that’s OK. Just be aware that not offering some perks is a potential weakness of your company when it comes to hiring engineers. It still helps to know these weaknesses of your “product”, since you’ll be able to communicate them better. And it might even be worth openly communicating your weaknesses. It will keep you from hiring candidates who might be a bad fit in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming from recruiting for another industry, it can be difficult to change your mindset. In most industries, the candidate is the seller. And turning this premise around has a lot of implications. All the systems, tools and processes we’ve established for decades are now no longer applicable, or can be vastly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my advice is to stop fighting this, accept that you’re selling and start to do it well. Whenever you’re doing anything related to hiring, put yourself in the shoes of a candidate who already has 5 offers on the table. Ask yourself: “How can I beat the competition?” Also, make sure everyone who’s involved in the hiring process is on the same page - for example by sharing this post with them! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll be looking at what exactly you’re selling. Spoiler alert: It’s a subscription service. Thankfully, a lot of the methods for building and marketing subscription services also work when you’re trying to attract candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Switching my parents over to Linux saved me a lot of headache and support calls</title>
<link>https://write.as/simonfrey/how-switching-my-parents-over-to-linux-saved-me-a-lot-of-headache-and-support</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://write.as/simonfrey/how-switching-my-parents-over-to-linux-saved-me-a-lot-of-headache-and-support</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1SsLseaH2f8/XBOI0CB_zLI/AAAAAAAAAiM/-dJnOzqzYMMhjA5XEM5eg9znuPoon1ZtwCPcBGAYYCw/s200/tux-oud.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During me being at my parents over the holidays (Christmas 2017) I had the usual IT-support stuff to do, that always happens to tech savvy kids when they are back at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am a happy Linux user for over a decade now, I asked myself if it would be a good idea to switch my parents away from Win 10 to a GNU/Linux &lt;em&gt;(I will call it only Linux during the rest of the post. Sorry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stallman.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; ;) )&lt;/em&gt; based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did that and now 2 years later I still think it was a good idea: I have the peace of mind, that their data is kinda safe and they also call me less often regarding any technical issues with the system. (Yes, Win 10 confused them more than Ubuntu does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following I would like to describe this ongoing journey and how you can follow my example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is structured in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preparation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please keep in mind, that this setup is my very own solution and it is likely, that you need to tweak it to your needs. Disclaimer: I do not care about “FOSS only” or something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background about my parents computer usage: They mainly use their machine for email and web stuff (shopping, social media, online banking,...) and are not heavily into hardware intense gaming or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my parents already used a lot of Free Software as their daily drivers (Thunderbird, Firefox) I did not had to do a big preparation phase. But still I switch them (still on their Win 10) to LibreOffice so that they could get used to it, before changing the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is my first big advice for your:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to not overwhelm them with to much new interfaces at once. Use a step by step solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So first of all, keep them on their current system and help them to adapt to FLOSS software that will be their main driver on the Linux later on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So two steps for preparation here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Sit down with your folks and talk trough their daily usage of their computer &lt;em&gt;(Please be not so arrogant to think you already know it all)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Try to find software replacements for their daily drivers, that will work flawlessly later on the Linux machine. The ones I would recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox as Browser (and maybe Email if they prefere webmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbird for Emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP for Image Editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VLC as Media Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice instead of MS Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as you now did find out and setup replacements for the proprietary Windows software, you should give them time to adapt. I think a month would be suitable. &lt;em&gt;(FYI: I got the most questions during this time, the later switch was less problematic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;switching-over&quot;&gt;Switching over&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your parents now got used to the new software and that will help you to make them adapt easier to the new system, as they now only have to adapt to the new OS interface and not additionally also to a lot new software interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-yourself-a-favor-and-use-standard-ubuntu&quot;&gt;Do yourself a favor and use standard Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are a ton of awesome Linux distros out there &lt;em&gt;(Btw. I use Arch ;))&lt;/em&gt; but my experience during this journey brought me to the conclusion, that the standard Ubuntu is still the best. It is mainly because, all the drivers work mostly out of the box and the distro does a lot automatically. (Because of that, my parents where able to install a new wireless printer without even calling me...beat that Gentoo ;))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that: The Ubuntu community multilingual and open for newbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-journey-until-ubuntu&quot;&gt;The journey until Ubuntu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; we tried different other distros, all suffering at some point &lt;em&gt;(Please bear in mind, that this are all awesome projects and for myself they would work 100%, but for no technical people as my parents a distro just needs to be real solid)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/chaletoslinux/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chalet Os&lt;/a&gt; as it was promoted as most lookalike to Windows. As it is based on XFCE it is lightweight, but the icons and styles differ all over the UI. So you get confused because the settings icon always looks different, depending where in the system you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://elementary.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elementary OS&lt;/a&gt; because I love the UI myself. No clue why, but my parents never got warm with it. It is just a bit to far away from what they are used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href=&quot;https://getsol.us/home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solus OS&lt;/a&gt; has again a more windows looking ui and it worked better for my parents. But after all you have to say Solus is just not there yet. The package manager has to less packages and whenever you have a problem it is super hard to find a solution on the net. Plus: The UI crashed at least once a day. (IMO a driver problem with the machine, but still after hours of work we did not find a solution.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and that now works nice and smooth (For over 8 month now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuke-and-pave&quot;&gt;Nuke and pave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you selected the distro and are now able to nuke and pave the machine. I think I do not have to explain in-depth how to do that, just two important things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backup all you parents data to an external hard drive (Copy the complete C: drive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down upfront what software you want to install and make sure you also backup the configuration and data of those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Cheating: ** If you want to amaze with the new system even more and the machine is still on a HDD, replace it with a SSD, so the Linux system feels even better and faster ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you installed the distro, do a complete configuration. &lt;em&gt;(Yes, go trough every setting and tweak it if needed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now install the software your folks already used on their Windows machine and make sure it is configured in the exact same way as it was on the old system! (That will help a lot in keeping the moral up, because then their is already something that feels familiar to them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I found, that it is best to place the shortcuts of the applications your parents use the most in bar on the left side on Ubuntu, so they find them easily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit down with your parents and ask them, what data the need from the old system and copy only that over. Hereby you clean up the file system by not copying over the old crap they did not use for ages and if they find out later, that there is more data they need it is stored on the backup drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduce-them-to-the-new-system&quot;&gt;Introduce them to the new system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the configuration and setup is now complete you need to allocate some time for introducing them to the new system. You know you parents best so do it in the way the like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me the following routine worked best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0) Explain it to them in two individual sessions &lt;em&gt;(as mostly one of them is more tech savvy then the other one and so both have the chance to ask you individually)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Shutdown the machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Let him/her start the machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Tell her/him to try to do their daily business and whenever questions come up &lt;strong&gt;explain&lt;/strong&gt; how to solve the issue &lt;strong&gt;(Never touch the mouse or keyboard! If you take it over, it is very likely that you will be too fast)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Stop after 60 minutes and if there are still questions do another session the next day (Imagine yourself learning something completely new to you – maybe Chinese – are you able to concentrate more than an hour?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some topics I would recommend you to cover during the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to setup a new wifi connection (especially if the machine is a laptop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to install new software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to setup a new printer/scanner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to print/scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to restore deleted files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get data from/to a USB-stick or mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to shutdown the machine (not that easy to find on Ubuntu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;ongoing-improvements&quot;&gt;Ongoing improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So normally now the system should work as intended and if you are lucky it saves you a lot of problems in the future. In this section I will give you some more recommendations, that helped to make the experience even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.46205630355&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux does always ask you for your password if you are doing something that could deeply harm the system. So I told my parents: Whenever that dialog &lt;em&gt;(I showed it to them)&lt;/em&gt; pops up, they should keep in mind, that they could destroy the whole machine with this operation and if they want they can call me first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show them the app store and tell them, whatever they install from there is safe (so no viruses or something) and they can install everything they want as long it is from there. It makes fun to find new cool software and games, so help them to experience that fun too :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.9596774193548&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backups! As it is really easy with Linux you should do a automatic daily/hourly backup of their complete home folder. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borgbackup.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;borg&lt;/a&gt; for that. &lt;em&gt;(I plan to to write an in-depth blog post about borg in the future, it will be linked here if it is done)&lt;/em&gt;. So now, whenever my parents call me and tell me that they deleted something or that the machine does not boot anymore I can relax and tell them, that we can restore all there data in a matter of minutes....you can't image how good that makes me feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not FOSS, but I did install google chrome as it was the easiest for watching netflix and listening to spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend installing some privacy plugins and stuff into the browser your parents use, so you get them even safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have some software that does not have a good replacement, try to use wine for it. Worked well with MS Office 2007. (Sorry LibreOffice, but you still can't compete with MS here). &lt;em&gt;PlayOnLinux did help me a lot with the wine setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible activate the automatic update and installation of all security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the switch made a lot of sense, as my parents are not heavy technical users of there systems. Should yours be into Photoshop, video editing or gaming I do not think it will be so easy to do the switch over, as Linux and its software is still not a good competitor in this areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to get your feedback on this blog post: &lt;em&gt;Did you switch your parents to Linux and how did that work out? Do you have other insights that should be added to this post?

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Simon Frey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;p.S. One reason why my parents machine did not boot anymore for several times, was a plugged in usb stick and the bios tried to boot from it. So do not forget to reset the boot order to first boot of the hard drive ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Kubernetes Failure Stories</title>
<link>https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-failure-stories.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-failure-stories.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;../galleries/kubernetes-logo.png&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;https://srcco.de/galleries/kubernetes-logo.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to compile a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories&quot;&gt;list of public failure/horror stories related to Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;. It should make it easier for people tasked with operations to find outage reports to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we started with Kubernetes at Zalando in 2016, we collected many internal postmortems. Docker bugs (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/28889&quot;&gt;daemon unresponsive&lt;/a&gt;, process stuck in pipe wait, ..) were a major pain point in the beginning, but Docker itself has become more mature and did not bite us recently. The biggest chunk of problems can be attributed to the nature of distributed systems and &quot;cascading failures&quot;, e.g. a Kubernetes API server outage should not affect running workloads, but &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/406&quot;&gt;it did&lt;/a&gt;, or see &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sszuecs/status/1085292025895940097&quot;&gt;our recent CoreDNS incident&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared some of our incidents and Kubernetes failures in talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for giving such talks about failures is that &lt;strong&gt;I want to hear more of them myself!&lt;/strong&gt; Nordstrom's &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO9nx6GBu0&quot;&gt;talk &quot;101 Ways to Crash Your Cluster&quot; on KubeCon 2017&lt;/a&gt; was my inspiration (as you can even see from the similarity in talk titles ;-)). I hope to see more people share their postmortems and give failure talks. Monzo's transparency and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://community.monzo.com/t/resolved-current-account-payments-may-fail-major-outage-27-10-2017/26296/95&quot;&gt;public postmortem&lt;/a&gt; is a great service to the community and should be something we all strive towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;compiling-a-list-of-kubernetes-failure-stories&quot; readability=&quot;18.053007135576&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compiling a List of Kubernetes Failure Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my quest to find more public Kubernetes failure stories, I discovered that it's either really hard to find them (or my web search skills are lacking) or that there are only very few published. Search terms I tried on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; and Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried various combinations and &quot;k8s&quot;, &quot;kube-dns&quot;, and &quot;kube-proxy&quot; instead of &quot;kubernetes&quot;. This did not yield many results and most of the pages I found are somehow more &quot;success&quot; stories and highlight how to prevent outages from happening. That's boring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories&quot;&gt;compiled list of Kubernetes Failure Stories I found so far is available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to see many contributions to the list from the community, but I guess the hard part is encouraging people to publish their outage reports. &lt;strong&gt;Please contribute to the list&lt;/strong&gt; by opening an issue, creating a PR or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/try_except_&quot;&gt;reaching out to me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be on a meetup in Hamburg in February to talk more about Kubernetes failures, please join if you can: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/inovex-Meetup-Hamburg/events/258065688/&quot;&gt;&quot;Let’s talk about Failures with Kubernetes!&quot; meetup Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Zalando, we will try to publish a write-up of our recent Kubernetes DNS incident and hopefully find a way to more systematically share postmortems with the community. Sharing our failure stories is something we can all benefit from to harden our setups and help prioritize upstream issues. &quot;Production-readiness&quot; is, from my perspective, still something mostly discussed behind closed doors (i.e. inside organizations) --- e.g. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/try_except_/optimizing-kubernetes-resource-requestslimits-for-costefficiency-and-latency-highload&quot;&gt;CPU CFS quota behavior and latency impact&lt;/a&gt; is not well known and not mentioned in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/&quot;&gt;the docs&lt;/a&gt;. Let's change that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW: I'm also still looking for the first Istio failure talk..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ipedrazas/status/979293422199738368&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;../galleries/twitter-istio-horror-story.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://srcco.de/galleries/twitter-istio-horror-story.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some recommended talks/reads for Kubernetes in production:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Windows 98 Icons are Great</title>
<link>https://alexmeub.com/old-windows-icons/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alexmeub.com/old-windows-icons/</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;February 26, 2015&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the UI design of Windows peaked in the late 1990s. The classic, utilitarian icons from Windows 98 just look amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alexmeub.com/assets/win98-icons-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-they-so-good&quot;&gt;Why are they so good?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than some designer’s flashy vision of the future, Windows 98 icons made the operating system feel like a place to get real work done. They had hard edges, soft colors and easy-to-recognize symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that the icons were meticulously crafted. Each 256-color .ico file includes a pixel-perfect 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 version that looks equally good on the taskbar and desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe its nostalgia, but I still prefer the classic icons of Windows 98 over the shiny, drop-shadowed icons of later years. You can download the entire Windows 98 collection of .ico files &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.alexmeub.com.s3.amazonaws.com/other/win98_icons.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;check-this-out&quot;&gt;Check this out!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking an nostalgic way to scroll through the whole collection of Windows 98 icons (including the many icon versions embedded in each ico file), check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://win98icons.alexmeub.com&quot;&gt;win98icons.alexmeub.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://win98icons.alexmeub.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alexmeub.com/assets/project-windows98-icons.png&quot; class=&quot;project-img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Students learn from people they love</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/learning-emotion-education.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/learning-emotion-education.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A few years ago, when I was teaching at Yale, I made an announcement to my class. I said that I was going to have to cancel office hours that day because I was dealing with some personal issues and a friend was coming up to help me sort through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I was no more specific than that, but that evening 10 or 15 students emailed me to say they were thinking of me or praying for me. For the rest of the term the tenor of that seminar was different. We were closer. That one tiny whiff of vulnerability meant that I wasn’t aloof Professor Brooks, I was just another schmo trying to get through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That unplanned moment illustrated for me the connection between emotional relationships and learning. We used to have this top-down notion that reason was on a teeter-totter with emotion. If you wanted to be rational and think well, you had to suppress those primitive gremlins, the emotions. Teaching consisted of dispassionately downloading knowledge into students’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then work by cognitive scientists like Antonio Damasio showed us that emotion is not the opposite of reason; it’s essential to reason. Emotions assign value to things. If you don’t know what you want, you can’t make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Furthermore, emotions tell you what to pay attention to, care about and remember. It’s hard to work through difficulty if your emotions aren’t engaged. Information is plentiful, but motivation is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That early neuroscience breakthrough reminded us that a key job of a school is to give students new things to love — an exciting field of study, new friends. It reminded us that what teachers really teach is themselves — their contagious passion for their subjects and students. It reminded us that children learn from people they love, and that love in this context means willing the good of another, and offering active care for the whole person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over the last several years our understanding of the relationship between emotion and learning has taken off. My impression is that neuroscientists today spend less time trying to locate exactly where in the brain things happen and more time trying to understand the different neural networks and what activates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Everything is integrated. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang of the University of Southern California shows that even “sophisticated” emotions like moral admiration are experienced partly by the same “primitive” parts of the brain that monitor internal organs and the viscera. Our emotions literally affect us in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Patricia Kuhl of the University of Washington has shown that the social brain pervades every learning process. She gave infants Chinese lessons. Some infants took face-to-face lessons with a tutor. Their social brain was activated through direct eye contact and such, and they learned Chinese sounds at an amazing clip. Others watched the same lessons through a video screen. They paid rapt attention, but learned nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Extreme negative emotions, like fear, can have a devastating effect on a student’s ability to learn. Fear amps up threat perception and aggression. It can also subsequently make it hard for children to understand causal relationships, or to change their mind as context changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even when conditions are ideal, think of all the emotions that are involved in mastering a hard subject like algebra: curiosity, excitement, frustration, confusion, dread, delight, worry and, hopefully, perseverance and joy. You’ve got to have an educated emotional vocabulary to maneuver through all those stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And students have got to have a good relationship with teachers. Suzanne Dikker of New York University has shown that when classes are going well, the student brain activity synchronizes with the teacher’s brain activity. In good times and bad, good teachers and good students co-regulate each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The bottom line is this, a defining question for any school or company is: What is the quality of the emotional relationships here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And yet think about your own school or organization. Do you have a metric for measuring relationship quality? Do you have teams reviewing relationship quality? Do you know where relationships are good and where they are bad? How many recent ed reform trends have been about relationship-building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We focus on all the wrong things because we have an outmoded conception of how thinking really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The good news is the social and emotional learning movement has been steadily gaining strength. This week the Aspen Institute (where I lead a program) published a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://nationathope.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national commission report&lt;/a&gt; called “From a Nation at Risk to a Nation at Hope.” Social and emotional learning is not an add-on curriculum; one educator said at the report’s launch, “It’s the way we do school.” Some schools, for example, do no academic instruction the first week. To start, everybody just gets to know one another. Other schools replaced the cops at the door with security officers who could also serve as student coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When you start thinking this way it opens up the wide possibilities for change. How would you design a school if you wanted to put relationship quality at the core? Come to think of it, how would you design a Congress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psfkbx etfikam0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Follow The New York Times Opinion section on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Twitter (@NYTopinion)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nytopinion/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japan&amp;#039;s Rail Workers Pointing at Things (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Tokyo train driver pointing at meters on the dashboard.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-40790&quot; data-src=&quot;//assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/40790/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A Tokyo train driver pointing at meters on the dashboard. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;It is hard to miss&lt;/span&gt; when taking the train in Tokyo. White-gloved employees in crisp uniforms pointing smartly down the platform and calling out—seemingly to no one—as trains glide in and out of the station. Onboard is much the same, with drivers and conductors performing almost ritual-like movements as they tend to an array of dials, buttons and screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Japan’s rail system has a well-deserved reputation for being among the very best in the world. An extensive network of tracks moving an estimated 12 billion passengers each year with an on-time performance measured in the seconds makes Japanese rail a precise, highly reliable transportation marvel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Train conductors, drivers and station staff play an important role in the safe and efficient operation of the lines; a key aspect of which is the variety of physical gestures and vocal calls that they perform while undertaking their duties. While these might strike visitors as silly, the movements and shouts are a Japanese-innovated industrial safety method known as pointing-and-calling; a system that reduces workplace errors by up to 85 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Hiroshima train conductor pointing along the track.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-40789&quot; data-src=&quot;//assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/40789/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A Hiroshima train conductor pointing along the track. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesabbott1963/16265507746/in/photolist-cnCCJ5-9uvV8R-i7LA9-9T8C9J-5aTKED-cnCDgj-9iN18d-5soxmf-5sjbQZ-514RxT-62C3pm-6nqh3-mZhK2k-4EahY1-dvW1Fe-d8pYwL-s2YPWf-o6gcH-cnCDGu-cnCDuj-cnCCXC-4oeTwN-4oaPnc-3yJfX-x9vQmK-x9pdYo-8FvJhQ-mZhJbH-4P59Cx-521AF8-6RvFB3-KcT4m-3yJgjK-5qsqEj-69SfyU-7GMMbZ-eb12e-Fb853-4UTsh-4TG5h-4RmU9-77xn6j-6F5UrQ-Aqibnw-yr9DvF-yqr3bZ-qMjYLJ-qPsHVD-qPBRSM-wPyN3y&quot;&gt;James Abbott/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Known in Japanese as &lt;em&gt;shisa kanko&lt;/em&gt;, pointing-and-calling works on the principle of associating one’s tasks with physical movements and vocalizations to prevent errors by “raising the consciousness levels of workers”—according to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan. Rather than rely on a worker’s eyes or habit alone, each step in a given task is reinforced physically and audibly to ensure the step is both complete and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAveOgx70XE?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;In the rail context, when train drivers wish to perform a required speed check, they do not simply glance at a display. Rather, the speedometer will be physically pointed at, with a call of “speed check, 80”—confirming the action taking place, and audibly confirming the correct speed. For station staff who ensure the platform-side tracks are free of debris or fallen passengers, a visual scan alone is not sufficient. Instead, the attendant will point down the track and sweep their arm along the length of the platform—eyes following the hand—before declaring all clear. The process repeats as the train departs, ensuring no bags—or passengers—are caught hanging from the train’s closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It is such an integral part of Japanese transportation that direction boards at the Kyoto Rail Museum even feature characters in the classic point-and-call stance.&lt;/p&gt;

— Motohiko Sakazaki (@Tokyo_Seoul) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Tokyo_Seoul/status/832160431745617920&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The system is in place across a number of industries in Japan. Originally developed by the now-defunct Kobe Railroad Administration Bureau in the late Meiji Period (the early 20th century), pointing-and-calling is known to reduce workplace errors by up to 85 percent, according to one 1996 study. While some workers point-and-call more enthusiastically than others, even those who are more blasé benefit from the increased awareness that comes from physically reinforcing each task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;For such a simple but effective method of improving workers’ error rate, the system continues to find itself largely confined to Japan. Indeed, it is one of the many quirks of the Japanese workplace that fall flat with Western workers. In the case of pointing-and-calling, Japanese commentators have theorized that Western employees feel “silly” performing the requisite gestures and calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Guard on Shinkansen bullet train in Kyoto Station&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-40768&quot; data-src=&quot;//assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/40768/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Guard on Shinkansen bullet train in Kyoto Station &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Peter Adams/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;A notable exception is New York City’s MTA subway system, whose conductors have used a modified point-only system since 1996 after then Chief Transportation Officer Nathaniel Ford was fascinated by the point-and-call system during a business trip to Japan. In the MTA’s case, conductors point to a fixed black-and-white “zebra board” to confirm a stopped train is correctly located along the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;According to MTA spokeswoman Amanda Kwan, conductors were quick to adapt to the new system, and within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpkrIu2p_iM?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Japanese workers are also not immune to feeling self-conscious when it comes to pointing-and-calling, although with training it soon becomes an accepted part of the job. A spokesperson for Tokyo Metro noted in a statement that new employees “recognize pointing-and-calling as necessary for safe rail operations, and therefore do not feel embarrassment.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Streaming mogul Netflix claims &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is now a bigger competitor than other media companies like Game of Thrones and True Detective producer HBO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2018/q4/FINAL-Q418-Shareholder-Letter.pdf&quot;&gt;In a recent earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix said it earns around 10 percent of television screen time in the United States, though it averages less than that on mobile screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the company then talked up its ability to earn consumer screen time away from a &quot;very broad set of competitors,&quot; before adding that it also competes with (and loses to) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; more than HBO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a notable comparison that highlights not only how incredulously popular Epic's last-man-standing shooter has become, but also how its impact is now being felt by some of the biggest names outside of the games industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's easy to see why Netflix considers &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; a main rival. The free-to-play title is available on almost every platform imaginable, from consoles and PCs to smartphones, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/330297/Fortnite_hits_83M_concurrent_players.php&quot;&gt;hit 8.3 million concurrent players&lt;/a&gt; before Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time we checked, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/331480/Fortnite_just_passed_200_million_registered_users.php&quot;&gt;over 200 million registered users&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic continues to keep the game relevant by introducing new skins, weapons, and locations with the start of each new 'season.'&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Hironobu SUZUKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from graduate school of information engineering (M.S. in Information Engineering), have worked for several companies as a software developer and technical manager/director. I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;field-author=%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8+%E5%95%93%E4%BF%AE&amp;amp;search-alias=books-jp&amp;amp;text=%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8+%E5%95%93%E4%BF%AE&amp;amp;sort=relevancerank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven books&lt;/a&gt; in the fields of database and system integration (3 PostgreSQL books and 3 MySQL books).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a director of the Japan PostgreSQL Users Group (2010-2016), I organized the largest (non-commercial) technical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.jp/wg/shikumi/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seminar/lecture&lt;/a&gt; of PostgreSQL in Japan for more than six years, and also served as the program committee chair of the Japan PostgreSQL Conference in 2013 and as a member in 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuando era joven, vivió en Sudamérica por unos años. Recientemente, a veces vuelve a allí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I live in Dublin, Ireland. However, I am considering to relocate to another country again because of financial reason and personal activity. The first reason is simple. Taxes and rent are higher than expected, becoming poorer than when living in Japan. The second reason is my personal PostgreSQL activity. In short, the company I am currenty working is a very bad environment to do open source activities. So, I have to look for a new company that welcomes my activity of PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
