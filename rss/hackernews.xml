<title>SSH Handshake Explained</title>

<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;May 9, 2019&quot; class=&quot;blog-author&quot;&gt;May 9, 2019 by Russell Jones&lt;/time&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure Shell (SSH) is a widely used Transport Layer Protocol to secure connections between clients and servers. SSH is the underlying protocol that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravitational.com/teleport&quot;&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; uses to secure connections between clients and servers. Below is a relatively brief description of the handshake that occurs to establish a secure channel between a client and a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-exchange&quot;&gt;Version Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSH begins by both sides sending a version string to each other. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this part of the handshake, but it should be noted that most relatively modern clients and servers only support SSH 2.0 due to flaws in the design of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snailbook.com/faq/ssh-1-vs-2.auto.html&quot;&gt;version 1.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-exchange&quot;&gt;Key Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key exchange (sometimes called KEX) is used by the client and server to exchange information in public that leads to a secret shared by the client and server that an observer can not discover or derive from public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-exchange-initialization&quot;&gt;Key Exchange Initialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key exchange is kicked off by both sides sending a &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT&lt;/code&gt; message to each other with a list of cryptographic primitives they support with the order reflecting their preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptographic primitives are to establish the building blocks that will be used to perform the key exchange and then bulk data encryption. The table below lists of cryptographic primitives that Teleport supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: Teleport default cryptographic primitives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;elliptic-curve-diffie-hellman-initialization&quot;&gt;Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Initialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because both sides use the same algorithm to select cryptographic primitives out of the supported list, after the key exchange initialization, the key exchange can begin immediately. Since Teleport only supports Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), the key exchange begins by the client generating an ephemeral keypair (private and associated public key) and sending the server it’s public key in a &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worthwhile to emphasise that this keypair is ephemeral: it will only be used during the key exchange and disposed of afterwards. This makes a class of attack where an attacker passively records encrypted traffic with the hope of stealing a private key sometime in the future extremely difficult. It’s very difficult to steal something that simply no longer exists. This property is called forward secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gravitational.com/blog/images/2019/SSH-Handshake-Figure1.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;key exchange initialization&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Generation of the key exchange initialization message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;elliptic-curve-diffie-hellman-reply&quot;&gt;Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Reply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server listens for the &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT&lt;/code&gt; message, and upon receipt, generates its own ephemeral keypair. With the client’s public key and its own keypair, the server can generate the shared secret K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the server generates something referred to as the exchange hash H and signs it generating HS, see Figure (3) for more details. The exchange hash and its signature serves several purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the exchange hash includes the shared secret, it proves the other side was able to generate the shared secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The signature/verification loop of the exchange hash and signature allows the client to verify the server has ownership of the host private key and therefore the client is connected to the correct server (as long as the client can trust the corresponding public key, more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By signing the exchange hash, instead of signing the input to the exchange hash, the size of the data to be signed is substantially reduced and results in a faster handshake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange hash is generated by taking the hash (either SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512, depending on the key exchange algorithm) of the following fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/a49355c7e3f8fe157a85be2f77e6e269a0f89602/ssh/kex.go#L53-L58&quot;&gt;Magics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;. The client version, server version, clients &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEXINIT&lt;/code&gt; message, servers &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEXINIT&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server host public key (or certificate) &lt;code&gt;HPub&lt;/code&gt;. This value (and its corresponding private key HPriv) is typically generated during process initialization and not generated for every handshake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client public key &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server public key &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shared secret &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this information in hand, the &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY&lt;/code&gt; message can be constructed by the server from the ephemeral public key of the server &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, the host public key of the server &lt;code&gt;HPub&lt;/code&gt;, and the signature on the exchange hash &lt;code&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt;. See Figure (4) for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gravitational.com/blog/images/2019/SSH-Handshake-Figure2.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;security KEX hash generation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Generation of the exchange hash H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the client receives a &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY&lt;/code&gt;, it has everything needed to calculate the secret &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; and the exchange hash &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the key exchange has the client extract the host public key (or certificate) from &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY&lt;/code&gt; and verifies the signature of exchange hash &lt;code&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt; proving ownership of the host private key. To prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, once the signature is validated the host public key (or certificate) is checked against a local database of known hosts; if this key (or certificate) is not trusted the connection is terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever seen a message like below, it means that the the key presented is not in your local database of known hosts. A good way to avoid seeing this type of message is to use SSH certificates instead of keys (something that Teleport does by default), which allow you to simple store the CA in your local database of known hosts, and then all hosts signed by that CA are validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;The authenticity of host 10.10.10.10 (10.10.10.10)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:pnPn3SxExHtVGNdzbV0cRzUrtNhqZv+Pwdq/qGQPZO3.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: An SSH client asking to add a host key to the local database of known hosts. For OpenSSH that is typically &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/known_hosts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Generation of the ECDH KEX reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-keys&quot;&gt;New Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing remains before bulk data encryption can begin, both sides need to generate 6 keys: two keys for encryption, two initialization vectors (IV), and two for integrity. It’s not unreasonable to ask, what is the purpose of so many additional keys? Isn’t the shared secret K enough? It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s address the need for distinct keys for encryption, integrity, and IV. One of the reasons is due to how protocols like TLS and SSH have historically been constructed to allow negotiation of cryptographic primitives. Depending on the cryptographic primitives chosen, key re-use may not be an issue, but as &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/8081/using-the-same-secret-key-for-encryption-and-authentication-in-a-encrypt-then-ma&quot;&gt;Henrick Hellström points out&lt;/a&gt;, for the wrong choice (like AES-256-CBC and AES-256-CBC-MAC for confidentiality and authentication respectively), it can be disastrous. It should be noted that protocol designers are moving away from this type of agility to make protocols simpler and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s address the need for each type of key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption keys are used to ensure data confidentiality and are used with a symmetric cipher to encrypt and decrypt data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity keys are typically used with a message authentication code (MAC) to ensure an attacker does not manipulate the ciphertext. If an integrity check on the ciphertext does not exist, an attacker can manipulate the ciphertext being sent over the wire and you might decrypt something the sender did not send. This type of scheme is typically called &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/202/should-we-mac-then-encrypt-or-encrypt-then-mac&quot;&gt;Encrypt-then-MAC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that modern &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption&quot;&gt;AEAD ciphers&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravitational.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;38595d4b090a00155f5b557857485d564b4b50165b5755&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravitational.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;25464d44464d44171508554a495c14161510654a55404b56564d0b464a48&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; don’t actually use the derived integrity key for the MAC, they perform authentication internal to their construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialization vectors (IV) are typically random numbers used as input to a symmetric cipher. The purpose of an IV is to ensure that the same message encrypted twice does not result in the same ciphertext. The need for this property has famously been visualized by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_(ECB)&quot;&gt;ECB mode Tux image&lt;/a&gt;. How IVs have been used (and exploited) is an interesting topic in of itself that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/tls-nonce-nse/&quot;&gt;Filippo Valsorda has written about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, why do theys keys come in pairs? &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1139/what-is-the-purpose-of-four-different-secrets-shared-by-client-and-server-in-ssl&quot;&gt;As Thomas Pornin outlines&lt;/a&gt;, if only a single integrity key is used, an attacker can replay a record the client sent back to the client and the client would consider it valid. With multiple integrity keys (one for server to client, and another client to server), when the client performs the integrity check on the ciphertext, it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with an understanding of why we need these keys, let’s cover how they are generated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-7.2&quot;&gt;from the RFC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial IV client to server: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;A&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial IV server to client: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;B&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption key client to server: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;C&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption key server to client: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;D&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity key client to server: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;E&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity key server to client: &lt;code&gt;HASH(K || H || &quot;F&quot; || session_id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the hash algorithm is SHA{256, 384, or 512} depending on the key exchange algorithm with the || symbol implying concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these values are computed both sides send a &lt;code&gt;SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS&lt;/code&gt; to inform the other side that the key exchange is over and all future communication should occur using the new keys generated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gravitational.com/blog/images/2019/SSH-Handshake-Figure4.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;generating new ssh keys&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: Generation of the initial IV. Generation for the other keys is similar, replacing “A” and “B” with “C”, “D”, “E”, and “F” respectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point both sides have agreed upon cryptographic primitives, exchanges secrets, and arrived upon key material for the selected primitives and a secure channel that can provide confidentiality and integrity can be established between client and server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is how the SSH handshake establishes a secure connection between clients and servers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>They Might Never Tell You It’s Broken</title>
<link>https://pointersgonewild.com/2019/11/02/they-might-never-tell-you-its-broken/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pointersgonewild.com/2019/11/02/they-might-never-tell-you-its-broken/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a public service announcement (or maybe a reminder) for anyone working on a programming project that they already have, or intend to release to the public, be it as something open source, a pet project, or a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked on a few successful open source projects over the last 10 years. I would consider these projects successful in that they got hundreds of stars on GitHub and each attracted multiple open source contributors. I actually shut down one of these project&lt;span&gt; because reviewing pull requests alone was becoming a second unpaid job on top of my regular job, taking multiple hours out of my evenings after work, which became exhausting, but that’s a story for another post. What I want to tell you about today is &lt;/span&gt;something important, that I believe any developer should know, but I personally didn’t understand until I had been working on open source projects for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my PhD, I developed Higgs, an experimental JIT compiler for JavaScript written using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dlang.org/&quot;&gt;D programming language&lt;/a&gt;. I developed it on GitHub, completely in the open, and wrote about my progress &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointersgonewild.com/category/higgs/&quot;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty soon, the project had 300 stars on GitHub, a handful of open source contributors, and I was receiving some nice feedback. It made me happy to have so many people taking notice of my research work. As part of Higgs, I had written my own x86 machine code generator, which enabled it to do machine code pirouettes LLVM couldn’t. I did all my development on Linux, but had done my best to keep the code as portable as possible, and so, that code would work fine on MacOS as well, I had assumed. Unfortunately, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year into its development, Higgs had enough of a small community that it made sense to have create a chat room to exchange with other contributors and users. About a dozen people joined over the next two months. One day, someone I had been exchanging with on the chat room for two weeks reached out to me to signal a strange bug. They couldn’t get the tests to pass and were getting a segmentation fault. I was puzzled. They asked me if Higgs had MacOS support. I explained that I’d never tested it on MacOS myself, but I couldn’t see any reason why it wouldn’t work. I told this person that the problem was surely on their end. Higgs had been open source for over a year. It was a pretty niche project, but I knew for a fact that at least 40-60 people must have tried it, and at least 50% of these people must have been running MacOS. I assumed that surely, if Higgs didn’t run on MacOS at all, someone would have opened a GitHub issue by now. Again, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, it turned out, was that MacOS had more strict requirements for keeping the stack pointer aligned. This wasn’t difficult to fix. The more important lesson, that I didn’t understand until that point, is that you can’t count on the people trying your project to quickly and reliably signal bugs to you. Most of the time, if it doesn’t work, they won’t report the problem. There are a few reasons why this might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They assume that someone else has already reported the problem, and there would be no point in saying anything. The bigger your project, the more likely people are to assume that someone else has already reported the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They think the fault might be on their end, they may be confused and feel too embarrassed to reach out for help. Nobody wants to look stupid or get told to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM&quot;&gt;RTFM&lt;/a&gt;, and so, they choose silence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are just trying your project out of curiosity, and are in no way invested. They will find an alternative to your project, or go do something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a horrifying thought, but it could be that for every one person who opens an issue on GitHub, 100 or more people have already tried your project, run into that same bug, and simply moved on. So, what can you do? You can encourage people to report bugs. I visibly write in my GitHub README that reporting bugs is encouraged and welcome: “Please tell me if something is wrong, you’re helping me make this project better.” Another obvious thing that you can do is to have robust automated testing. Some continuous integration services can automatically test on both Linux and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, if you want your project to be successful, I think it’s important to try and put yourself in the user’s shoes. Every once in a while, try installing your software from scratch, along with all the dependencies. Ideally, you want your installation process to be as simple and frictionless as possible. If your software requires the user to perform 20 steps to get it running, you’ll be losing potential users even before they have a chance to figure out if it works on their system or not. In general, I find that writing software with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointersgonewild.com/2018/02/18/minimalism-in-programming/&quot;&gt;minimalist design philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, minimizing external dependencies as much as is reasonable to do so, will help you avoid bugs, and streamline your installation process.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I've not seen this before, not sure what to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I don't suppose it changes much/anything on how we optimise sites. It might add a bit of confusion as to who's the real site if you can get results like to show when you're trying to rank for someone elses brand name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are writing on behalf of the Canadian Society for Chronobiology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Changing our clocks twice a year has little benefit, economic or otherwise, so isn’t it time to stop this antiquated practice? The good news is that some provincial legislatures agree and are currently considering bills to adopt permanent time. As experts on biological rhythms, we support the switch to a permanent time. However, in doing so, we must adopt Standard Time (ST), not Daylight Savings Time (DST, or “summer time”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;There is general agreement that getting rid of the time switch twice a year would be a good idea. After time switches, particularly the “spring forward,” there are increased rates of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/daylight-saving-time-is-deadly-2018-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/10/26/can-daylight-saving-time-hurt-the-heart-prepare-now-for-spring&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart attacks, strokes&lt;/a&gt; and workplace injuries. So why does it matter whether we adopt permanent DST or permanent ST?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;All the processes happening in our bodies are co-ordinated by our biological clocks, located in our brains and all other organs. The argument in favour of permanent DST is that there would be more light in the evening. While this is true, we can’t change the number of hours of light in the day. More evening light means less morning light. But importantly, it’s the light in the morning that is most important in resetting our biological clocks. Consider this: If we all spent our time outdoors getting plenty of natural light, and could choose when to get up and go to sleep as our ancestors did, our internal clocks would be set by the sun so that we would tend to wake up at dawn, and then, depending on the time of year, stay awake for a while in the evening after dark. Our body clocks would be in sync with the sun clock. The problem is that we live in societies that force us to get up and go to work or school at times that we don’t get to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Chronobiologists, the name given to scientists who study biological timing, call this situation “social jet lag,” when the body clock doesn’t match the social clock. Just like the jet lag you get when you fly across time zones and find yourself out of sync with the new local time, social jet lag can cause many problems including disrupted sleep, increased risk of accidents, lower productivity at work and in school, and increased risk of negative health impacts. Permanent ST would move “social time” closer to our natural “body time,” while permanent DST would move social time further away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Can just one hour make such a big difference? We already have evidence from a huge natural experiment that we are all part of: the difference between people living on the western and eastern edges of any time zone. The sun moves continuously across time zones, but we are arbitrarily divided up into one-hour blocks. People on the western edge are forced to get up an hour earlier than people on the east, according to sun time. Analysis of health data from millions of people shows that people on the western edges of time zones get about 19 minutes less sleep every night than people on the east, and also have significantly higher rates of obesity, diabetes and heart attacks than people on the eastern edges. Even scarier, cancer rates significantly increase when the sunrise is later on the western edges. Permanent DST would make sunrise even later for everyone, while permanent ST would make sunrise closer to body time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Permanent DST was tried in the United States in the past century but was quickly repealed when the public found that waking up in the dark is hard, and energy savings were negligible. Let’s not repeat that failed experiment in Canada. Since Canadians live even further north, the challenge would be even more profound in our country. Recently, several provincial legislatures have considered stopping the switch, with a bill currently on the table in British Columbia, but in all cases the plan is to switch to DST, not ST.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Keystone pipeline shut after spilling 1.4M litres of oil in North Dakota</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-spils-over-1-million-litres-oil-north-dakota-1.5343509</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-spils-over-1-million-litres-oil-north-dakota-1.5343509</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
Authorities said Thursday that TC Energy's Keystone pipeline has leaked an estimated 1.4 million litres of oil in northeastern North Dakota since Wednesday, though the cause was still under investigation. (North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality/Taylor DeVries/AP)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;155&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An estimated 1.4 million litres of oil have spilled from TC Energy Corp.'s Keystone crude pipeline in North Dakota, state authorities said on Thursday, a major leak at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny of oil pipeline expansions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cause of the rupture has not yet been disclosed. But the initial estimate makes it one of the biggest onshore crude spills in the past decade and the largest for Keystone, according to U.S. Pipeline Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration (PHMSA) data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;inread-wrapper-id-22987210&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pipeline operator Calgary-based TC Energy has been seeking to expand its pipelines linking Western Canadian oil fields to U.S. refineries with its proposed Keystone XL project. The $6 billion US ($7.8 billion Cdn) project has faced regulatory and environmental hurdles despite backing by U.S. President Donald Trump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A nearly 10-year legal fight between TC Energy, formerly called TransCanada, and environmental activists has delayed development of the line that would run from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. A Nebraska court in August affirmed an alternative route through the state, raising hopes the project might proceed and provide badly needed transport for Alberta's crude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Wednesday, TC Energy said its 93.8 million litre-per-day (lpd) Keystone pipeline system to the United States was shut after a drop in pressure was detected. It said there were no injuries and it was investigating the cause of the breach near Edinburg, N.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company has not said when pipeline operations would restart, but told shippers that service to U.S. Midwest refiners would remain shut during the outage. The line could remain shut for at least a week, according to market sources on Thursday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TC Energy has begun using backhoes and vacuum trucks to recover the spilled oil, said Brent Nelson, an emergency response manager for Walsh County who visited the site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot; sizes=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344381.1572623497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keystone-pipeline.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At this time I would estimate 50 to 75 persons onsite working between two shifts.... They are focusing on oil recovery at this time and will then move to making repairs,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact amount of oil released will not be available until recovery has been completed, TC Energy said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a Keystone crude pipeline leak in rural South Dakota spilled nearly 1.04 million litres, PHMSA data showed. Earlier this year, Keystone was partially shut after leaking 6,800 litres of crude in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest release also affected a wetland area, a statement from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It [Keystone] went in during the 1990s. They've had a few spills ... more than you would hope to have on a line that's still fairly new,&quot; said Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust in Bellingham, Wash., a non-profit promoting pipeline safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keystone has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the U.S. than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010, according to a Reuters review in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketlink pipeline disrupted &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keystone outage also disrupted flows on the Marketlink pipeline, which has a capacity to flow 119 million lpd and is connected to Keystone, roiling oil prices at the delivery point for U.S. crude futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, TC Energy said on its website that the Marketlink system was not affected by the Keystone outage, which was shut from Hardisty, Alta., to Cushing and to Wood River-Patoka, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Thursday, sources said the rates on the Marketlink were reduced, with one source saying the line was operating at about 30 million lpd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, market intelligence firm Genscape said on Thursday afternoon that Marketlink shut from reduced rates at approximately 47 million lpd earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[This incident] underscores the structural issue plaguing the Canadian oil industry,&quot; said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While it is too soon to draw comparisons to last year's historic pricing disconnect, the stranded barrels may raise similar fears if the outage proves longer than historical precedents,&quot; Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC Energy said in a statement it would focus on cleaning up the spill and preparing to make Keystone pipeline repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sierra Club said the latest spill was an example of why the Keystone XL should not be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't yet know the extent of the damage from this latest tarsands spill, but what we do know is that this is not the first time this pipeline has spilled toxic tarsands, and it won't be the last.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the pipeline and Trump for supporting the pipeline extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders said he would shut down the existing pipeline if elected.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chrome 0-day exploit used in Operation WizardOpium</title>
<link>https://securelist.com/chrome-0-day-exploit-cve-2019-13720-used-in-operation-wizardopium/94866/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://securelist.com/chrome-0-day-exploit-cve-2019-13720-used-in-operation-wizardopium/94866/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky Exploit Prevention is a component part of Kaspersky products that has successfully detected a number of zero-day attacks in the past. Recently, it caught a new unknown exploit for Google’s Chrome browser. We promptly reported this to the Google Chrome security team. After reviewing of the PoC we provided, Google confirmed there was a zero-day vulnerability and assigned it CVE-2019-13720. Google has released Chrome version 78.0.3904.87 for Windows, Mac, and Linux and we recommend all Chrome users to update to this latest version as soon as possible! You can read Google’s bulletin by &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky endpoint products detect the exploit with the help of the exploit prevention component. The verdict for this attack is Exploit.Win32.Generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling these attacks Operation WizardOpium. So far, we have been unable to establish a definitive link with any known threat actors. There are certain very weak code similarities with Lazarus attacks, although these could very well be a false flag. The profile of the targeted website is more in line with earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://securelist.com/the-darkhotel-apt/66779/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DarkHotel&lt;/a&gt; attacks that have recently deployed similar false flag attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about CVE-2019-13720 and recent DarkHotel false flag attacks are available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting. For more information, contact: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intelreports@kaspersky.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-details&quot;&gt;Technical details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack leverages a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal. A malicious JavaScript code was inserted in the main page, which in turn, loads a profiling script from a remote site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122729/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_01.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122729/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1196&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94867&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redirect to the exploit landing page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main index page hosted a small JavaScript tag that loaded a remote script from hxxp://code.jquery.cdn.behindcorona[.]com/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script then loads another script named &lt;em&gt;.charlie.XXXXXXXX.js&lt;/em&gt;. This JavaScript checks if the victim’s system can be infected by performing a comparison with the browser’s user agent, which should run on a &lt;em&gt;64-bit&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;em&gt;Windows&lt;/em&gt; and not be a &lt;em&gt;WOW64&lt;/em&gt; process; it also tries to get the browser’s name and version. The vulnerability tries to exploit the bug in &lt;em&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/em&gt; browser and the script checks if the version is greater or equal to 65 (current Chrome version is 78):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122743/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_02.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122743/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1001&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94868&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome version checks in the profiling script (.charlie.XXXXXXXX.js)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the browser version checks out, the script starts performing a number of AJAX requests to the attacker’s controlled server (&lt;em&gt;behindcorona[.]com&lt;/em&gt;) where a path name points to the argument that is passed to the script (&lt;em&gt;xxxxxxx.php&lt;/em&gt;). The first request is necessary to obtain some important information for further use. This information includes several hex-encoded strings that tell the script how many chunks of the actual exploit code should be downloaded from the server, as well as a URL to the image file that embeds a key for the final payload and RC4 key to decrypt these chunks of the exploit’s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122755/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_03.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122755/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_03.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94869&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploitation chain – AJAX requests to xxxxxxx.php&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After downloading all the chunks, the &lt;em&gt;RC4&lt;/em&gt; script decrypts and concatenates all the parts together, which gives the attacker a new JavaScript code containing the full browser exploit. To decrypt the parts, the previously retrieved RC4 key is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122805/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_04.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122805/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;616&quot; height=&quot;99&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94870&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;One more version check&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser exploit script is obfuscated; after de-obfuscation we observed a few peculiar things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another check is made against the user agent’s string – this time it checks that the browser version is 76 or 77. It could mean that the exploit authors have only worked on these versions (a previous exploitation stage checked for version number 65 or newer) or that other exploits have been used in the past for older Chrome versions.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122818/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_05.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122818/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_05.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;678&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94871&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obfuscated exploit code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;There are a few functions that operate on the browser’s built-in &lt;em&gt;BigInt&lt;/em&gt; class, which is useful for doing 64-bit arithmetic inside JavaScript code, for example, to work with native pointers in a 64-bit environment. Usually, exploit developers implements their own functions for doing this by working with 32-bit numbers. However, in this case, &lt;em&gt;BigInt&lt;/em&gt; is used, which should be faster because it’s implemented natively in the browser’s code. The exploit developers don’t use all 64 bits here, but instead operate on a smaller range of numbers. This is why they implement a few functions to work with higher/lower parts of the number.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122829/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_06.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122829/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_06.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;429&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94872&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snippet of code to work with 64-bit numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many functions and variables that are not used in the actual code. This usually means that they were used for debugging code and were then left behind when the code was moved to production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of the code uses several classes related to a certain vulnerable component of the browser. As this bug has still not been fixed, we are not including details about the specific vulnerable component here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few big arrays with numbers that represent a shellcode block and an embedded PE image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis we have provided here is deliberately brief due to vulnerability disclosure principles. The exploit used a &lt;em&gt;race condition&lt;/em&gt; bug between two threads due to &lt;em&gt;missing proper synchronization&lt;/em&gt; between them. It gives an attacker an a &lt;em&gt;Use-After-Free (UaF)&lt;/em&gt; condition that is very dangerous because it can lead to code execution scenarios, which is exactly what happens in our case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploit first tries to trigger &lt;em&gt;UaF&lt;/em&gt; to perform an information leak about important 64-bit addresses (as a pointer). This results in a few things: 1) if an address is leaked successfully, it means the exploit is working correctly; 2) a leaked address is used to know where the heap/stack is located and that defeats the &lt;em&gt;address space layout randomization (ASLR)&lt;/em&gt; technique; 3) a few other useful pointers for further exploitation could be located by searching near this address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that it tries to create a bunch of large objects using a recursive function. This is done to make some deterministic heap layout, which is important for a successful exploitation. At the same time, it attempts to utilize a heap spraying technique that aims to reuse the same pointer that was freed earlier in the UaF part. This trick could be used to cause confusion and give the attacker the ability to operate on two different objects (from a JavaScript code perspective), though in reality they are located in the same memory region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploit attempts to perform numerous operations to allocate/free memory along with other techniques that eventually give the attackers an arbitrary read/write primitive. This is used to craft a special object that can be used with &lt;em&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FileReader&lt;/em&gt; together to perform code execution for the embedded shellcode payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122845/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_07.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122845/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;781&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94873&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;payload-description&quot;&gt;Payload description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final payload is downloaded as an encrypted binary (worst.jpg) that is decrypted by the shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122905/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_08.png&quot; class=&quot;magnificImage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/01122905/WizardOpium_CVE-2019-13720_08.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1021&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94874&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encrypted payload – worst.jpg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decryption, the malware module is dropped as updata.exe to disk and executed. For persistence the malware installs tasks in Windows Task Scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payload ‘installer’ is a RAR SFX archive, with the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File size: 293,403&lt;br/&gt;MD5: 8f3cd9299b2f241daf1f5057ba0b9054&lt;br/&gt;SHA256: 35373d07c2e408838812ff210aa28d90e97e38f2d0132a86085b0d54256cc1cd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive contains two files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both files were compiled at the same time, which if we are to believe the timestamp, was “Tue Oct 8 01:49:31 2019”.&lt;br/&gt;The main module (msdisp64.exe) tries to download the next stage from a hardcoded C2 server set. The next stages are located on the C2 server in folders with the victim computer names, so the threat actors have information about which machines were infected and place the next stage modules in specific folders on the C2 server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;81.403636363636&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a BuzzFeed News package on schools and social media surveillance. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/Schools%20And%20Surveillance&quot;&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the 1,300&lt;/strong&gt; students of Santa Fe High School, participating in school life means producing a digital trail — homework assignments, essays, emails, pictures, creative writing, songs they've written, and chats with friends and classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of it is monitored by student surveillance service Gaggle, which promises to keep Santa Fe High School kids free from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Fe High, located in Santa Fe, Texas, is one of more than 1,400 schools that have taken Gaggle up on its promise to “stop tragedies with real-time content analysis.&quot; It's understandable why Santa Fe's leaders might want such a service. In 2018, a shooter killed eight students and two teachers at the school. Its student body is now part of the 4.8 million US students that the for-profit &quot;safety management&quot; service monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A college student whose middle school used Gaggle told BuzzFeed News that the tool taught them that they would always be watched. “I feel like now I’m very desensitized to the threat of my information being looked at by people,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of in-house artificial intelligence and human content moderators paid about $10 an hour, Gaggle polices schools for suspicious or harmful content and images, which it says can help prevent gun violence and student suicides. It plugs into two of the biggest software suites around, Google’s G Suite and Microsoft 365, and tracks &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, including notifications that may float in from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts linked to a school email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle touts itself as a tantalizingly simple solution to a diverse set of horrors. It claims to have saved hundreds of lives from suicide during the 2018–19 school year. The company, which is based in Bloomington, Illinois, also markets itself as a tool that can detect threats of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“... Maybe it teaches students some lessons, but not the ones we want them to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;109.14003590664&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/search/projectid:46514-Gaggle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hundreds of pages of newly revealed Gaggle documentation&lt;/a&gt; and content moderation policies, as well as invoices and student incident reports from 17 school districts around the country obtained via public records requests, show that Gaggle is subjecting young lives to relentless inspection, and charging the schools that use it upward of $60,000. And it’s not at all clear whether Gaggle is as effective in saving lives as it claims, or that its brand of relentless surveillance is without long-term consequences for the students it promises to protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and caregivers have always monitored their kids. Sarah Igo, a professor of history at Vanderbilt University who studies surveillance and privacy, told BuzzFeed News, modern schools are often a de facto “training house for personhood.” But student surveillance services like Gaggle raise questions about how much monitoring is too much, and what rights minors have to control the ways that they’re watched by adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It just seems like maybe it teaches students some lessons, but not the ones we want them to learn,” Igo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Questionable content&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle is one of the biggest players in today’s new economy of student surveillance, in which student work and behavior are scrutinized for indicators of violence or a mental health crisis, and profanity and sexuality are policed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[There’s] a very consistent and long-standing belief that children have fewer rights to their own communications, and to their own inner thoughts and to their own practices,” Igo told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle uses an in-house, AI-powered filtering system to monitor everything that a student produces on their school account associated with Google’s G Suite or Microsoft’s 365 suite of tools. It scans student emails, documents, chats, and calendars, and compares what students write against a “blocked word list,” which contains profanity as well as references to self-harm, violence, bullying, or drugs. A Gaggle spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the list is regularly updated and “based on the language commonly used by children and adolescents for almost a decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service also runs images uploaded by students through an “Anti-Pornography Scanner” (also proprietary and powered by AI). Gaggle, citing the sensitivity of its proprietary information, declined to tell BuzzFeed News how these tools were trained, answer questions about the original training sets, or say whether Gaggle’s AI tools learn based on what students put into G Suite and Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many banned words and phrases on Gaggle’s list are &quot;suicide,&quot; &quot;kill myself,&quot; &quot;want to die,&quot; &quot;hurt me,” &quot;drunk,&quot; and &quot;heroin.&quot; Gaggle also commonly catches profanity — in 17 US school districts, about 80% of posts flagged by Gaggle within a particular school year were flagged for such words, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the list: LGBTQ-related words like &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;lesbian,&quot; and &quot;queer.&quot; When asked whether the company provides LGBTQ sensitivity training to safety representatives, Gaggle said that it coaches them in how to separate &quot;bias and personal opinion&quot; from content moderation decisions. It’s unclear if, in addition to antidiscrimination training, Gaggle educates moderators on the specific challenges that LGBTQ youth may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Gaggle’s company wiki, student emails are scanned in real time, and those that violate the rules are blocked from their intended recipients. Meanwhile, documents and files are moderated “after the fact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gaggle’s software flags student content for any reason at all, it passes the material to one of the Level 1 safety representatives, who number 125. If the first reviewer thinks there’s an imminent risk to student safety, Gaggle said, it is forwarded it to one of the group of 25 core “trained safety professionals.” These employees are responsible for flagging content to school administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle said that that its “trained” safety representatives “have degrees in fields such as criminal justice, psychology, communications, health administration, and education.” It’s unclear whether Gaggle was referring to its Level 2 safety representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle did not answer BuzzFeed News' list of specific questions about the training or qualifications required from its contract and staff safety representatives, respectively. It also didn’t specify how much content safety representatives are required to review each day and month. However, Gaggle wrote on its company wiki in 2017 that content moderators individually reviewed “over a million blocked student communications each month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Gaggle&amp;amp;t=Safety+Representative&amp;amp;jk=483adab0591bdd4c&amp;amp;sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvfJ3BvpBn-sV9u2ooigvcZnJJuggPknbxUMR5yDiR8BZi7XM0JTeCZQGSDt9FWaXcWQC8OySIppKtc6sGGXVHTZCE0kuPMpNqs-RAsUAu00p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Gaggle&amp;amp;t=Safety+Representative&amp;amp;jk=483adab0591bdd4c&amp;amp;sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvfJ3BvpBn-sV9u2ooigvcZnJJuggPknbxUMR5yDiR8BZi7XM0JTeCZQGSDt9FWaXcWQC8OySIppKtc6sGGXVHTZCE0kuPMpNqs-RAsUAu00p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;descriptions&lt;/a&gt; for “Level 1 Safety Representatives,” these positions are filled by contract employees paid about $10 an hour. These safety representatives do not need experience in counseling or adolescent health, or even working with children, teens, or young adults, though familiarity with current slang and social media is encouraged. A &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Gaggle&amp;amp;t=Safety+Representative&amp;amp;jk=483adab0591bdd4c&amp;amp;sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvfJ3BvpBn-sV9u2ooigvcZnJJuggPknbxUMR5yDiR8BZi7XM0JTeCZQGSDt9FWaXcWQC8OySIppKtc6sGGXVHTZCE0kuPMpNqs-RAsUAu00p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;job description posted to Indeed notes&lt;/a&gt; that they are typically capped at 38 hours per week, just shy of what an employee would need to be considered full time and legally entitled to benefits. Gaggle declined to answer whether its Level 1 safety representatives receive benefits or insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle also declined to detail its safety representative hiring process and training program, but &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Gaggle&amp;amp;t=Safety+Representative&amp;amp;jk=483adab0591bdd4c&amp;amp;sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvfJ3BvpBn-sV9u2ooigvcZnJJuggPknbxUMR5yDiR8BZi7XM0JTeCZQGSDt9FWaXcWQC8OySIppKtc6sGGXVHTZCE0kuPMpNqs-RAsUAu00p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.sg/Interview/Gaggle-Interview-Questions-E672713.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=Student+Safety+Representative+-+Level+I&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reviews posted to Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; suggest they are not particularly rigorous. One person claimed that an online application added to a waiting list, and shortly after, they received a job offer and emails &quot;explaining how everything works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle analyzes student data and funnels its conclusions to a “Safety Management Dashboard.” School administrators with access can see rule violations alongside numeric IDs of the students who committed them. The dashboard includes a “Top Concerns” graph, which displays a scoreboard of students who have violated Gaggle’s rules over a particular time period. Administrators can expand the graph into a list that ranks the students within their district based on how often they violate Gaggle’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaggle ranks rule-breaking incidents according to three tiers of severity. A “violation” may include any use of language that breaches Gaggle rules, including false positives, like sending song lyrics or quoting from a book. “Questionable Content” includes material that’s concerning but not an imminent threat to student safety. This category could include cyberbullying or sending “professional pornographic images or files,” according to Gaggle. School officials are alerted when these occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “Possible Student Situation” is the most severe type of content violation. According to Gaggle, it represents an “immediate threat” to the safety of students, including “student-produced pornography, violence, suicide, rape, or harmful family situations.” If a Gaggle safety representative determines that a piece of pornography is student-produced, Gaggle automatically send the file to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of child pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle operates by a “three strike rule,” meaning that mild rule violations could be flagged to school administrators if a student does it repeatedly. For instance, if a student said “fuck” three times, school officials would be alerted. According to Gaggle, students who commit three strikes have their account privileges limited until a school official gives those privileges back. It’s unclear if a student would lose email privileges in these situations, since it can be necessary for communicating with teachers and completing assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Roberts, a UCLA professor and a scholar in digital content moderation, told BuzzFeed News that people should be skeptical about the effectiveness of policies based on“three strikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They're talking about 'three strikes' rules and other kinds of quasi-judicial language,” Roberts said. “These framings, we know that three strikes rules are not particularly held in high regard in places like California where they came from. And yet they're being replicated and seamlessly built into the architecture of these platforms and their whole logic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A solution in search of a problem”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytics designed to make track of massive troves of student data might seem like useful tools for school administrators. However, critics worry that schools are teaching students to accept sweeping forms of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My sense about this particular suite of products and services is that it's a solution in search of a problem,” Roberts said, “which is to say that the only way that the logic of it works is if we first accept that our children ought to be captured within a digital system, basically, from the time they're sentient until further notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle claims that its tool promotes a sense of “digital citizenship.” However, documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show that students often don’t understand that their work and communications are being surveilled until they violate the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, a frank talk about the proper use of a school-issued email account is enough to make students realize that emails are not private,” an email obtained from a school in St. Mary Parish in Louisiana says. “We've discovered that some students don't realize that they are using inappropriate language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are children. They're supposed to be exploring and learning and have the ability to make mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;83&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Gilliard, an English professor at Macomb Community College who studies privacy and inequality, told BuzzFeed News he believes that Gaggle’s definition of “citizenship” is misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teaching young people that you should exist online to the extent that you're palatable to companies, or future employers, I think is worrisome,” Gilliard said. “These are children. They're supposed to be exploring and learning and have the ability to make mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle told BuzzFeed News that it “recommends” school districts get permission from parents and students before they use the company’s tools to monitor them. It also provides a choice to opt out, but since it works with required school services (email accounts, etc.), it’s unclear how that would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a student opts out of Gaggle, then they would not be able to use the school-provided technology and would have to use their personal email addresses for their school work — and that personal email would not be scanned by Gaggle,” a Gaggle spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. In other words, once a school district buys Gaggle services, students don’t have a school-friendly alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Life saved”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With suicide one of the leading causes of death for people under 18 and school shootings an ever-present concern, Gaggle’s student surveillance has a clear appeal to school administrators. While the federal government struggles to pass even elementary gun control, Gaggle is something schools &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; easily pay for. Gaggle is also a more toned-down option than, say, proposals from politicians to arm teachers or install armed police in schools. When a robust team of student counselors is financially impossible, and when school administrators believe something is better than nothing, Gaggle becomes a feasible choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, experts doubt whether Gaggle, or any kind of surveillance, is an adequate or appropriate response to adolescent suicide and school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody would nearly line up behind the thing that saving a young person's life is worth it,” Igo said. “But this is always, always the argument that is made about any kind of surveillance that has to do with crime or destruction or violence. We cannot just simply turn over when that explanation comes along. We need to think about the consequences of using these kinds of surveillance technologies on students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to think about the consequences of using these kinds of surveillance technologies on students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;101&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Gaggle’s central selling points is that it saves hundreds of lives each year from suicide. For the 2018–19 school year, it claimed that it prevented 722 students from committing suicide. When asked to explain, Gaggle said that out of the 52,000 references to suicide and self-harm it flagged, 6,000 were serious enough that Gaggle called the school “immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of those, 722 were so specific that we identify them as a ‘life saved,’” Gaggle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what Gaggle meant by “specific,” a company spokesperson said, “(a) that they have heard back from the district that a life was saved, or (b) that what the student wrote included a clear and definitive plan, i.e. the means to commit suicide, the specific place and time as to when they would be taking their lives, and the reason for it, or (c) both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle’s claim is tough to verify, especially since its system is very sensitive in flagging text as indicating possible thoughts of suicide and self-harm. Between July 2018 and June this year, for example, Gaggle flagged 447 cases of “questionable content” and 31 “possible student situations,” including possible suicides, in one Illinois school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 500 pages of emails from the school district, many of the documents flagged by Gaggle appear creative or expository. Items flagged for a demonstrating a risk of suicide or self-harm often had titles like “poem portfolio,” “Possible Poems ???” “Narrative Essay,” and “Narrative/Common App College Entry Essay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things [Gaggle is] teaching is not to share things, which is presumably the opposite of what many mental health professionals would say,” Igo said. If a student is afraid of being interviewed by school administrators, they may shut themselves off from adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear, based on the emails alone, whether Gaggle was a helpful tool in assisting vulnerable students. In several email chains, teachers and administrators were already aware that the child was struggling and were in touch with the parents of the students in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's a little bit cynical to wave [student suicides] in front of people to try to get them to buy in,” Roberts said. “I have more faith in relationships that could be built locally and interpersonally than far-removed through content moderators and through for profit revenue driven systems in terms of thinking about the safety of children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle claims that its safety representatives moderate content “24/7 every day of the year.” If Gaggle flags an imminent threats of suicide between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. Central time, a safety representative will try to alert school administrators by phone. If they can’t reach anyone, safety representatives are told to call local police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn't want a stranger poring over the communications and engagement of my children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;70&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel Fasulo, a psychologist at NYU Langone specializing in adolescent mental health, said that escalating a student’s mental health treatment by hospitalizing them or calling the police can be risky. If poorly timed, these escalations could worsen a student’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it really helped to escalate, we would escalate all situations,” Fasulo said. “The reality is that there are what's called iatrogenic effects in health care, which is a negative impact as a result of receiving treatment. It's not necessarily bad treatment, per se, but it's just treatment that increases the various symptoms you're trying to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasulo said that tools like Gaggle could be helpful in flagging suicidal ideation, but noted that it’s likely best used by a team of human clinicians and counselors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it's done right, I don't actually think there's anything inherently wrong with [Gaggle],” Fasulo said. “It just has to be done well, and it can't be used as the end-all, be-all — which I think people are often looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doing right by students isn’t easy, or cheap. Gaggle, like any platform whose success requires ongoing growth, faces issues similar to Facebook and Twitter when it comes to moderating at scale. AI-dependent moderation is clunky, and good moderators require training, reasonable pay, and emotional support. These are all things that impact a company’s bottom line. Beyond this is the issue of student privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roberts expressed concern at the policy of having a human being reviewing every piece of content that could be flagged by Gaggle’s internal AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That seems like a gross mismatch right there too,” Roberts said. “I wouldn't want a stranger poring over the communications and engagement of my children. But I wouldn't want it taking place fully online anyway. Because you know it again, it poses so many questions that I think the tools themselves are ill-equipped to respond to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We can't even get on board to funding school lunches”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaggle is not cheap. Invoices, letters of intent, and receipts from 17 cities show that the company charges school districts tens of thousands of dollars for its services each academic year. Depending on how many students were in the district, and how many premium services a school were to choose to use, annual fees could range from about $12,000 to more than $60,000 for a single academic year. (Gaggle’s contracts prohibit it from using &quot;district data&quot; or &quot;student records&quot; for targeted advertising during or after an agreement period, and it’s required to delete that data when the period ends.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2019/07/using-title-iv-funds-secure-student-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to trade publication SmartBrief&lt;/a&gt;, schools can tap into a hefty amount of federal money to pay for student surveillance services like Gaggle. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nassp.org/policy-advocacy-center/resources/essa-toolkit/essa-fact-sheets/title-iv-21st-century-schools/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Under Title IV of the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)&lt;/a&gt;, school districts may use more than $30,000 of federal money, according to need, in order to fund various, vaguely defined initiatives. Schools that receive more than $30,000 under ESSA must dedicate at least 20% of the money in order to fund a &quot;well-rounded&quot; education, at least 20% on &quot;safe and healthy&quot; activities for students, and some undefined amount of money toward &quot;technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts said that she feared tools like Gaggle could be used disproportionately as a stand-in for a larger staff of counselors at poorly funded school districts. She said that human support services like these could build relationships and trust with students and perhaps prevent issues from escalating rather than simply responding to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this is a question of values, and it's a question of how we value our young people. It's a question of where we collectively as a society want to spend money,” Roberts said. “We can't even get on board to funding school lunches, and yet we're going to give massive amounts of money to enrich this company that is spying on our kids.” ●&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray_vs_cray.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-271&quot; title=&quot;cray_vs_cray&quot; alt=&quot;cray_vs_cray&quot; src=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray_vs_cray-300x159.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;159&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part two (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/non-von-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see previous attempt&lt;/a&gt;) of my ongoing series in ‘computational necromancy,’ I’ve spent the last year and a half or so constructing my own 1/10-scale, binary-compatible, cycle-accurate Cray-1. This project falls purely into the “because I can!” category – I was poking around the internet one day looking for a Cray emulator and came up dry, so I decided to do something about it. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitsavers.org/pdf/cray/2240004C_CRAY-1_Hardware_Reference_Nov77.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cray-1 hardware reference manual&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be useful enough that implementing most of this was pretty straightforward. The Cray-1 is one of those &lt;em&gt;iconic&lt;/em&gt; machines that just makes you say “Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘s&lt;/em&gt; a super computer!” Sure, your iPhone is 10X faster, and it’s completely useless to own one, but admit it . . you really want one, don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cray-1A Architecture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get down to specs – What is this bad boy running? The original machine ran at a blistering 80 MHz, and could use from 256-4096 kilowords (32 megabytes!) of memory. It has 12 independent, fully-pipelined execution units, and with the help of clever programming, can peak at 3 floating-point operations per cycle. Here’s a diagram of the overall architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray_architecture.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-197&quot; title=&quot;cray_architecture&quot; alt=&quot;cray_architecture&quot; src=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray_architecture.gif&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fairly RISC-y design, with 8 64-bit scalar (S) registers , 8 64-bit/64-word vector (V) registers, and 8 24-bit address (A) registers. Rather than a traditional cache, it uses a ‘software-managed’ cache with an additional 64 64-bit words (T registers) and 64 24-bit words (B registers). There are instructions to transfer data between memory and registers, and then register-to-register ‘compute’ instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest aspects of this machine is that everything is fully pipelined. This machine was designed to be &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, so if you’re careful, you can actually get one (or more) instruction every cycle. This has some interesting implications – there’s no ‘divide’ instruction, for instance, because it can take a variable amount of time to finish. To perform a divide, you need to first compute the ‘reciprocal approximation’ (something we *can* do in exactly 13 cycles, it turns out) of the denominator value, and then perform a separate multiply of that result with the numerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vector instructions are particularly cool. A vector Add operation might take only 5 cycles to start producing results (remember, each vector can hold 64 values, so it takes 5 + 64 cycles to finish adding). Why wait for it to finish though? We can take the result output from the adder, and “chain” it straight into another vector unit (say a multiplier). And *that* only takes another 10 cycles or so, so we can chain &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; result into yet another unit (say, reciprocal approximation). Now, rather than waiting for the first operation to finish, we’re computing up to 3 floating point calculations &lt;em&gt;per cycle.&lt;/em&gt; Clever programmers could sustain about 2 floating point operations per cycle, or 160 million instructions per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/vector_chaining.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200&quot; title=&quot;vector_chaining&quot; alt=&quot;vector_chaining&quot; src=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/vector_chaining-300x239.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;239&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vector Chaining in Action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual design was implemented in a Xilinx Spartan-3E 1600 development board. This is basically the biggest FPGA you can buy that doesn’t cost thousands of dollars for a devkit. The Cray occupies about 75% of the logic resources, and all of the block RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/spartan3_1600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-205&quot; title=&quot;spartan3_1600&quot; alt=&quot;spartan3_1600&quot; src=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/spartan3_1600-300x263.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;263&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a spiffy Cray-1A running at about 33 MHz, with about 4 kilowords of RAM. The only features currently missing are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Interrupts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Exchange Packages (this is how the Cray does ‘context-switching’ – it was intended as a batch-processing machine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I/O Channels (I just memory-mapped the UART I added to it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ever find some software for this thing (or just get bored), I’ll probably go ahead and add the missing features. For now, though, everything else works sufficiently well to execute small test programs and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started building this, I thought “Oh, I’ll just swing by the ol’ Internet and find some groovy 70’s-era software to run on it.” It turns out I was wrong. One of the sad things about pre-internet machines (especially ones that were primarily purchased by 3-letter Government agencies) is that practically no software exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***** If Anyone has any Cray-1 software, please contact me!! If you work at one of the National Labs, please take a look!****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After searching the internet exhaustively, I contacted the Computer History Musuem and they didn’t have any either. They also informed me that apparently SGI destroyed Cray’s old software archives before spinning them off again in the late 90’s. I filed a couple of FOIA requests with scary government agencies that also came up dry. I wound up e-mailing back and forth with a bunch of former Cray employees and also came up *mostly* dry. My current best hope is a guy I was able to track down that happened to own an 80 MB ‘disk pack’ from a Cray-1 Maintenance Control Unit (the Cray-1 was so complicated, it required a dedicated mini-computer just to boot it!), although it still remains to be seen if I’ll actually get a chance to try to recover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a real software stack (compilers, operating systems, etc.), the machine isn’t terribly useful (not that it would be all that useful if I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have software for it). All of the opcodes and registers for the Cray-1 are described in Base-8 (octal), so I did at least write a little script to translate octal machine code into the hexadecimal format that Xilinx’ tools require. All of my programming so far has just been in straight octal machine-code, just assembling it in my head. I have started work on re-writing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/cray/CAL/2240000B_Prelim_CAL_RefMan_Dec75.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CAL Assembler&lt;/a&gt;, but that may take awhile, as it employs some tricky parsing that I’m having to teach myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makin’ it look pretty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of owning a Cray-1 if it doesn’t *look* like a Cray-1?? Unfortunately, the square-shaped FPGA board isn’t conducive to actually making it the traditional “C” shape, but I think it turned out pretty cool anyway. My friend Pat was nice enough to let me use his CNC milling machine to cut out the base pieces (and help with assembly). It’s a combination of MDF, balsa wood and pine. There was also a healthy dose of blood, sweat and tears (and gorilla glue) involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some random photos from the build process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/img_2311.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-268&quot; title=&quot;img_2311&quot; alt=&quot;img_2311&quot; src=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/img_2311-150x150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The pleather couch-seat really ties the whole thing together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.mattel.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4032107&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Computer Engineer Barbie&lt;/a&gt; has an appropriate place to sit down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is awesome! How can I build my own?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much a work-in-progress, but if you’d like to join in the fun, feel free! All you need is a copy of the RTL (almost all Verilog-2001) and a Spartan-3 1600 or equivalent FPGA board. The code is likely riddled with bugs and questionable implementation choices at this point, so on the off-chance anyone actually downloads this, feel free to lend a hand and send me any bug fixes you might make!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray1.zip&quot;&gt;Cray1.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally had some more time to work on this. The updated code includes faster implementations of the multiplier units (it runs up to 50 MHz on my Spartan-3E!), as well as support for context-switching (“Exchange Packages”). There is still no support for I/O channels, but the 8-bit memory-mapped UART was replaced with full 64-bit UART.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as improved hardware, this release also includes a lot of progress on the software front. It includes a more-or-less complete implementation of the CAL assembler, re-written in Python, as well as a utility for generating Xilinx-friendly memory initialization files. Writing in CAL is *way* easier than writing in octal machine code. Code is also included for a simple BASIC-like language I’ve started playing around with (basically useless, as it doesn’t output valid Cray-1 assembly yet, but possibly interesting to look at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an archaic DOS-compatible Cray X-MP simulator surfaced! It’s a single-processor simulator (the X-MP models where essentially 2-4 processor Cray-1s), so it is essentially just a Cray-1 sim, but it does work pretty well if you just want something to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it here!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisfenton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cray1_r2.zip&quot;&gt;Cray1_r2.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is now hosted on Google code, and is morphing into a single-CPU Cray X-MP with a working copy of COS 1.17: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/cray-1x/&quot;&gt;The Cray-1X Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**UPDATE 2**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read about the journey to recover a working copy of the COS operating system &lt;a title=&quot;Cray-1 Digital Archeology&quot; href=&quot;http://www.chrisfenton.com/cray-1-digital-archeology/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;COS Recovery&quot; href=&quot;http://www.chrisfenton.com/cos-recovery/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
