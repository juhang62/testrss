<title>CBD and hemp are now legal in the U.S</title>
<link>https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into law. Among other things, this new law changes certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa L.&lt;/em&gt;), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it will no longer be an illegal substance under federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important for the FDA and our commitment to protect and promote the public health is what the law &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; change: Congress explicitly preserved the agency’s current authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;amp;C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In doing so, Congress recognized the agency’s important public health role with respect to all the products it regulates. This allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re aware of the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including cannabidiol (CBD). This increasing public interest in these products makes it even more important with the passage of this law for the FDA to clarify its regulatory authority over these products. In short, we treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as we do any other FDA-regulated products — meaning they’re subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance. This is true regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act. To help members of the public understand how the FDA’s requirements apply to these products, the FDA has maintained a &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm421168.htm&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; with answers to frequently asked questions, which we intend to update moving forward to address questions regarding the Agriculture Improvement Act and regulation of these products generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the proliferation of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived substances, the FDA will advance new steps to better define our public health obligations in this area. We’ll also continue to closely scrutinize products that could pose risks to consumers. Where we believe consumers are being put at risk, the FDA will warn consumers and take enforcement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we continue to be concerned at the number of drug claims being made about products not approved by the FDA that claim to contain CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds. Among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. This is the same standard to which we hold any product marketed as a drug for human or animal use. Cannabis and cannabis-derived products claiming in their marketing and promotional materials that they’re intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases (such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes) are considered new drugs or new animal drugs and must go through the FDA drug approval process for human or animal use before they are marketed in the U.S. Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective. This deceptive marketing of unproven treatments raises significant public health concerns, as it may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&amp;amp;C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because both CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary supplements. Under the FD&amp;amp;C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these into the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement that we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active ingredients in any drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll take enforcement action needed to protect public health against companies illegally selling cannabis and cannabis-derived products that can put consumers at risk and are being marketed in violation of the FDA’s authorities. The FDA has sent &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm484109.htm&quot;&gt;warning letters&lt;/a&gt; in the past to companies illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer. Some of these products were in further violation of the FD&amp;amp;C Act because they were marketed as dietary supplements or because they involved the addition of CBD to food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds remain subject to the FDA’s authorities and requirements, there are pathways available for those who seek to lawfully introduce these products into interstate commerce. The FDA will continue to take steps to make the pathways for the lawful marketing of these products more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pathways include ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market with therapeutic claims a human or animal drug that is derived from cannabis. For example, in June 2018, the FDA approved a drug, &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611046.htm&quot;&gt;Epidiolex&lt;/a&gt;, that contains cannabis-derived CBD for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. That approval was based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, which gives prescribers confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, pathways remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Although such products are generally prohibited to be introduced in interstate commerce, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient in a food or dietary supplement. We are taking new steps to evaluate whether we should pursue such a process. However, the FDA would only consider doing so if the agency were able to determine that all other requirements in the FD&amp;amp;C Act are met, including those required for food additives or new dietary ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that some foods are derived from parts of the hemp plant that may not contain CBD or THC, meaning that their addition to foods might not raise the same issues as the addition of drug ingredients like CBD and THC. We are able to advance the lawful marketing of three such ingredients today. We are announcing that the agency has completed our evaluation of three &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ConstituentUpdates/ucm628910.htm&quot;&gt;Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/a&gt; (GRAS) notices related to hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil and that the agency had no questions regarding the company’s conclusion that the use of such products as described in the notices is safe. Therefore, these products can be legally marketed in human foods for these uses without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make disease treatment claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the substantial public interest in this topic and the clear interest of Congress in fostering the development of appropriate hemp products, we intend to hold a public meeting in the near future for stakeholders to share their experiences and challenges with these products, including information and views related to the safety of such products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use this meeting to gather additional input relevant to the lawful pathways by which products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds can be marketed, and how we can make these legal pathways more predictable and efficient. We’ll also solicit input relevant to our regulatory strategy related to existing products, while we continue to evaluate and take action against products that are being unlawfully marketed and create risks for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we recognize the potential opportunities that cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds could offer and acknowledge the significant interest in these possibilities. We’re committed to pursuing an efficient regulatory framework for allowing product developers that meet the requirements under our authorities to lawfully market these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China hacked HPE, IBM and then attacked clients</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-hpe-ibm-exclusive-idUSKCN1OJ2OY</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-hpe-ibm-exclusive-idUSKCN1OJ2OY</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and IBM, then used the access to hack into their clients’ computers, according to five sources familiar with the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20181221&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1337472023&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEEBJ1TD&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;Signs for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. cover the facade of the New York Stock Exchange November 2, 2015.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacks were part of a Chinese campaign known as Cloudhopper, which the United States and Britain on Thursday said infected technology service providers in order to steal secrets from their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cybersecurity firms and government agencies have issued multiple warnings about the Cloudhopper threat since 2017, they have not disclosed the identity of technology companies whose networks were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it had no evidence that sensitive corporate data had been compromised. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said it could not comment on the Cloudhopper campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses and governments are increasingly looking to technology companies known as managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely manage their information technology operations, including servers, storage, networking and help-desk support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper targeted MSPs to access client networks and steal corporate secrets from companies around the globe, according to a U.S. federal indictment of two Chinese nationals unsealed on Thursday. Prosecutors did not identify any of the MSPs that were breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both IBM and HPE declined to comment on the specific claims made by the sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IBM has been aware of the reported attacks and already has taken extensive counter-measures worldwide as part of our continuous efforts to protect the company and our clients against constantly evolving threats,” the company said in a statement. “We take responsible stewardship of client data very seriously, and have no evidence that sensitive IBM or client data has been compromised by this threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HPE said in a statement that it had spun out a large managed-services business in a 2017 merger with Computer Sciences Corp that formed a new company, DXC Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The security of HPE customer data is our top priority,” HPE said. “We are unable to comment on the specific details described in the indictment, but HPE’s managed services provider business moved to DXC Technology in connection with HPE’s divestiture of its Enterprise Services business in 2017.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DXC Technology declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not comment on reports about specific cyber events and hacking groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to confirm the names of other breached technology firms or identify any affected clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources, who were not authorized to comment on confidential information gleaned from investigations into the hacks, said that HPE and IBM were not the only prominent technology companies whose networks had been compromised by Cloudhopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper, which has been targeting technology services providers for several years, infiltrated the networks of HPE and IBM multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months, according to another of the sources with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer, and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers were persistent, making it difficult to ensure that networks were safe, said another source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has dealt with some infections by installing new hard drives and fresh operating systems on infected computers, said the person familiar with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper attacks date back to at least 2014, according the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment cited one case in which Cloudhopper compromised data of an MSP in New York state and clients in 12 countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States. They were from industries including finance, electronics, medical equipment, biotechnology, automotive, mining, and oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One senior intelligence official, who declined to name any victims who were breached, said attacks on MSPs were a significant threat because they essentially turned technology companies into launchpads for hacks on clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By gaining access to an MSP, you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers,” said the official. “Call it the Walmart approach: If I needed to get 30 different items for my shopping list, I could go to 15 different stores or I could go to the one that has everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. Officials with the U.S. Justice Department and the Chinese embassy in Washington could not be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British government spokeswoman declined to comment on the identities of companies affected by the Cloudhopper campaign or the impact of those breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A number of MSPs have been affected, and naming them would have potential commercial consequences for them, putting them at an unfair disadvantage to their competitors,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,&quot; Sen. Ron Wyden said in a statement. | AP Photo/Cliff Owen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in hot water with Congress following new revelations about his company's data-sharing practices, with some senators saying he may have misled Congress when he testified this year about protecting the privacy of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Zuckerberg told us that this kind of nonsense would end and it didn’t,&quot; Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said Wednesday. &quot;Now the first time, you can argue it’s a mistake, but the second time, it’s a choice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-continued&quot;&gt;Story Continued Below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Squaring his comments with the facts is very hard,&quot; said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his congressional testimony in April, Zuckerberg assured lawmakers that “we don't sell data to anyone.” But The New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night that Facebook has long had financially beneficial agreements with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix and Spotify that allowed them to gain access to people’s timelines, friend lists, private messages and other data — at times without the users’ knowledge or expressed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers didn't say whether the CEO should face consequences. Instead, Democrats and Republicans talked up the need for privacy legislation to regulate how Facebook and other companies collect, store and share consumer data — even though the two parties have yet to coalesce around a single legislative proposal or set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outgoing Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said the details of Facebook's data-sharing arrangements provide &quot;even more ammunition for doing a privacy bill early next year.&quot; Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), his replacement, told POLITICO to &quot;count on hearings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When companies repeatedly lie to Congress and the American people about what they do with our messages, location, likes and everything else, Congress has a duty to do something about it,&quot; Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the eye-popping details in the Times’ lengthy investigation: Facebook granted Netflix and Spotify the ability to read users' private messages, and maintained agreements to trade data with Huawei and Yandex, companies whose connections to the Chinese and Russian governments, respectively, have raised national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnerships included a data-sharing deal with Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has criticized Facebook's privacy practices, though Apple said it was not aware it had special access, according to the Times. Facebook later identified the New York Times itself as one partner, saying it allowed users to see recommendations from Facebook friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new revelations were especially galling to lawmakers in light of Zuckerberg’s two days of congressional testimony this spring. He asserted that Facebook gives users control over how their data is used and whether to erase it, and pledged that the company would make privacy settings easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s beyond obvious at this point that social media platforms are simply not up to the task of voluntarily ensuring the privacy and security of their users,&quot; said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), himself a former telecom executive and investor. &quot;Congress must step in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) agreed. &quot;It has never been more clear. We need a federal privacy law,&quot; he said. “They are never going to volunteer to do the right thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times story also puts more pressure on the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees companies’ adherence to their privacy promises and is already investigating a different Facebook data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTC has leverage through a 2011 consent decree in which Facebook promised to notify consumers and gain their consent before sharing information beyond their privacy settings. Now &quot;the credibility of those big promises and the agency’s capacity to function effectively as a privacy authority&quot; are at stake as Facebook's privacy woes pile up, said William Kovacic, who served as chairman of the FTC from 2008 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another agency veteran said the emerging details about how Facebook handles data and runs its business could also fuel antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The latest revelations make the case for a breakup of Facebook stronger,&quot; Tim Wu, a former FTC senior adviser and now a Columbia Law School professor, told POLITICO. &quot;The case for antitrust action has often been triggered by evidence that agencies can’t control a company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m shocked that Facebook committed these violations while under FTC consent decree, without any apparent sense that they have to follow the law, even while on parole,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook downplayed the nature of its data-sharing partnerships, saying they allowed users to access their Facebook profiles on devices and platforms from other companies, such as Apple and Amazon, and enabled people to engage with Facebook friends on outside services, such as Spotify and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission, nor did they violate our ... settlement with the FTC,&quot; Facebook's director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-partners/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also regarded these partners as extensions of itself because they committed to abide by its privacy guidelines, according to the Times report, and therefore the company felt it did not need users' permission before sharing their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the revelations are further inflaming Facebook's problems in Washington, which have been building for months following a series of data breaches as well as reports about how Russian operatives have used the social network to interfere in U.S. elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously Facebook is making this up as they’re going along,&quot; said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). &quot;They’re not giving us all the information that we had been told that we were going to receive in terms of the compromise of the privacy of Americans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kyle Daly, Cristiano Lima and Nancy Scola contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Analysis of 2018 Hacker News “Who Is Hiring” Job Posts</title>
<link>https://letstalkalgorithms.com/analysis-of-2018-hacker-news-who-is-hiring-job-posts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letstalkalgorithms.com/analysis-of-2018-hacker-news-who-is-hiring-job-posts/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-19-at-7.41.56-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Image showing all the locations from the Hacker News Who is Hiring Job Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you are an avid Hacker News user, you would know that there's a hiring comment thread during the start of every month called, &lt;code&gt;Who is Hiring&lt;/code&gt;. Hundreds of companies from across the world post job posts as comments to that thread every month hoping to find potential employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other readers, HN users tend to be more technology focussed, so I thought analyzing the job posts would give some insight into how 2018 in software recruiting has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of data, so I decided to focus only on the below parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locations with most Jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Work - Number of  job posts which allow remote work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visa - Number of job posts which sponsor visa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles - Top roles that are being hired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills - Popular required skill set across all job postings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have scraped all the 12 months of job posts(comments on who is hiring threads) in 2018 using the firebase API and a golang hacker news wrapper library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;locations&quot;&gt;Locations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out all the locations in a job post, I used &lt;code&gt;geotext&lt;/code&gt; ,  a python module which gives you a list of places from the text. After aggregating results from all 12 months job posts, I used Google Places API to get latitude and longitude for each city and visualized on a map using &lt;code&gt;AmCharts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2o18, the top 10 locations with most jobs are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  &quot;San Francisco&quot;: 2922
   &quot;New York&quot;: 1746
   &quot;London&quot;: 1236
   &quot;Toronto&quot;: 660
   &quot;Boston&quot;: 558
   &quot;Los Angeles&quot;: 498
   &quot;Berlin&quot;: 474
   &quot;Seattle&quot;: 456
   &quot;Austin&quot;: 324
   &quot;Amsterdam&quot;: 318
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly San Francisco beats most cities by a wide margin and close second is New York. Below are all cities with the number of job posts in that city in 2018 visualized on an interactive map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-work&quot;&gt;Remote Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the evolving phenomena since the last 2-3 years is companies embracing remote work. More companies are offering remote work and are being flexible with partial remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a regular expression search in each job post text to see if a job offers remote work or not. The chart below shows the number of job posts that offer remote work. Total number of job posts in each month is usually around 800-1000, so if you are looking for &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; a good 12% on average allow remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/remote-jobs-each-month--4-.svg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visa&quot;&gt;Visa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley and most of the technology companies in the USA rely heavily on foreign workers. With the arbitrary suspension of premium process for H1-B applications, most employees can't easily move and companies can not hire at the same speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a regular expression search for the term &lt;code&gt;Visa&lt;/code&gt; and the below chart shows the number of job postings that sponsors visa. As you the jobs which sponsor visa is less than 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/jobs-with-visa-sponsorsh--2--1.svg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;roles&quot;&gt;Roles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are more engineering positions than anything else, I did a count of all roles including the level in software engineers and below is the chart that represents number of job posts over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    &quot;Engineering Manager&quot;: 271,
    &quot;Principal Software Engineer&quot;: 25,
    &quot;Product Designer&quot;: 243,
    &quot;Product Manager&quot;: 425,
    &quot;Program Manager&quot;: 35,
    &quot;QA&quot;: 353,
    &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;: 818,
    &quot;Software Engineer&quot;: 2975,
    &quot;Staff Software Engineer&quot;: 10
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/jobs-with-titles--2--1.svg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really curious to see the popular skills over the last year. I generated the count by using a pre-defined dictionary of skills and below are the counts and a chart that represents the top skills asked for in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: After posting to HN, I realized some of the skills has false positives during regex search, so until they are updated, please consider these as direction in general, but not as the accurate count. Apologize for the inconsistent data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: The regex false positive issue is resolved. Fixed it by using word boundaries on regex &lt;code&gt;\\b&amp;lt;word&amp;gt;\\b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;html, 277
python, 273
.net, 216
react, 211
php, 124
docker, 92
android, 89
c, 80

perl, 7
lua, 6
mysql, 6
haskell, 5
apache, 4
vuejs, 4
objective-c, 2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/skills-in-2018--1-.svg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;perks&quot;&gt;Perks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just curiously I checked for number of job posts which offered free lunch over the last year and below is the chart representing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://letstalkalgorithms.com/content/images/2018/12/jobs-with-free-lunch-1.svg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helped in giving you some insight into the job posts on Hacker News. I will open source the code used to analyze all this after cleaning up by this weekend, currently it's a combination of Golang, Python, Amcharts, Highcharts to analyze and visualize the hiring data. Follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/venkateshthallam&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; to get notified when the repo is up or check back this post over the weekend for the repo link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update :&lt;/strong&gt; Added a very initial version of the code &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2BAP70f&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to help people understand the process/logic i followed for the blog post. Running the code doesn't automatically generates the charts, but hoping to get the repo into that stage in sometime, so it could be reused for other kinds of analytics projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We should replace Facebook with personal websites</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a freshman in high school, in the year of our lord 2002, I made a website called “Jason’s Site.” While a website named after myself and devoted to updates about my own life was unspeakably vain for the time, it was also quite forward looking: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.members.tripod.com/aggro88&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The site&lt;/a&gt; has a news feed, an “about me” page, and an email mailing list for people to receive updates. I intended for it to be funded by reader donations. It had a section for Flash videos and photos, a guestbook, and a “friends” page that was literally a list of my friends. It had an ill-advised but nonetheless prescient “hot or not” section that featured photos of my friends and acquaintances and predated both Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg’s original idea for the social network, called “FaceMash.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnj5qz/my-10-year-old-geocities-site-was-accused-of-hosting-pornbut-i-saved-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;updated the site regularly and obsessively&lt;/a&gt; for about three months, and then never returned to it. The site was embarrassing then and is embarrassing now, but abandoning it was a terrible mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stopped updating my website, I didn’t stop posting online. I just found other places to do it. I made a Xanga, and then a LiveJournal, and then a MySpace. So did all my friends. We posted every day—photos from trips, friend and relationship drama, complaints about teachers, inside jokes. We were conditioned to post because only the weird kids did not post. There were rarely any consequences for posting the intimate details of our lives; the only consequences came from not participating in the online conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of Xanga, LiveJournal, or MySpace managed to figure out how to monetize the stuff we posted in any meaningful sense. There were no targeted advertisements, and none of us ever thought about “personal data” or what could be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the day that the University of Maryland gave incoming freshmen “@umd.edu” email addresses. This was a monumental day not because we were going to be in college soon—it was important because the email address would allow us to create Facebook accounts, since Facebook still required users to verify their profiles with a university email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were first assigned our email addresses (a few weeks before high school graduation), I was in Ms. Brosnan’s genetics class, which had a handful of computers in the back of the classroom. About a dozen people crowded around the computers and started signing up for Facebook. We all did it, one after the other. We began looking for our friends who had already gone to college. And then, we kept posting, just like we had on MySpace. That was 12 years ago, and most of us haven’t stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it’s not clear to me why we were all so excited to get a Facebook. We were already all on the same social networks. But someone—a popular kid, probably—decided that we were going to use Facebook, and so we all used Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook gets a lot of credit for “disrupting” social media and for turning MySpace into a worthless piece of garbage, but millions upon millions of teenagers and young adults were already sharing every aspect of their lives on other social networks, and on their own websites. Facebook had the good fortune of being new, slightly different, and exclusive. It was even luckier to come to power shortly before the rise of the smartphone. I guess what I’m saying is that Facebook isn’t really all that much better or more convenient than having your own website, or sending emails or chats. But for some reason, Facebook (and Instagram) are where we post now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a subtext of the #deleteFacebook movement that has nothing to do with the company’s mishandling of personal data. It’s the idea that people who use Facebook are stupid, or shouldn’t have ever shared so much of their lives. But for people who came of age in the early 2000s, sharing our lives online is second nature, and largely came without consequences. There was no indication that something we’d been conditioned to do would be quickly weaponized against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has of course become something much larger than a single website, and has, despite its flaws, &quot;helped connect the world&quot; for better or worse. But Facebook tapped into a trend that was already happening—it didn't invent the idea of letting people put stuff about their lives online, it just monetized it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about my own Facebook use, I think often about that first website I made, and how that site served the exact same purpose then that Facebook does now. My original sin wasn’t making a Facebook account, it was abandoning my own website that I controlled (the original site was hosted on Tripod, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd pay for web hosting.) All these years later, maybe it’s time to update Jason’s Site.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dear Developer, the Web Isn&amp;#039;t About You</title>
<link>https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re back to building sites that are not for everyone - huge, bloated sites, running fragile imperative code on the users local device. We have started to explicitly say &quot;I think you should have this level of tech, processing power, and bandwidth before I think you're eligible to use my site&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because we want to have our fun with technology. Because we don't want to think about &quot;edge case&quot; user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Edge case&quot; is, to be frank, a phrase that should be banned from all developer conversations (and then tattooed onto the forehead of anyone who continues to use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say &quot;Edge Case&quot; we mean &quot;Stress Case&quot;. In their book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-real-life&quot;&gt;Design for Real Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meyerweb.com/&quot;&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarawb.com/&quot;&gt;Sara Wachter-Boettcher&lt;/a&gt; point out that what we glibly call an &quot;edge case&quot; is normally an enormously stressful event for a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often accompanies high emotions, stress, physical problems, financial problems, etc. When we discount and dismiss the &quot;edge case&quot;, we're actually saying &quot;I don't care about that particular user's stressful situation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One succinct example I saw recently was an American chap trying to use an airline website while holidaying in SE Asia. His flight had been cancelled and he were trying to rebook. However, due to terrible internet connectivity in his location the site just wasn't loading - it was trying to pull down huge amounts of images and JS that were simply not happening on that connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.3670886075949&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/webperf?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#webperf&lt;/a&gt; in Cambodia: Yesterday I tried to book a domestic flight through various booking platforms and airline sites. Gave up after an hour and called a travel agent to book at a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
— Holger Bartel (@foobartel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foobartel/status/946299864551276544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ended up calling a travel agent via telephone and rebooking. How much of an utter failure is your website if your drive someone off it and into another company's hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine if that user had been able to disable Javascript and images and just have the HTML delivered. It wouldn't have been pretty, but it would have &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered about this, and went to check out the website in question.It turns out that no, you can't. The website is fully JS-driven. If you disable JS then you just get a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same theme, here's another example. An Angular JS app, failing because of flaky airport wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.7457627118644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Your fancy AngularJS apps are all very nice until you're trying to check in for a flight on flaky wifi: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/eTEXHE5XL2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/eTEXHE5XL2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are real situations, for real people. And these are only the ones that are reported, because the people in the stress situations are web professionals. How many thousands, millions, of interactions occur every day that no one reports because they're &quot;just&quot; regular users?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Slack closes account of an Iranian user living in Canada</title>
<link>https://twitter.com/a_h_a/status/1075510422617219077</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://twitter.com/a_h_a/status/1075510422617219077</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in Canada
No ties to Iran
No teammates in Iran!

If using slack is against US sanctions, the same applies to google, twitter, facebook...

Basically, we should ethnically profile people and stop giving services to certain ethnicities.

Tomorrow, Iranians can’t ride the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Max Planck Society Discontinues Agreement with Elsevier</title>
<link>https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/505</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/505</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The President and scientific council members of the Max Planck Society (MPS), one of the world’s largest research performing organizations, counting 14,000 scientists who publish 12K new research articles a year—around 1500 of which in Elsevier journals, have mandated the Max Planck Digital Library to discontinue their Elsevier subscription when the current agreement expires on December 31, 2018. With this move the Society joins nearly 200 universities and research institutions in Germany who have already cancelled their individual agreements with Elsevier in the course of 2016 and 2017 and affirmed their support of the national licensing framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Projekt DEAL&lt;/a&gt;, led by the German Rector’s Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the untenably increasing cost of access to scholarly journals and, more importantly, the stifling effect of the antiquated paywall system on the research process, Projekt DEAL was established to negotiate nationwide &lt;a href=&quot;http://esac-initiative.org/guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt; as a means to transition from the current subscription system to one based on open access publishing models that enable complete and immediate access to the latest research for scholars and citizens alike, free of cost or other barriers. “DEAL is fully in line with the objectives of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/mission/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;OA2020 Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which is strongly supported by the Max Planck Society,’ emphasized MPS President Martin Stratmann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformative agreement that the DEAL negotiators propose to the major academic publishers is a “publish and read” model covering open access publication of all scholarly articles by authors affiliated with German institutions and, at the same time, grant reading access for German institutions to the publisher’s entire portfolio of electronic journals still behind paywalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As no sustainable offer according these fundamental criteria has been forthcoming from the publisher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projekt-deal.de/elsevier-news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;negotiations with Elsevier were suspended last July&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers at the 200 institutions supporting the DEAL negotiations have consequently foregone access to the Elsevier platform and are broadly making use of alternative routes for their research needs. The Max Planck Digital Library has already set in place mechanisms to address the content needs of its researchers when Elsevier shuts off access at the beginning of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The system of scholarly publishing today is a relic of the print era, and we want to activate a real paradigm shift in order to finally utilize the opportunities of the digital age”, says Gerard Meijer, director at Max Planck Society’s Fritz Haber Institute and a member of the DEAL negotiation team. In a strong show of support for the DEAL negotiations, 13 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrk.de/press/press-releases/press-release/meldung/researchers-resign-editorship-of-elsevier-journals-4237/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;prominent Max Planck Society scientists resigned from their positions as editors&lt;/a&gt; and members of the editorial and advisory boards of Elsevier journals in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Transformative agreements are one of the primary strategies for driving large scale transition of scholarly publishing to open access and are increasingly being adopted by the scores of international supporters of our global Open Access 2020 Initiative”, says Ralf Schimmer, Deputy General Manager of the Max Planck Digital Library. ”As both producers and consumers of the research articles circulated through their journal platforms, we have the leverage to demand a system that meets the needs of our researchers, and by adopting these transformative agreements, we will be able to achieve our Society’s goal of publishing the vast majority of our researchers’ articles open access in a matter of a few short years. We have already accomplished such deals with some of the most relevant publishers to Max Planck researchers, such as Springer Nature, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics Publishing. Further publishers will follow in 2019.”&lt;/p&gt;
