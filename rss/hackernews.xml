<title>Boeing Believed a 737 Max Warning Light Was Standard</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/business/boeing-737-max-warning-light.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Boeing began delivering its 737 Max to customers in 2017, the company believed that a key cockpit warning light was a standard feature in all of the new jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But months after the planes were flying, company engineers realized that the warning light worked only on planes whose customers had bought a different, optional indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In essence, that meant a safety feature that Boeing thought was standard was actually a premium add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing detailed its initial confusion about the warning light in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130431&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; released on Sunday, adding new details to what was already known about the flawed design and introduction of the 737 Max, its best-selling jetliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The initial lack of knowledge about the feature’s functionality, along with the delayed disclosure, add to the concern about Boeing’s management of the Max’s design. The revelations add to Boeing’s mounting problems, which include frayed relations with airlines and customers, multiple federal investigations, growing financial costs and the remaining work to get the Max flying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The warning light notifies pilots of a disagreement in the sensors that measure which direction the plane is pointed, a potential sign of a malfunction. This light could have provided critical information to the pilots on two flights that crashed shortly after takeoff in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In both doomed flights — Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — preliminary investigations suggest that there were problems with these so-called angle of attack sensors early in the flights, activating new anti-stall software that sent the planes into unrecoverable nose-dives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The cockpit of a Boeing 737 Max plane. The 737 Max has been grounded for more than a month, after an Ethiopian Airlines crash, as Boeing works on software fixes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abhirup Roy/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the disagree alert worked only on planes with an optional indicator that displays the readings from the angle of attack sensors, Boeing said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Because only 20 percent of customers had purchased the optional indicator, the warning light was not working on most of Boeing’s new jets. Neither Lion Air nor Ethiopian had the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After discovering the lapse in 2017, Boeing performed an internal review and determined that the lack of a working warning light “did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation,” it said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As a result, Boeing said it did not inform airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration about the mistake for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Only after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October did Boeing discuss the matter with the F.A.A. The company then conducted another review and again found the missing alert did not pose a safety threat, and told the F.A.A. as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing and the F.A.A. put out public updates late last year that described the warning light as available only if the optional indicator had been purchased as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But neither statement made it clear that Boeing had intended for the disagree alert to be standard in all planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sngw6j&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1eoytci&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/us/lion-air-crash-cockpit-promo-1542393182522/lion-air-crash-cockpit-promo-1542393182522-articleLarge.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;What the Lion Air Pilots May Have Needed to Do to Avoid a Crash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;The rapid series of steps that may have been needed to save the plane were not in the manual, and the pilots had not been trained on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. said on Sunday that Boeing briefed it on the confusion in November, and that it deemed the issue to be “low risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“However, Boeing’s timely or earlier communication with the operators would have helped to reduce or eliminate possible confusion,” the F.A.A. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The anti-stall system, created to compensate for the Max’s large new engines, will push down the nose of the plane if the angle of attack sensors indicate the plane is dangerously close to stalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the system relied on only one of the two angle of attack sensors, introducing a potential single point of failure into a critical flight system. And the anti-stall system was also changed late in the design process to make it much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Airlines and pilots were not informed about the system until the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Boeing explained to pilots in one meeting how systems on the Max worked, the company said that the disagree alert would function on the ground. In the late November meeting, Boeing told pilots for American Airlines (which had bought the add-on) that their disagree alert would have notified them of problems before takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We were told that if the A.O.A. vane, like on Lion Air, was in a massive difference, we would receive an alert on the ground and therefore not even take off,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union representing American Airlines pilots. “That gave us additional confidence in continuing to fly that aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But in the last several weeks, Boeing has been saying something different. Mr. Tajer said the company recently told American pilots that the system would not alert pilots about any sensor disagreement until the aircraft is 400 feet above the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sngw6j&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1eoytci&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/business/boeing-737-max-8-flaws-1553903212386/boeing-737-max-8-flaws-1553903212386-articleLarge.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing’s Automated System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A Boeing spokesman confirmed this, stressing that the disagree alert does not work on the ground, and thus could not have alerted the Lion Air pilots to a faulty sensor before takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Tajer said Boeing seemed to have “provided information that was not accurate” and said the pilots have asked for clarification from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Tajer, who is also a 737 pilot, said he was concerned that Boeing did not seem to fully grasp how every aspect of the Max worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You better start knowing things about the airplane you’re building and selling because my life and the passengers that I carry safely across the globe depends on it,” Mr. Tajer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Lion Air crash also spurred Boeing to notify Southwest pilots about the disagree light. “We thought it worked,” said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Pilots’ Association. “If they knew it in 2017, why did we get to nearly the end of 2018 until the manual was changed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the months after the Lion Air crash, Boeing quietly worked to appease some customers, according to a person briefed on the matter. In several instances, it activated the angle of attack indicator for free, which then turned on the disagree alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The 737 Max has been grounded for more than a month, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing is working on a software fix that it plans to submit to the F.A.A. soon, in hopes that the Max can return to flight later this summer. The update will make the anti-stall system less powerful and reliant on both sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing is also developing a separate software update that will unlink the disagree alert from the angle of attack indicators, which will also be installed before the Max can fly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Canada Border Services seizes lawyer&amp;#039;s phone, laptop for not sharing passwords</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As more people travel with smartphones loaded with personal data, concern is mounting over Canadian border officers' powers to search those phones — without a warrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The policy's outrageous,&quot; said Toronto business lawyer, Nick Wright. &quot;I think that it's a breach of our constitutional rights.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His thoughts follow a personal experience. After landing at Toronto's Pearson Airport on April 10, he said the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) flagged him for an additional inspection — for no stated reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright had just returned from a four-month trip to Guatemala and Colombia where he studied Spanish and worked remotely. He took no issue when a border services officer searched his bags, but drew the line when the officer demanded his passwords to also search his phone and laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright refused, telling the officer both devices contained confidential information protected by solicitor-client privilege.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said the officer then confiscated his phone and laptop, and told him the items would be sent to a government lab which would try to crack his passwords and search his files.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122107.1557086810!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/nick-wright-nicks-rocche-chavajay-in-san-pedro-la-laguna-guatemala.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my view, seizing devices when someone exercises their constitutional right is an affront to civil liberty,&quot; said Wright who's still waiting for the return of his phone and laptop. Meanwhile, he said he has spent about $3,000 to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officers can search your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CBSA-FOI-Docs.pdf&quot;&gt;According to the CBSA&lt;/a&gt;, it has the right to search electronic devices at the border for evidence of customs-related offences — without a warrant — just as it does with luggage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If travellers refuse to provide their passwords, officers can seize their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBSA said that between November 2017 and March 2019, 19,515 travellers had their digital devices examined, which represents 0.015 per cent of all cross-border travellers during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 38 per cent of those searches, officers uncovered evidence of a customs-related offence — which can include possessing prohibited material or undeclared goods, and money laundering, said the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4311888.1556906736!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/canada-syria-migrants.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;According to the Canada Border Services Agency, its officers have the right to search any goods crossing the border without a warrant -- including electronic devices.  (Mark Blinch/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the laws governing CBSA searches have existed for decades, applying them to digital devices has sparked concern in an era where many travellers carry smartphones full of personal and sometimes very sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of lawyers across Canada argue that warrantless digital device searches at the border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lawyers-canada-warrantless-smartphone-searches-customs-act-1.4247036&quot;&gt;are unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;, and the practice should be stopped or at least limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The policy of the CBSA of searching devices isn't something that is justifiable in a free and democratic society,&quot; said Wright who ran as a Green Party candidate in the 2015 federal election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's appalling, it's shocking, and I hope that government, government agencies and the courts, and individual citizens will inform themselves and take action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Out of date' laws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer advocacy group, OpenMedia is already taking action. It has launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://borderprivacy.ca/?utm_source=nom&amp;amp;utm_medium=slideshow&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=7169&amp;amp;utm_term&amp;amp;tdid=2104&quot;&gt;online and ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; to raise awareness about digital border searches and pressure the federal government to update the rules that govern them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These laws are incredibly, incredibly out of date,&quot; said OpenMedia privacy campaigner Victoria Henry. &quot;The way they treat our digital devices are as mere goods and that's the same classification as a bag of T-shirts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to see separate border rules for digital devices which stipulate reasonable grounds for a search. Henry also said those rules must be clearly laid out to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to have clear and transparent policies and mechanisms for recourse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122182.1556907917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/openmedia-ad-border-phone-search.JPG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;An example of an ad that OpenMedia plans to run, starting in June on the Vancouver Skytrain. (submitted by OpenMedia)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government says that its current policies are both reasonable and necessary to keep Canadian borders secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSA officers are directed to disable any internet connection and only examine content that is already stored on a device, said Scott Bardsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that digital searches &quot;should not be routine&quot; and that &quot;officers may only conduct a search if there are multiple indicators that evidence of contraventions may be found on a device.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said, in his case, no rationale was provided why his phone and laptop needed to be examined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were no factors that I'm aware of that would justify the searches.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Respect for privacy'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Safety spokesperson Bardsley also said that CBSA officers understand the importance of solicitor-client privilege and are instructed not to examine documents that fall within that scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CBSA officers are trained to conduct all border examinations with as much respect for privacy as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said that wasn't his experience. Instead, the officer he dealt with neither expressed knowledge of, nor responded to his concerns that his laptop and phone contained solicitor-client privileged documents, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;His response was only to demand the passwords to access both.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bardsley said that if travellers have issues or concerns, they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;submit a complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the CBSA. He added that the government is investing $24 million to enhance oversight by creating an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;independent review body&lt;/a&gt; for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright has already submitted his complaint to the CBSA which includes a demand for the immediate return of his phone and laptop, plus compensation for having to temporarily replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when he gets them back, his battle may not be over; Wright is now considering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it's important that we all stand up for our civil liberties and our charter rights,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch: What border officers can search on your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Access Economy: Why the Normal Distribution Is Vanishing (2015)</title>
<link>https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: although I originally wrote this as a stand-alone post, it may make sense to think of it as Part Two of a series, beginning with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/02/02/the-rise-of-the-access-economy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Rise of the Access Economy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.500924214418&quot;&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-market-demand-curve-definition-equation-examples.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a classic exercise&lt;/a&gt; that we often encounter in business school, or elsewhere in higher education: the professor proposes, “I have two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert this Saturday night. All of you should write down on a piece of paper the maximum amount they’d be willing to pay for these tickets, then turn them in, and we’ll look at the distribution of those prices.” The idea is that from there, a promoter should be able to determine the optimal price (or sets of prices) to charge in order to maximize their sales.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;661&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/t_concert-2/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;600,313&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;t_concert&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700?w=600&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-661 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700&quot; alt=&quot;t_concert&quot; srcset=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png 600w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=150 150w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what typically happens is we see a distribution of numbers get passed in. Some are willing to pay lots, others not so much, and a bunch of people lie somewhere in the middle. We often see these numbers form something like a Gaussian distribution, or as it’s known to the general public, a ‘Normal Distribution’. Why do we see this distribution a lot? And why is it called ‘Normal’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Editor’s note: I play fast and loose here with what a ‘Normal’ distribution technically means here. If you’re mathematically inclined, kindly replace the words Normal and Gaussian with ‘Unscientific Lumpy Middle’ and the points should still hold just fine.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this distribution all over the place: in nature, in business, in life. If you’ve taken high school biology, you’ve probably encountered this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason why the normal distribution pops up so much: it represents the sum of some number of component factors. If you’ve played the game Settlers of Catan, you’ll be very familiar with this phenomenon: the outcome of the total roll of the dice, which represents the sum of one die plus the other, follows an approximately normal distribution. If you were rolling five dice instead of two (like in Yahtzee), you’d see this distribution more clearly. If you’re dealing with hundreds or thousands of factors (like human genes), you see normal distributions arise for things like our height. Even when some of these factor are inter-dependent, as is certainly the case with our genetics, we still reliably encounter these distributions: whenever we encounter the sum of many factors, there they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;620&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/dice_sum_probabilities/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=700&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;500,375&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Picasa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1387418310&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;dice_sum_probabilities&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=700?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=700?w=500&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-620 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=700&quot; alt=&quot;dice_sum_probabilities&quot; srcset=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg 500w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=150 150w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dice_sum_probabilities.jpg?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should make sense that our stated prices for these Taylor Swift tickets should follow a distribution like this: you could think of it as a sum of many factors. How much did you like &lt;em&gt;1989&lt;/em&gt;? How much disposable income do you have? How far would you have to travel? What are your other options? Would you have friends who would go with you? And so forth. We can generalize this example to our preferences and choices generally: the decisions we make whenever we spend something (money, time, opportunity, etc) represent the sum of many factors. Suppose you’re shopping for a new car: the distribution of new car prices aren’t quite symmetrically Gaussian (there’s a long tail towards the high end), but it’s still Normal-ish. If you’re looking for a car as a young person, you’ll have a certain set of factors you consider – cost, value, practicality, style. As you grow up, these factors will change, but the decision will remain multifactorial in nature – many of your preferences will evolve, but along a similar set of variables. Some of us buy luxury cars, others buy the cheapest that they can, and most of us are in the big fat middle – like rolling two dice and landing somewhere between a 4 and a 10. It won’t happen every time, but it’ll happen most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just one problem with this principle: it’s vanishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these three situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You’re looking to buy a new smartphone. What does your demand distribution look like? Is it normally distributed? Absolutely not. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that if you’re in the market for a smartphone, you fall into one of two very clear cut categories. Either: a. you’ve decided that your new phone is a very important item in your life, so you’re going to buy the nicest phone available at whatever price. (Usually this means an iPhone, although some flagship Android phones qualify for this category.) Or, b. you’ve decided that just about every phone out there is ‘good enough’ and is more than adequate for your needs, so you’ll go with whatever one costs $0 with your existing wireless contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You have twenty minutes of free time to spend reading things on the internet. How will you choose to allocate your attention? Odds are, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;24.652777777778&quot;&gt;Chances are good that your next twenty minutes will fall into one of two categories. Either: a. you go to a very specific destination site that you had in mind, with content that you will not find anywhere else and that you know exactly where to find. This could be a high-end news source like the New York Times; it could also be a small, niche site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratechery.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt;. But either way they’re a destination site – you’ve chosen explicitly that they, and precisely they, are what you’re going to read. Or, b. you don’t choose anything at all; instead you had to Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc and just browse through whatever’s posted there. Often it’s content with broad, mass appeal like Buzzfeed or Vox that no one is looking for directly, but many are happy to click and read.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. You’re a recent college graduate trying to decide where you’ll live. How will you make this decision? Will your options and preferences be normally distributed? Probably not. Odds are, your decision looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;654&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/live_where_3/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1186,618&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;live_where_3&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=700&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-654&quot; src=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=481&amp;amp;h=250&quot; alt=&quot;live_where_3&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=481&amp;amp;h=250 481w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=960&amp;amp;h=500 960w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=78 150w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=156 300w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=400 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that your decision will fall into one of two categories. Either: a. you’re trying to break into the film industry, so you’re overwhelmingly drawn towards LA. Or you’re trying to join a tech startup, so might be drawn to the Bay area. Or for any number of reasons. you just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to live in New York. And you’re willing to put up with all kinds of horrible side effects in order to live in that exact right place. Or, b. You will move anywhere where you get a job, or get into grad school, or where your girlfriend is moving – it’s effectively a single-variable decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t normal distributions at all. They’re totally different – they’re bifurcated distributions where one factor is dominating over all of the other factors. Either you care about X, or you don’t. Either you care about Y, or you don’t. And what used to be the happy middle – the fat part of the normal distribution, where most of the demand is supposed to lie – is all of a sudden quite sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world seems to be steadily moving in this direction: from one where our demands and preferences are normally distributed to one dominated by these weird, bifurcated, two-tier balances. Why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hunch is this: &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he world’s shift from Normal, Gaussian distributions of demand towards bifurcated, two-tiered distributions is a natural consequence of our shift from a world governed by scarcity to one governed by abundance. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world governed by scarcity – which is the one we’re used to thinking about, and the one described in our economics textbooks – it makes &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; sense for our purchasing and preferences to be multi-factor considerations with normally distributed outcomes. This is because when X is scarce, our default position towards X is ‘potentially interested, if the price / conditions are right’. We consider many factors when determining whether conditions are right, so our preferences and decisions are multifactorial in nature – that’s why we see normal distributions so consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a world governed by abundance, it’s all different. When X is abundantly available in many different places and forms, our default position towards any given X is ‘not interested’ unless something specific changes our minds. These aren’t multifactorial decisions – they’re usually dominated by one single factor whose influence trumps everything else. If you care about your smartphone, you’re going to get the nicest one; if you don’t, you’re going to get the cheap one. If you have something specific you want to read, you’re going to read exactly that; otherwise, you’re just going to scroll through Facebook and read whatever. If you care about living in New York, you’re probably ready to make a lot of concessions in order to live there; if you don’t, then there’s no chance. If you’re a Taylor Swift fan, you’re probably willing to pay a lot of money for those tickets; if you aren’t, then there’s a good chance you aren’t willing to pay &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; money for them because even if they were free, you’d rather do something else on Saturday night anyway. The normal distribution is disappearing: we’re in a new world where either you care about something, or you don’t. The middle ground is vanishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do with this idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do, in my view, is to look for areas of the world where our preferences are still normally distributed. Then ask: is this because we’re still operating on scarcity-based principles? And if so, are we headed down the road towards abundance-based principles? If so, what can we expect in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one example: personal banking. Our personal banking requirements are still being served by a big, fat, normally distributed group of companies and services. How come? Is it scarcity-based demand? Well, it certainly isn’t because of actual scarcity. With the birth of online banking and creative partnerships with distribution channels, it’s entirely possible to do your basic banking through any number of online, cheap and functional banking institutions – not to mention the multitude of brick and mortar branches that are all around us, competing for our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have genuinely complex banking and credit requirements. Others don’t. And in a world where banking services are abundant – which I believe we’ve entered, at least in the western world – I’m guessing we’re headed towards a similar iOS/Android style bifurcation. At the high end, we’ll see companies and services like American Express – the iOS of cards in my wallet. But what about the low end? Who’s issuing the basic, cheap, functional personal credit – the low-end Android?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now it’s other banks. But it doesn’t need to be. Banks are expensive to run (especially those with a big physical presence at brick and mortar branches); they’re built for the normally distributed world with its fat middle. But they’re not built for this new, bifurcated world – many of them can’t compete at the low end or the high end; they’re not sophisticated enough to compete with Chase and Amex, but too operationally expensive to compete with an online-only credit union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17.914285714286&quot;&gt;Who could replace them? Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/10/21/will-wal-marts-new-checking-accounts-change-the-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;someone like Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, who already has customer loyalty, the ultimate physical channel, and the resources to make it work? Or maybe, in developing countries whose residents are still unbanked, the wireless carriers? Or maybe emerging payment companies like TenCent, or AliPay, could become effective creditors themselves?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;28.747606614447&quot;&gt;For another example, let’s return to our earlier anecdote about cars. Like I said, automobile production today isn’t a perfect normal distribution – it’s got a bit of a long tail towards the luxury end – but for the most part it’s Gaussian-like. But if we fast forward thirty years, we may see something very different. If the promise of Uber and the driverless car &lt;a href=&quot;http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/27/ways-to-think-about-cars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comes true&lt;/a&gt;, we could be living in a world where the majority of people do not own their vehicles; they simply use them and enjoy access to them. It’s reasonable to speculate that these vehicles, likely owned in fleets, won’t be fancy – they’ll be vanilla Android cars. But there will probably also be another ‘class’ of vehicles – the iOS cars – for those who still care about owning or using a premium vehicle. These might include luxury cars, special work vehicles, or collectors’ items – the important unifying factor being, these vehicles are &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by people who &lt;em&gt;care about ownership&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the vanilla fleet will be used by people who don’t care about fancy ownership – they just need to get places. Either you care about X, or you don’t.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;20.386861313869&quot;&gt;This idea of bifurcated distributions replacing Gaussian distributions maps to the Access Economy idea, which I’ve written about previously, in an interesting way. We may see X Markets of the future that are governed first by a sorting function: Do you really care about X? Do you need your own X, or is access to X enough? Are you a big Taylor Swift fan, and own all her records? (As Taylor wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-1404763219&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her famous WSJ op-ed&lt;/a&gt; last year – part of what makes music special is the contingent of fans who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care, and continue to faithfully buy specific artists’ records even while they stream others’.) Or do you listen to her from time to time on Apple Music, and that’s enough?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you sufficiently well off to pay an old-fashioned, prestigious university degree? Or do you simply need access to online course material and learning opportunity? There’s little doubt that our higher education system will see some sort of shakeup in the next few decades, and to me this looks like a potential bifurcation situation: colleges and universities are getting way too expensive across the board; and yet, students who pay top dollar and go to prestigious schools &lt;em&gt;usually do well!&lt;/em&gt; And furthermore, the amount of online learning opportunities available are exploding – that’s not the problem either. The issue is the big, fat middle that doesn’t serve anybody particularly well – and is sustainable for the most part because we feel like it’s important. We’ll see how long that lasts. (It could be a while, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your company need to lock down a particularly valuable employee to a long-term contract? Or does it simply need access to a steady stream of available talent? For the most part, we don’t get a clear view into how top performing companies structure their compensation from the top all the way down to the bottom – usually we hear about the executive suite and that’s it. But there’s a great exception: professional sports teams, where team salary and cap hit information is usually available. And on these teams, we’ve seen this same thing emerging: either you’re a star, or you’re replacement level. The middle ground is vanishing: either you’re locked up to a multi-year blockbuster deal, or you’re on a one-year, market rate contract that’s pretty indistinguishable from any other. Outside of the sports leagues, where we don’t have such a privileged view, is this happening as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see, too, that these bifurcations are driven by a shift from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance. Buying an album used to be the only way to listen to your own music – now it streams online, quasi-free, always. Learning material used to be precious and valuable – now it’s abundantly available online, everywhere. Employee retention used to be critical for companies from top to bottom – now freelance and temporary labour is abundant, and only the truly scarce need be locked down. These decisions, which were once multifactorial, are becoming single-variable: either you care about X, or you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a dark side to this idea: its sinister cousin, economic inequality. We typically celebrate and value an upwardly mobile society with a “healthy middle class”; in other words, a society whose incomes form a Gaussian distribution. But in a world shifting towards one of abundance, where one would hope that rising tides would lift all boats, could this bifurcation be slowly and irreversibly happening as well? Are we heading towards a two-class system: a class of owners and a class of users? I’ll save this question for part three: I still have a lot of personal research to do before I’m able to properly form an opinion here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, what can we take away from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Normal distributions come from multifactorial situations, where many variables matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In a world governed by scarcity, our decisions and preferences tend to be multifactorial in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In a world governed by abundance, on the other hand, our decisions are no longer multifactorial. They tend to be dominated by one factor above all others: either X matters to you, or it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-If the world is moving in this direction, we might anticipate other industries and ecosystems that could follow. Education, cars, banking, and employment come to mind as examples; there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The fall of the normal distribution maps to the rise of the access economy: ownership and access are not part of the same distribution; they are two halves of a bifurcation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Amateur Porno Set Off a Federal Witch Hunt</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/deep-sleep-how-an-amateur-porn-film-set-off-a-massive-federal-witch-hunt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/deep-sleep-how-an-amateur-porn-film-set-off-a-massive-federal-witch-hunt</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DropCap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o set eyes on Alfred Sole is to like him instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s just welcomed me onto the &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-warner-brothers-fought-to-end-the-chain-gang-system&quot;&gt;Warner Brothers&lt;/a&gt; soundstage in Los Angeles where he works. At 75, Alfred is technically of retirement age, but he remains an in-demand production designer on popular television shows like &lt;em&gt;MacGyver&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/interview-kristen-bell-voiceover-queen-on-frozen-veronica-mars-and-more&quot;&gt;Veronica Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Castle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I approach him, Alfred smiles broadly and extends his hand. He has a boyish face and a soft-spoken, warm manner. He’s of average height with salt-and-pepper hair. He’s like your friendly uncle, or your favorite person to sit next to at the neighborhood bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looks can be deceiving, so I have to ask myself: Is this really the man who in the early 1970s was at the center of a national scandal about a pornographic film titled &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;? A film he was rumored to have shot in his parents’ home in Paterson, New Jersey using a cast and crew made up of family and friends? And it wasn’t just those close to him who participated in the movie—it was alleged that many in his suburban town had taken part, including a local lawyer, banker, police officer and funeral home director. Hell, even the mayor's wife, high-school teachers, and Alfred’s mother were said to have been part of the erotic production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was one of the most notorious national prosecutions of adult film in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the man once described by the government as ‘Public Enemy Number One’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit across from Alfred today, his phone rings. It’s his ex-wife back in Paterson. She wants to know if the person wanting to talk about &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; has arrived. He gently tells her we’re about to start our interview, then proceeds to hold the phone away from his ear to protect himself from the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been 45 years since the film was splashed across the news, but Alfred’s ex has a loud-and-clear message for him: Say nothing. Nothing at all. No good can possibly come from re-visiting the past. Some stories are better left untold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Origins of an Accidental Pornographer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred Sole is a born-and-bred Jersey boy from Paterson, an industrial community of 150,000 residents, 20 miles west of New York City. He vividly remembers the Paterson of his youth in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;SimpleAd SimpleAd--no-padding StoryAdSlot StoryAdSlot--superflex-ad StoryAdSlot--in-feature-story&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suburban city was a mix of working- and middle-class neighborhoods with clearly defined boundaries. There was the Italian enclave, and there was the Irish enclave. The wealthier families—all doctors and lawyers and mostly Jewish—lived by Eastside Park. The working-class Catholics—among which Alfred counted himself—mostly lived by the city’s landmark Great Falls of the Passaic River. Alfred was always curious about the wealth residing in Eastside Park, so much so that one of his main goals in high school was to date a Jewish girl. He went so far as to pretend he was Jewish because the girls he desired weren’t allowed to date outside their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred’s creativity extended beyond his ability to craft a suitable backstory. He had a love of architecture, design and fashion that he honed at the University of Florence in Italy and then used to open a fashion boutique in New York City after graduation. The business was a success, clothing celebrities of the day like &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-whitney-museums-andy-warhol-show-is-more-than-his-greatest-hits&quot;&gt;Andy Warhol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/7-juicy-bits-from-clive-daviss-memoir&quot;&gt;Clive Davis&lt;/a&gt; in custom-made suits. But while Alfred was doing well, he was distracted by a dream—one that had been with him ever since he was a young boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred Sole wanted to make movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks Fancylinks--in-feature-story&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alfred explained it, “I wanted to be a film director more than anything else in the world. For me, everything started from the love of movies. I used to go to the cinema all the time when I was a kid. My parents couldn't afford a babysitter so they would dump me at the theater at 10 in the morning and pick me up just before dinnertime. I devoured film magazines. To this day, if I don't get to a movie on a Saturday I feel uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;SimpleAd SimpleAd--no-padding StoryAdSlot StoryAdSlot--superflex-ad StoryAdSlot--in-feature-story&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day Alfred went out and bought himself a 16-millimeter Bolex camera. He started making short films, leaning on friends and neighbors in Paterson for help. They may not all have been the best actors or crew, but they were available and eager. And Alfred was prolific, working every free moment to realize his dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes dreams cost money. And while Alfred’s clothing boutique was doing well, it wasn’t doing fund-a-feature-film well. So during a regular card game he hosted at his Paterson home, Alfred turned to his friends for advice. He explained how he wanted to make a movie—specifically a Western—but he didn’t know how to fund it. The guys around the table began teasing him, spouting less-than-helpful ideas to raise the desired funds. Then one friend put forward a fateful suggestion: if you make a porno, I’ll give you five grand right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred dismissed the offer, laughing it off as a joke. But soon others around the table piled on. And before he knew it, he’d raised $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You want an X-rated movie? Alright, I'll make one if you’re serious about the money,” Alfred said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all replied yeah. Hell, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;These were all guys in their thirties. Playboy-reading, horny guys from New Jersey. But thanks to them, I now had the budget to make a film.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The guys who threw in the money... one was a judge, one was president of a bank, and there was an accountant. These were all guys in their thirties. &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;-reading, horny guys from New Jersey. But thanks to them, I now had the budget to make a film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many investors in early porn films were motivated by the chance to turn a healthy profit. Gerard Damiano’s &lt;em&gt;Deep Throat&lt;/em&gt; had just come out and the papers were filled with tales of the film’s earnings. With its simple story, accessible humor, and famous party trick, &lt;em&gt;Deep Throat&lt;/em&gt; helped expand the audience for adult films from raincoat-clad middle-aged men to mainstream couples curious about—and titillated by—the hoopla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of profit was a motivating factor for Alfred’s card buddies, but Alfred remembers that they were spurred on by more prurient interests too. “They wanted to come to the casting sessions. They wanted to be on the set. It was that time period, you know? It was the sexual revolution. These were suburban guys with a little bit of cash, hearing about wife swapping and open relationships—and they wanted in. It was in the air in the 1970s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred now had the financial support he needed, but he hadn’t a clue about adult films. He said he’d never seen one—and when Alfred tells you that, you believe him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he headed to Times Square for a cinematic education, and found himself judging the films in a way the average viewer might not. “I thought, God, these people don't wear makeup. They don't have good costumes. The sets look like shit. There's no plot, and no story. A guy takes a bag of groceries out of a woman’s hands and before you know it, they're doing it. Knock on the door, and she spreads her legs.&quot; While he may not have started off wanting to make a porn film, Alfred was sure he could make a better one. Referring to Al Goldstein’s penis-shaped scale for rating adult films, Alfred said, “I want to get five stars on &lt;em&gt;Screw&lt;/em&gt; magazine’s peter meter.&quot; An eloquent example of aiming high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;I want to get five stars on Screw magazine’s peter meter.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Making of ‘Deep Sleep’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to cash in on the success of &lt;em&gt;Deep Throat,&lt;/em&gt; Alfred called his movie &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. Then he set about writing the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The story of &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Harry, who is in love with his niece. One day he finds her having sex with some guy and in a jealous rage, shoots them both. In despair, Harry goes to his niece’s funeral and climbs into her coffin to have sex with her. After that, Harry can’t get it up anymore so he goes to the Maharishi Summa Cumma to learn how to enjoy sex again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred pauses, as if realizing the ridiculousness of it all: “Listen, it wasn’t a great plot but I was just trying to make it fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the story settled, Alfred set about casting his movie. As he watched films during his pornographic crash course, Alfred had seen the same faces popping up over and over—but had no idea where to find these people. So he put an ad in the local trade magazine &lt;em&gt;Backstage&lt;/em&gt;, making clear he was looking for actors willing to have sex on film. Alfred wasn’t sure what he was going to get—or if he’d get any responses at all—but soon replies started pouring in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boy, I saw some strange things. One guy called and asked, ‘Do you need anybody who can blow himself?’ I told him to come on down. I mean, I had to see that. The next day, a reasonably attractive man shows up and proceeds to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. It was only years later I learned that he went by the name &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/vito-aras-stole-harvard-gutenberg-bible-transformed-into-porn-star-dr-infinity&quot;&gt;Dr. Infinity&lt;/a&gt;—for obvious reasons—and that he was a political activist who &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/vito-aras-stole-harvard-gutenberg-bible-transformed-into-porn-star-dr-infinity&quot;&gt;once tried to steal a copy of the Gutenberg Bible&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard University. You can’t make this stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then I got a call from a woman who called herself Honeysuckle Divine and said she did something to Tchaikovsky’s '1812 Overture.' She showed up with a tape recorder, a large container of talcum powder and a broom. She quickly disrobed, laid on her back, put a bunch of powder in her vagina and hit play on the tape recorder. Well, when the guns went off in the song, she emitted little puffs of smoke from down below. It made me proud to be an American.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks Fancylinks--in-feature-story&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Alfred met Kim Pope. Like Alfred, Kim had grown up in New Jersey. She began acting as a child, playing Snow White, Becky Thatcher, and walking down the yellow brick road more times than she cared to remember. After moving to New York as a young adult, Kim answered an ad for an adult film. She had no qualms about having sex in front of the camera. Kim wasn’t shy about her body and thought porn would be a great way to learn about filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a petite and attractive blonde, Alfred remembers Kim as a talented actor and extremely kind. He knew right away that he wanted her to play Harry’s niece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim had a similar response to Alfred. When asked about meeting him for the first time, Kim said, “My first impression was that he was a very nice guy, very sincere. I think &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was his first film and he really wanted to do a good job, within the limitations of a minuscule budget and a short shooting schedule. It was all really sweet, and I liked him very much so I was on board.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Boy, I saw some strange things. One guy called and asked, ‘Do you need anybody who can blow himself?’ I told him to come on down.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the male leads, Alfred leaned on local actors. The part of Harry was played by Joseph Rose, a Shakespearean hopeful on the fence about participating in an adult movie. A local muscleman named Anthony DeMarco, who played Kim’s boyfriend, had no such qualms about appearing in a porn film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was no doubt that &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; would be marketed as an adult film, Alfred didn’t give much thought to the fact that he was making a pornographic movie. For him, &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was simply a chance to be involved in making a real film: “I never saw it as a porno. I mean it was X-rated and, yes, people had to fuck and do all this other stuff, but I just never saw it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead actress Kim Pope had similar feelings about adult films. And while she never had a problem making them, she did worry her participation might damage her acting career down the road. But she justified her involvement by telling herself these films weren’t going anywhere. They’d play in scuzzy theaters in sleazy neighborhoods like Times Square, nobody would see them, and then they would disappear. It never occurred to her that one would stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to dismiss Alfred and Kim’s justifications in today’s age of streaming video and reissued films, but in the early 1970s the future landscape was far from clear. Many aspirational filmmakers—including Barry Sonnenfeld, Wes Craven and Francis Ford Coppola—worked on sex films as a way of learning about the business. And you could often find crew members who worked with established directors like Woody Allen picking up extra money on the sets of porn films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those were already reasonably seasoned film participants. Alfred Sole had no idea how to make a porn film. To be honest, he didn’t know much about making &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of film. Kim Pope picked up on this straight away. “As we got into things, it became very evident that none of these people had ever made a film before. Alfred had roped in his buddies and neighbors, and they were having a great time. But they were not pornographers—these were suburban, very straight people. It felt like middle America. Go to the next PTA meeting and look around the room—that's who these people were.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;These were suburban, very straight people. It felt like middle America. Go to the next PTA meeting and look around the room—that's who these people were.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was truly a homegrown affair. Just like when he'd made films as a kid, Alfred asked his friends and neighbors to help out behind the scenes and on screen as extras. And as he started shooting in Paterson, New Jersey in the summer of 1972, Alfred was in heaven. “The idea of making a movie—just the idea—with lights and cameras and actors was my dream. When I opened the door to my house for the crew to enter, it was the most exciting day of my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with those offering their support was Alfred’s then-wife—the same woman now warning Alfred not to speak about &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. She worked with Alfred’s mother to organize the production, prepare meals for the crew and generally help out any way she could. The one area she and Alfred avoided discussing was the hardcore sex. When asked why, Alfred answered “The sex stuff wasn't the fun of it. The fun was making the movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred understood that some of his cast and crew wouldn't be comfortable around a hardcore film shoot. So he shot all the non-sex scenes first, then went back to film the required sex. This division made it easier for many of Alfred’s friends and family to turn a blind eye to the fact that &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was, in fact, an adult film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few professionals whom Alfred hired weren’t adult film veterans either, and they approached the shoot with a mix of curiosity, trepidation and excitement. Joseph Friedman was hired as the cinematographer—and it was his first time on a porn set. He had reservations about working on an adult movie but was desperate for film experience. Actually he had one even bigger concern. “I guess the greatest fear in your mind is that you're going to walk around with this constant erection and have to sit down a lot to hide what's going on” Joseph admits. “But the reality is that it is the most unsexual thing you could possibly imagine to witness. It's like bolts going into nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;The sex stuff wasn't the fun of it. The fun was making the movie.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred’s lack of experience filming sex may have contributed to the shoot’s unerotic atmosphere. He struggled with how to direct the performers, explaining “I didn’t know how to talk to these people. The first day I thought, what do I say? Put your penis in her vagina? But by day three I was like OK, come on. We have a deadline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may have gotten used to it, but questions like “Did we get the cum shot?” and terms like “chopped meat” never became second nature to Alfred. He found filming the sex scenes completely strange and numbing. And this experience didn’t end on set either—during the production Alfred found himself utterly devoid of any sexual desire in his private life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actress Kim Pope also found the sex on adult films far from arousing. She was playing a role and focused on providing a realistic experience for the audience, not to mention trying not to kick the cameraman in what were often close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shooting schedule for &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was hectic. It was made all the more difficult by some of the locations Alfred wrote into the script, including a funeral home. Alfred had helped a friend design the business a while back and was looking for a favor in return. To save on set design costs, the funeral director allowed Alfred to shoot between services, taking advantage of the flowers and other trappings mourners had arranged for their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remember it was like the Keystone Kops” Alfred said. “There were two funerals going on that day. I stole the flowers from one funeral. We took the body out of the coffin. We had to move fast because we had to be out in a couple hours. It wasn't treated disrespectfully, but... we had to get these two people fucking in a coffin real quick, you know what I mean? It was crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strange circumstances weren’t lost on the crew. Cameraman Joseph Friedman remembers, “I walked into the funeral parlor and exclaimed ‘Alfred, you did a great of job setting this up.’ He said, ‘Oh, no, no, no. This is a real funeral that's going to take place at five this afternoon and we need to be done before they come in.’ I asked done with what and Alfred answered ‘the scene where Kim is in the casket and Harry gets in and fucks her.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;It wasn't treated disrespectfully, but... we had to get these two people fucking in a coffin real quick, you know what I mean? It was crazy.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Alfred carefully separated the filming of sex scenes from the rest of the film: “I filmed my whole family crying in front of the coffin. My mother was in the scene. My aunt was in it. We even had the mayor's wife in it. Then we made them leave, and brought in Kim and Joe Rose to have sex in the coffin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But few other scenes were as sad—and many were downright funny. Alfred breaks into peals of laughter as he describes a scene with a character named Dr. Dicktor. As part of a thorough medical examination of an attractive young woman, the good doctor places a tongue depressor between her legs and asks her to cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less humorous were performance issues afflicting some of the male actors on set. Local performer Anthony DeMarco was particularly affected. Kim Pope remembers trying to bolster the actor’s confidence as she and Alfred waited for what seemed like hours while Anthony tried to arouse himself. “Alfred had warned me that he’d never been in an adult film before and that he was very nervous. It's very hard for the men. So I said, ‘Don't worry. I'll calm him down. I'll walk him through it.’ But he was scared to death.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the seasoned adult stars had performance issues too. “I didn't know porno stars could come to work and not get an erection. But it was a daily problem, and after a while my politeness went away,” Alfred said. “If someone couldn't get an erection, I was like a madman. I remember having a temper tantrum, screaming, ‘Hey, you've got to get it up here. This is costing me a lot of money. You guys are paid to get a hard-on. You came to me bragging that you have the biggest dicks in the world, and now you can't get them up?!’ At one point I actually used a friend who was visiting the set to stand in for one of the porn guys. So if you watch the scene, you'll see the pubic hair goes black, blonde, black, blonde. To this day, the guy’s wife doesn't know that it was actually him that was screwing on film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;To this day, the guy’s wife doesn't know that it was actually him that was screwing on film.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last day of shooting Alfred and the crew descended on a stately home, a location he’d wanted to use all along. He didn’t have a permit, but decided to take his chances. “We just grabbed the shot. Most of our stuff was grabbed. It was low-budget filmmaking, guerrilla filmmaking. I only found out later that the house belonged to an archbishop in the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we wrapped that day I remember being satisfied with how it had all turned out. The filming had gone very well. We were pretty much on schedule and had got most of our desired shots. So I sent everyone home and prepared for post-production, which is where the hard work really comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Premiere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like filming, editing went smoothly for Alfred. When he was done cutting the film, Alfred decided he wanted to commission some original music. So he turned where anyone would turn in those circumstances—to his wife’s 16-year-old cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butch Taylor spent most of his teenage years down in the basement with friends playing guitar, bass and drums and making recordings. They had a band—and now an opportunity for a professional gig. It would be unpaid, but it would be their first big shot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem was, Butch and his friends legally weren’t old enough to watch a porn film. Alfred made an exception and screened his film for the band. Kim Pope joined them because she wanted to see the edited work as well. As they sat viewing the movie, Butch had the urge to compliment her on her acting, but was unable. It was the first time he’d seen anyone have sex, and he was struck speechless. Butch and his friends wound up re-watching the film over and over in the basement as they wrote and played the accompanying music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With editing and sound mixing complete, Alfred was ready to look into distribution. It was time to find out whether &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was good enough to show in Times Square. Two theater owners dominated the grindhouses of 1970s New York. One was Chelly Wilson, a Greek immigrant who found success in Times Square real estate. Alfred remembers taking the film to screen for Chelly. “She was a really interesting lady. She started by telling me how she came from Greece and first had a pushcart that she sold hotdogs from, then used her earnings to get on the real estate ladder. She was a really successful woman by this point, so I was really nervous. As I screened the movie for her, she sat chain-smoking and talking to another woman in Greek. She occasionally cackled with laughter which I took as a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;I wanted my name on it...I made a movie, and I didn’t care if it was X-rated or not. It’s like an artist who signs his name at the bottom of a painting.&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then at a certain point she said, ‘No more’—and that signaled the end of the screening. She told me the movie was great, but then gave me a list of all the things I’d need to change in order for her to exhibit it. These were the rules of making porno in the 1970s, and to get distribution you had to meet them: You had to have a certain number of cum shots and make sure you showed the man pulling out to finish. You had to have at least one lesbian scene. It was basically all the stuff I had cut out because I found it too crude. So I went back and added the hardcore shots back in, and then we secured distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When finalizing the film credits, Alfred respected the wishes of friends and family who chose to remain anonymous. But as for himself, Alfred didn’t want to hide. “I wanted my name on it. Maybe it was in part an ego trip, but I believed in the film and didn’t think I’d done anything wrong. I made a movie, and I didn’t care if it was X-rated or not. It’s like an artist who signs his name at the bottom of a painting. I signed my name on the bottom of this painting in my life. It was a labor of absolute love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was finally released, Alfred was the proudest person in Paterson. He remembers standing in front of a local cinema marquee showing his film and feeling like a kid in a candy store. As he stared beaming with pride, more and more people showed up to see the movie. Soon enough there were long lines. It seemed to Alfred like all of Paterson was there to see his film and the theater owner pretty much confirmed it. He told Alfred &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; was out-grossing &lt;em&gt;The Poseidon Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, selling out every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote PullQuote--in-feature-story&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__feature&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;He could hear people whisper things like, 'That couch they’re fucking on!? I can’t believe I’ve sat on it so many times.'&lt;span class=&quot;PullQuote__small-quote&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not everyone was able to see the film. When soundtrack composer Butch Taylor and his high-school friends tried to get into the theater, they were stopped cold at the box office. Butch showed the cashier his school ID to prove that his was the name on the film poster behind her, but the response was still a hard no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, other people who had helped out on the film were able to see it—and to many it was a bit of a shock. While from the beginning Alfred had told them that there would be hardcore sex in the movie, seeing it was believing. Alfred recalled being at the theater and literally seeing mouths drop open. He could hear people whisper things like, “That couch they’re fucking on!? I can’t believe I’ve sat on it so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buzz continued outside of the theaters. Alfred recalls going to a friend’s wedding and hearing a couple of guys talk about him while he was relieving himself in the men’s room. They seemed to be fighting over who knew Alfred best. And Alfred was enjoying it. “I remember I felt a little bit like a celebrity. I was proud. And it was fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did Alfred know that events were about to take a sharp turn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone’s a Critic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; continued to perform well at the box office, the film started attracting attention for the wrong reasons. And one man in particular took an interest—his name was John T. Niccollai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niccollai had recently been appointed first assistant prosecutor for Passaic County. When he started the job, he got into the habit of personally going through all the mail that came in from residents. He considered it to be like taking the community’s pulse. Even though the county is so close to New York City, he found Paterson a much more conservative environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1972, concerned citizens began contacting the prosecutor’s office about a local film that was being shown, and Niccollai said the volume of complaints quickly grew into an avalanche. Some protests came from residents that only heard about the film once it hit the theaters, others from people who had actually been part of the film but had no idea it was going to be so explicit. But perhaps the straw that broke the prosecutor’s back was when members of the clergy began contacting his office, outraged that the archbishop’s house had been included in such a cinematic abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Niccollai, it all led to one conclusion: “If you make it easy for people to do things that are offensive, you're going to attract similar people to the jurisdiction. It’s going to cause other people to come in and make this type of movie here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alfred caught wind of the fact that the prosecutor’s office was looking into his film—all thanks to complaints from the Catholic Church—he was furious: “Niccollai wasn't spurred on by community complaints. My film was shown in theaters where many other X-rated movies had played before. He was solely motivated by the church because I had supposedly insulted the bishop. And if you think about the history of the church and what it's done to mankind, it's really incredible. The church has done a lot more damage in the name of God than I did with my tiny little film in Paterson, where people paid money to see and enjoyed it.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Members of the church decided to protest the film. They formed a human chain in front of the most popular theater in Paterson to prevent people from seeing &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. Those who made it through were greeted by protesters shaming them as they came out—all caught by local news cameras covering the demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon there were warrants out for the arrests of those responsible for the film, and well as for those that appeared in it. Kim Pope remembers the first time she heard about the trouble when she called home to let a friend know she was on her way: “My friend said, ‘Don’t come home. The FBI is on our doorstep and they’re looking for you.’ I asked him if he was sure it was me they wanted as I couldn’t think of any reason they’d have for talking to me. I even laughed, telling him obviously they’ve got the wrong person. But he said ‘Kim, this is serious. There have been two agents on our doorstep for three days round the clock, just waiting for you.’ So I went to stay with some friends and figure out what the hell was going on. It took about a week to learn that the reason for their interest was the film I’d shot in New Jersey. I was facing up to 28 years in prison for a selection of some truly bizarre charges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And bizarre the charges certainly were, because it was actually pretty difficult to prosecute someone with making a pornographic film in 1972. This was a year before the Supreme Court case ‘Miller v. California’ established what came to be known as the ‘Miller Test’ to determine if a work was obscene. The only recent precedent Niccollai had to go on was a 1964 Supreme Court decision where the lead justice famously said about obscenity, “I know it when I see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if Niccollai was to be successful, he needed to get creative: “I knew that if you spend some time in a law library, you're always going to be able to find something that is compatible with the course of action you want to take. So I went into the library, did a lot of research, and came up with something that would help us get the film out of our county.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find his legal weaponry, Niccollai went back in time—to 1796 to be exact. He found an anti-fornication law from the 18th century that was technically still active in New Jersey. It was an ancient statute prohibiting people from having—and in some cases even thinking about—sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Pope couldn’t believe what she was hearing when she finally learned what she was being prosecuted with. “I was charged with fornication, conspiracy to fornicate, acts of carnal indecency, conspiracy to commit acts of carnal indecency and, I swear to God, private lewdness. These were old, old laws that had been around for hundreds of years, and nobody had ever bothered to take them off the books. I mean, if you enforce those laws, then every person over the age of 12 would be in jail. I don't know anybody that hasn't conspired to fornicate, whether they succeeded or not. It was just so absurd I thought they had to be kidding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Niccollai saw the absurdity in the laws too. He understood that prosecuting everyone who engaged in intercourse outside of marriage was a ridiculous thought: “I'm not going to sit here and tell you that in my tenure as first assistant prosecutor, we initiated thousands of prosecutions for adultery or fornication. We didn't. But the fact is the laws were on the books and we knew we could use them. Is that a problem with our system? Maybe. This was my introduction to the power of the prosecutor.” And Niccollai aimed that power at &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step for the prosecution was to get information that tied &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; to the filmmakers. So Niccollai obtained a search warrant for Alfred’s house and, accompanied by a slew of assistants, made his way over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they raided my house, that was scary” Alfred remembers. “It was like a B-movie. They knocked down my door, and they went through everything. They tore up the sofa. They trashed my house. They came at me like I was this super-criminal. They were grabbing everything and anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niccollai walked away from Alfred’s house with some photo stills of the film being made and several artifacts, including a whip he was convinced was used in the movie. Niccollai took this evidence to a grand jury and was able to get the indictments he sought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred quickly reached out and warned those that had helped him on the film. First he called cinematographer Joseph Friedman and suggested that if he had an address book with information about anyone connected to the film, he should get rid of it. Then Alfred called Butch Taylor and other family members to let them know that the movie was being investigated. Finally Alfred called friends who had helped him out on the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time he made a call, Alfred was met with fear and sometimes anger: “It became a witch hunt and got really scary. They were after everybody. It became this small town where people were afraid—afraid for their careers and their livelihood. And I felt incredibly guilty. You know how people will do anything to make a movie? Well, I did anything to make a movie, and along the way I betrayed their friendship. I didn't do it intentionally. I just had no idea how crazy things would get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred questioned Niccollai’s motivations. He was convinced Niccollai was going after &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; to make a name for himself. Because prosecutors are elected officials, Alfred was sure Niccollai was just thinking about his future, not about protecting the community. Niccollai flatly denied this, stating that he was just doing his job and meeting his obligation to serve the people he represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first Alfred entertained the idea of a plea bargain. He had the fate of friends and family to consider: “Do you know how many phone calls I got, people saying to me ‘Look what you've done, you've ruined my life.’ Friends were afraid for their professions and their families. Some of the investors... their wives didn't even know that they had backed the film. There were six school teachers involved, including my wife, who could lose their licenses. My funeral director friend could lose his license and his livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had an Italian mother-in-law who came to hate me, and wanted to have me killed by the Mafia. I had ruined her daughter, I had ruined the family name. I mean, you'd think I’d killed the pope...But like everyone else who had worked on the film, [most of my wife's family] had been really excited while we were making &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;... Now [they were] afraid ... but I understood [their] fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alfred believed in the freedom of expression. As long as nobody is harmed, he felt this freedom was critical to being an artist: “You can't tell an artist what to say or do. Even if an artist comes into a room and shits on the floor, he’s free to do that, and that's what's good about this country. We think we have that freedom. We don't, but we think we have that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Pope was also convinced they shouldn’t back down. She was absolutely indignant about the charges brought against her, and perhaps young enough at the time to not fear potential repercussions: “I wanted to take the case to trial. There was absolutely no way I was settling. I was not going to be intimidated. Certain conservative elements were absolutely hysterical over the sexual revolution, and everything that meant, and they were desperately trying to put the lid back on Pandora's box. Who made them the moral center of America? They had no right. If you want to go and see an X-rated film, then that should be your choice. I personally don't like violence in films, but I will defend your right to make one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Alfred and Kim decided to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See You in Court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the trial, a large group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse to defend the pornographers. They were organized by Alfred Sole’s mother, who hadn’t seen &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; but was convinced that Alfred hadn’t done anything wrong. She developed the “Free Alfred Sole” campaign, bumper stickers and all. She even brought picket signs and handed them out to those that gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred was determined to come to court with his head held high, and arranged a big media entrance for Kim Pope. He had a limousine bring her to the trial and Kim wore the shortest mini-dress she could find. “We wanted to embarrass them” Kim explained. “If they had the nerve to pull out these totally ridiculous charges, we were going to let people know about it. We were not going to slink in the back door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niccollai was somewhat taken aback by all the commotion: “I had never seen anything like it in my life. It was like a Hollywood premiere. There were all kinds of media members covering it, and police, and just loads of people. You couldn't find a place to park, you couldn't stand in front of the courthouse. And if you saw the way the star of the movie came dressed, it was obvious she wasn’t going to the confessional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial became a cause célèbre, making all the news programs as well as the late-night TV show circuit. But inside the courtroom, the atmosphere was different. Kim Pope saw it as a kangaroo court where the outcome was decided before the trial had even started: “Oh my God, there was no justice. I was so disillusioned, and I started to be nervous, because I realized that truth and justice and common sense had nothing to do with the outcome. It was very corrupt—and very frightening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As court appearances became more and more frequent, there was no end in sight. The case could drag on for years, and Alfred and Kim’s attorneys believed they knew why. They thought that the prosecutor’s plan was to wear the defendants down, and let their costs continue to rack up. The fees could easily grow into hundreds of thousands of dollars, and Alfred and Kim just didn’t have that kind of money. Their lawyers worked on a deal which would have them plead guilty to disorderly conduct. All they would have to do was to admit their guilt in court and pay a fifty dollar fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred and Kim were on the verge of taking the deal, when things suddenly got a whole lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started when Alfred received a phone call from United Press: “The journalist asked me if I knew that I’d just been indicted for interstate transportation of pornography. I put down the phone and thought, ‘What the fuck is going on?’” Alfred was in disbelief because he’d been very careful to only show &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; in New York and New Jersey theaters. Even a newbie like him knew that distributing pornography across state lines was a federal offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somehow, a stolen print of &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; had turned up in an Oklahoma City theater, hundreds of miles away. Alfred thought he was being framed: “I remember that when the movie first opened, a theater owner in New Jersey called us to say his print was stolen—and he needed a replacement. I thought it was a little bizarre that someone would steal the film, but didn’t give it much thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I put two and two together when I got a second call telling me that FBI agents had been in an Oklahoma City theater and had busted the film there. We never booked a print in Oklahoma. This was the stolen print. I was being set up by Niccollai,&quot; Alfred said. His lawyers even suggested that Niccollai had made several trips to Oklahoma. &quot;We were totally set up. And now the stakes were really high.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Niccollai recalls some communication between his office and Oklahoma City, but claims he can’t recall the exact nature of the exchange. He states that if he was asked for help by another jurisdiction, he absolutely would have provided it. But he flatly denies ever setting foot in Oklahoma or trying to frame Alfred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did come out of Oklahoma was a minute-by-minute report of what the FBI agents saw in the theater the day the film was busted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Mobiledoc&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To: Acting Director, FBI &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re: Deep Sleep, pornographic motion picture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 2pm on January 21st, 1973 Special Agents [redacted] and [redacted] began viewing a movie entitled &lt;em href=&quot;null&quot;&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; showing at the Centre Theater in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:23pm, there was a scene in a doctor’s office which showed a nude female on the examining table with her legs spread apart. The doctor inserted his finger into the woman’s vagina and began massaging her for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:40 PM, a scene was observed wherein what appeared to be a candle shaped to the form of a penis was used to stimulate a nude female in the vagina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:41pm, a scene was observed wherein a nude female was performing fellatio on a nude male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:46pm, the male ejaculated on a piece of glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 2:49pm began a long scene in which a nude female begins to massage a nude male who is lying in a hammock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:55pm, the male climaxes on her face and chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 3:12pm, a scene showed a female performing fellatio on a nude male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie concluded at approximately 3:15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher stakes meant that the news headlines about &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; graduated from the local to the national level, and now Alfred Sole was terrified. He understood that a federal charge meant that the potential punishment was significantly more severe. And the controversy also kept the spotlight on his family and friends—who desperately wanted to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a stressful time. A cross was burned on Alfred’s front lawn so the cops assigned a round-the-clock watch on his house. And then there was the fate of local actor Anthony DeMarco who had played Kim Pope’s boyfriend. When the federal charges came to light, DeMarco committed suicide. Details of his motives were sketchy, but Alfred felt the two were connected: “I was walking on eggshells. I never knew when the phone was going to ring with more bad news. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, it kept getting worse. And worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the federal trial date was set and Alfred and his friend—one of the film's producers—traveled to Oklahoma. “As we made our way to the airport [he] said to me, ‘I’m married, I have two kids, my whole life could be ruined in just a few days. What are we going to do?’ I didn't have an answer for him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a hostile environment in Oklahoma. The local paper reported the story about a Dago and a Jew, two pornographers, coming to town. That’s what they called us in the paper—a Dago and a Jew. I read that and thought, Holy shit. We’re in serious trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several days in court, the trial was abruptly ended after some back-room plea-bargaining. The judge suddenly dismissed the case, giving Alfred a one-year suspended sentence, a $2,500 fine for each count, and a two-year probation period during which Alfred was banned from making any films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Alfred hated the idea of not fighting for his artistic rights, he explained his decision with resignation. “I got scared. I thought the whole world was falling in on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we were leaving the courtroom, a clerk had a print of &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; in his hand and said, ‘Hey! Your film is great. We’re going to play it at our Christmas party!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought, “Fuck you.” I was not amused. I mean, Jesus Christ, this is our system? This is the great American justice system?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred had one final surprise when he returned home from Oklahoma. He got a phone call from the local paper letting him know there had been a formal ceremony at his neighborhood Catholic church excommunicating him. Alfred’s only thought? He couldn’t believe he had that much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy of a Sex Film&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the money &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; made—and there was quite a bit thanks to the film’s success—Alfred never saw any of it. In accordance with court rulings, the government confiscated all proceeds along with any prints of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all the distress associated with &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, Alfred credits the film with his subsequent success in life. It allowed him to make his next movie, the cult anti-Catholic horror film &lt;em&gt;Alice Sweet Alice&lt;/em&gt;, featuring a young Brooke Shields. And that lead to other films and eventually a career in Hollywood where he still works today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alfred explains, “It gave me my dream. I made a film that led to other films. And what &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; taught me was to continue making movies the way I wanted, no matter what anyone else said. It gave me the drive and confidence that I needed. Ever since then when I get home from work every day I look in the mirror and ask myself if I was as creative as I could be that day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for John Niccolai, he also views his experience with &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; as a success. “I think we did what needed to be done, and we did it as effectively and efficiently as we could under the circumstances. We managed to get a result when no one else was getting results. We found an avenue to restrict something that was not in the best interest of the community. We weren't looking to put people in jail for 20 years—we wanted to stop the activities. Maybe the explosion exceeded the guidelines, but we didn't have parameters—it just blew up and went everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actress Kim Pope also felt that Niccolai’s efforts were successful: “They accomplished their mission, because they frightened off legitimate actors, legitimate film people. That's why today, 45 years later, we have a separate adult film industry. We had wanted to blur the lines. We thought that the idea of adult entertainment would disappear, the idea of X-rated films as a separate genre. We thought that once the public got used to adult films, they would get over the hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you're making films or doing any sort of artistic thing, prohibiting something is like saying, ‘You can compose a symphony, but you can't use this octave, you can't play those notes.’ I wanted to see people playing on a full keyboard. And history is funny, because looking back it felt like a very innocent time. I didn't perceive it as being sleazy, or criminal, or even rebellious, really. It was just a very free time when we were pushing the envelope of artistic expression, and fighting back against puritanical, ridiculous hang-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt; did have its consequences. I realized it was going to make my legitimate acting career virtually impossible. There had just been too much publicity and too much prejudice, and I was too well known at that point. Which is kind of sad. But you can't turn back the clock. And I have no regrets because I think it was important that we fought. I'm glad that they picked on us, because we didn't cave in. You can't have regrets about anything you’ve done—only about the things you didn't do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the end of our interview, I ask Alfred when was the last time he saw &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. He answers that it has been decades, probably around the time that the film was pulled from theaters in the early 1970s. So I ask him to watch it again with me and he does, right then and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the film is over, I ask one last question: What does he think of this landmark film, a movie that had started his career, and that he’d risked so much for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred draws a breath and answers “Wow, it really sucks. It’s a piece of shit! Did I really make that? You kind of separate yourself—your memories of something and the reality of something are two different things. My memories were so fond but now seeing it I’m thinking maybe the prosecutor was right... I mean it shouldn’t have been prosecuted for indecency—we need to have freedom of expression—but it’s definitely criminal in the artistic sense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Niccolai was onto something after all...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text parbase section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main_content&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People suffering from a debilitating and often discounted disease known as chronic fatigue syndrome may soon have something they’ve been seeking for decades: scientific proof of their ailment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have created a blood test that can flag the disease, which currently lacks a standard, reliable diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Too often, this disease is categorized as imaginary,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ronald-davis&quot;&gt;Ron Davis&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor of biochemistry and of genetics. When individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome seek help from a doctor, they may undergo a series of tests that check liver, kidney and heart function, as well as blood and immune cell counts, Davis said. “All these different tests would normally guide the doctor toward one illness or another, but for chronic fatigue syndrome patients, the results all come back normal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, he said, is that they’re not looking deep enough. Now, Davis; &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.uci.edu/users/rahim-esfandyarpour&quot;&gt;Rahim Esfandyarpour&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a former Stanford research associate; and their colleagues have devised a blood-based test that successfully identified participants in a study with chronic fatigue syndrome. The test, which is still in a pilot phase, is based on how a person’s immune cells respond to stress. With blood samples from 40 people — 20 with chronic fatigue syndrome and 20 without — the test yielded precise results, accurately flagging all chronic fatigue syndrome patients and none of the healthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnostic platform could even help identify possible drugs to treat chronic fatigue syndrome. By exposing the participants’ blood samples to drug candidates and rerunning the diagnostic test, the scientists could potentially see whether the drug improved the immune cells’ response. Already, the team is using the platform to screen for potential drugs they hope can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper describing the research findings was published online April 29 in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Davis is the senior author. Esfandyarpour, who is now on the faculty of the University of California-Irvine, is the lead author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Providing the proof&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, when it actually is diagnosed, is based on symptoms — exhaustion, sensitivity to light and unexplained pain, among other things — and it comes only after other disease possibilities have been eliminated. It is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis and designated by the acronym ME/CFS. It’s estimated that 2 million people in the United States have chronic fatigue syndrome, but that’s a rough guess, Davis said, and it’s likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Davis, the quest to find scientific evidence of the malady is personal. It comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2016spring/the-puzzle-solver.html&quot;&gt;a desire to help his son&lt;/a&gt;, who has suffered from ME/CFS for about a decade. In fact, it was a biological clue that Davis first spotted in his son that led him and Esfandyarpour to develop the new diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;xlarge&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly see a difference in the way healthy and chronic fatigue syndrome immune cells process stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach, of which Esfandyarpour led the development, employs a “nanoelectronic assay,” which is a test that measures changes in miniscule amounts of energy as a proxy for the health of immune cells and blood plasma. The diagnostic technology contains thousands of electrodes that create an electrical current, as well as chambers to hold simplified blood samples composed of immune cells and plasma. Inside the chambers, the immune cells and plasma interfere with the current, changing its flow from one end to another. The change in electrical activity is directly correlated with the health of the sample. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to stress the samples from both healthy and ill patients using salt, and then compare how each sample affects the flow of the electrical current. Changes in the current indicate changes in the cell: the bigger the change in current, the bigger the change on a cellular level. A big change is not a good thing; it’s a sign that the cells and plasma are flailing under stress and incapable of processing it properly. All of the blood samples from ME/CFS patients created a clear spike in the test, whereas those from healthy controls returned data that was on a relatively even keel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know exactly why the cells and plasma are acting this way, or even what they’re doing,” Davis said. “But there is scientific evidence that this disease is not a fabrication of a patient’s mind. We clearly see a difference in the way healthy and chronic fatigue syndrome immune cells process stress.” Now, Esfandyarpour and Davis are expanding their work to confirm the findings in a larger cohort of participants. Recruitment for the larger project, which aims to further confirm the success of the diagnostic test, is being done on a rolling basis. Those who are interested in participating should contact clinical research coordinator &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:aokumu@stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Anna Okumu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doubling up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnosing ME/CFS, the researchers are also harnessing the platform to screen for drug-based treatments, since currently the options are slim. “Using the nanoelectronics assay, we can add controlled doses of many different potentially therapeutic drugs to the patient’s blood samples and run the diagnostic test again,” Esfandyarpour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the blood samples taken from those with ME/CFS still respond poorly to stress and generate a spike in electrical current, then the drug likely didn’t work. If, however, a drug seems to mitigate the jump in electrical activity, that could mean it is helping the immune cells and plasma better process stress. So far, the team has already found a candidate drug that seems to restore healthy function to immune cells and plasma when tested in the assay. The drug, while successful in the assay, is not currently being used in people with ME/CFS, but Davis and Esfandyarpour are hopeful that they can test their finding in a clinical trial in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the drugs being tested are either already approved by the Food and Drug Administration or will soon be broadly accessible to the public, which is key to fast access and dissemination should any of these compounds pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis is a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://biox.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford Bio-X&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html&quot;&gt;Stanford Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/chri.html&quot;&gt;Stanford Maternal &amp;amp; Child Health Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Stanford authors of the study are research scientists Mohsen Nemat-Gorgani and Julie Wilhelmy and research assistant, Alex Kashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Open Medicine Foundation. Davis is the director of the foundation’s scientific advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford’s departments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://genetics.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=&quot;http://biochemistry.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/a&gt; also supported the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Strategies, Tips, and Tricks for Anki</title>
<link>https://senrigan.io/blog/everything-i-know-strategies-tips-and-tricks-for-spaced-repetition-anki</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://senrigan.io/blog/everything-i-know-strategies-tips-and-tricks-for-spaced-repetition-anki</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, Anki has acted as my digital storage (albeit, imperfect). If I look something up in StackOverflow, I'll add it to Anki. Wikipedia? Another Anki card. It's probably the one thing I most attribute to helping my software engineering career. My total deck recently passed ten thousand cards. In this guide, I'll explain the avoidable (dumb) mistakes, but also provide the effective strategies I found along the way. This Anki guide assumes the reader is familiar with these topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to add cards to Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki decks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an introduction to Spaced Repetition and Anki, please read this earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;article. How Anki Saved My Programming Career&lt;/a&gt;. While I focus on Anki a bit, principles from this guide also apply to SuperMemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Updated: &lt;strong&gt;5/04/2019&lt;/strong&gt;. I will continuously update this from feedback and suggestions. If any bullet points need elaboration, please let me know. A lot was shortened for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beginner's Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Anki beginners, habit &amp;amp; friction is your enemy. Maintaining a daily routine is critical. Read the Beginner's Section below and visit after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;you've maintained Anki for 21 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have more than a hundred cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying beginners to stop reading this guide ... just the rest can be a little overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Anki beginners quit. You'll only keep a Anki routine if you quickly see benefits. Focus on adding work or study related cards for an immediate benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a computer to add cards to Anki. It is hard to add cards on mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning, try not to add more than twenty cards a day. It's very easy to desire to &quot;remember everything&quot; and find yourself overwhelmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add simple cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewing Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download (and review using) the mobile apps. This is probably the most important tip.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Android (free) version is amazing! There is also a iOS version ($25).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a daily habit to review all your cards. In the beginning, reviewing take two to four minutes. It's easy to skip and then catch up, but having a routine will be critical later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to make reviewing Anki as easy as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Card Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki comes with three default card types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Categories and Recommended Card Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;269&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommend Card Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;General&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic + Reversed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avoid tip-of-the-tongue issues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Screenshots from Video Tutorials (YouTube, etc)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It's hard to format screenshots to fit front-and-back or cloze formats.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Code Block (Snippet)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic, Use Anki Code Plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most code snippets are hard to format.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Code Block (StackOverflow Answer)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic, Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most code snippets are hard to format to fit basic-and-reversed. I frequently will just take a snapshot of the answer and paste unformatted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definitions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic-and-reversed can have multiple answers. Easier to make a basic card. Definitions in cloze can let the answer slip too easily.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wikipedia Paragraph&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wikipedia articles are a great way to provide context while quizzing you on key topics. Improves fundamentals.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Labelled Images (Human Body, Anatomy, Maps, etc)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Image Occlusion Plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Your brain was designed for visual memory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;List&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cloze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lists are difficult to memorize on basic. Cloze cards separates a list into multiple cards.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding Basic type cards. If you can make a basic card, you can probably make it a Basic + Reversed (BR) Card. BR Cards help avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;tip of the tongue phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/2chYgJqOSXaEbkjegN0U&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;729&quot; height=&quot;182&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For definitions (example: provenance), the basic+reversed type isn't helpful. I want to know a word's meaning, but trying to recall something that means &quot;origin&quot; has too many answers (immemorial, provenance, inception, etc). &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/6PYo8PKRdqFHXDuhLumQ&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;242&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloze cards are great for adding context to understand a topic. Most basic+reversed cards can be made into cloze cards. Over time my preferences have gone from Basic —&amp;gt; Basic + Reversed —&amp;gt; Cloze.&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/4MMKadx8T9eYixCmrWQV&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1237&quot; height=&quot;139&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adding Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each question should have a single succinct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Uc0JeNSnT5ykvrhAC4FK&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention. &lt;strong&gt;THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IF POSSIBLE, USE A VISUAL CUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/MG5zRFudQK6l9DWAyUEz&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;837&quot; height=&quot;521&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't add things you don't understand. Otherwise, expect frustration. The same card will be wrong multiple days, marked as a leech and a waste of time. [See Antipatterns, Useful Links]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of your Anki cards should be as simple as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add additional context for hard questions. If you get a card wrong, it's helpful to know more about the topic. I prefer adding in the extra info with cloze cards. For basic or basic + reversed cards, I'll have a succinct answer on Line 1, line breaks, Lines 3+ will be additional information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/lsE5yRuET0GOftafLx2m&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a card with multiple answers, add hints (HINT: Begins with a P...). When adding, you won't realize a question has multiple answers, but when you're reviewing, you'll know. Try to avoid this and write better questions with single answers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Gk8XaK75QR2yWVgwi77C&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1134&quot; height=&quot;155&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't Add Cards Memorizing Entire Lists. Too easily forgotten. You might remember Points 1, 2, 4 today and tomorrow only remember Points 1, 2, 3.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If necessary, use a cloze to memorize lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists can be memorized using the loci method. [See: Learning Strategies]&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/15dguZUQTRFMufUHgj8w&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I added the above into a single &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;basic&lt;/span&gt; card — &lt;em&gt;Q: &quot;What are the dates and milestones of Deep Learning Ideas?&quot; A:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;6&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long forgettable list&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; A cloze is a better approach. I can get one or two facts wrong without having to redo the card.&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/Sk0br5OkQDiKRPi3dIeO&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid importing online Anki decks. Similar to note taking, your own materials have better retention and comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When studying offline material, don't simultaneously create cards. Instead, highlight/circle the topics, write the Anki question you would have asked and finish studying. After the study session (or tomorrow) review your circled questions and add it to Anki. This is referred as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes&quot;&gt;Cornell Notes system&lt;/a&gt;. [See: Studying and Learning]
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding cards when offline studying is risky, it's too easy to end in a Wikipedia rabbit hole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've added cards, sync Anki (keyboard shortcut: Y) before leaving your house or office. Review during commute. &lt;strong&gt;Make this a habit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When watching online videos/lectures, I frequently create Basic cards and use screenshots as answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/dWoyxgCS5iDuweAlELbH&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;857&quot; height=&quot;583&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For sites that have a detailed explanation (StackOverflow answers), I also use a screenshot instead of dealing with formatting. I'm lazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tradeoff of screenshots is they can't be easily searched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you forget an Anki card (that you've already added and should know) add a similar question worded slightly differently. Spaced repetition isn't perfect, so asking the same question in a different way helps drill an answer.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another alternative is to add an Anki card asking &quot;what term did you forget about when you were talking to [person]?&quot;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/4s5Pciq5TqmPdxaNEs07&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't care about grammar, formatting or spelling (apologies about some card examples ...). You shouldn't either. Only you review your cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include where you learned it. Helps links back visually. Human brains are weird. Personalizing a card helps recall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/YrdARDQ5SYWXVh5obE3r&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height=&quot;508&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're going to paste a paragraph that uses a cloze term multiple times, use a find and replace (I like using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt; to do this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add names to faces. Thoughtful teachers add an entire class of student faces to names prior to the first day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer cards in random order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add-Ons / Plugins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKUP YOUR ANKI DECK BEFORE INSTALLING ADD-ONS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complete Anki add-ons list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Normally sorting by ratings is a reasonable heuristic (sorting is currently broken). Avoid add-ons that are less than a year old; there are stories about add-ons accidentally deleting cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all add-ons play nicely with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uninstall an add-on if you don't intend to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously, back up your deck first&lt;/strong&gt;. I normally review the source code before installing any add-ons. Many have dubious code quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Night Mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saves your eyes, seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1463041493&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Syntax Highlighter for Code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes it really really easy to highlight syntax code. I use an earlier version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it much easier to add cards related to Coding Snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Power Format Pack&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like Syntax Highlighter for ease-of-use, but this another common way to format your Anki cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Image Occlusion&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're a medical student, this is for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorize shortcuts to add Anki cards faster. Meta-Anki: Use Anki to memorize Anki shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don't have Windows examples, but similar strategies apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortcuts Example : How To Quickly Add An Anki Card on Mac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alt + Tab to Anki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit A to enable Add A Card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the card front&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the card back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift + Enter to enter the card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esc to main screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt + Tab to go back to what I was working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/QQXD8F0IRVmrjYfcE8Gg&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;709&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to make adding cards seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki Shortcuts (Mac):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Action&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shortcut (Mac)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Add A Card Prompt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Add A Card&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shift + Enter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Close&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Esc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Create A Cloze Card&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + Shift + C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Select Card Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Change Deck Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cmd + D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use keyboard keys. 1 (Again), 2 (Hard), 3 (Good), or 4 (Easy). Easier than using mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/5I3kn2lTZKgwZq2TXalv&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitting Spacebar defaults to Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Tips and Tricks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer reviewing on Mobile. Since I normally review during my commute, mobile is imperative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable App Gestures.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set Swipe Left to &lt;strong&gt;Answer button 1&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Again / Fail&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Swipe Right to &lt;strong&gt;Answer button 2&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Hard&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make all the taps to &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Show answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/gAjwE2G9RNDOtcF2v8Gc&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;551&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it really useful on the train / bus since you can review Anki with one hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.49275362318841&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;s1qo48hh-0 bThxNZ&quot; readability=&quot;11.826086956522&quot;&gt;Credit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/biyjtc/everything_i_know_a_comprehensive_guide_of/em51feo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minh0&lt;/a&gt;: Brought up a valid criticism about Swipe difficulty.  While my default Swipe Right - Correct is &quot;Answer Button 2&quot;, which means Hard. Some users (especially those with large medical Anki cards) may prefer to have it to be &quot;Answer Button 3&quot; which means Good. Otherwise, the amount of cards to review doesn't decrease fast enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DGcWpr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;phone ring&lt;/a&gt;. You can now swipe left and right on one hand easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make It A Favorite / Docked App for Easier Access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Autosyncing. The app will now sync when you open or when you've finished a deck (per 30 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Nightmode. Both the Android and iOS app have this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have more than fifteen minutes of Anki, turn on airplane mode first. Your phone/tablet's notifications were made to distract you. Turn back on after reviewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;General &lt;strong&gt;Reviewing Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I prefer using mobile (Phone / Tablet) to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have time, think about where you learned the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you're finished a deck, you have the option to review any forgotten cards in the last X days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/riqCXd3IQheiyZcrc2Fl&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;309&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review forgotten cards in decks that you're willing to overstudy and improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing forgotten cards is a great way to use mnemonics and visual imagery to remember. Because visual imagery takes a bit longer to think about, I save it for cards that I'm forgetting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing forgotten is useful when you've finished reviewing and want to burn some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on your deck, try not to reviewing forgotten cards too many days back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a reasonable amount of Anki cards and you're committed to Anki — I recommend buying an android tablet. It makes reviewing easier. I know this is ridiculous. A tablet has a few benefits over your phone:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger reading space. The 8'' is a perfect tablet size to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer the Android App over iOS. I've tried Anki on a Samsung and Apple tablet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tablets have less distractions than your phone. (Less calls, texts and emails).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a review, you might find something wrong with a card. If it's not easily fixable, star it. Don't edit it now, finish your review session and batch fix incorrect starred cards later. On a weekend, you can open up Anki via desktop and select &quot;All Starred Cards&quot; and make edits.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you'll forget why you starred a card for an error. I will write a little note next to the card what's missing (cloze, formatting, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it's the last card in a Deck, and you've gotten it wrong a few times, be careful. You're likely think you remembered it because of the recency. I recommend slowly reviewing or making an extensive mental image of the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Spacebar to go to the next card. [See: Shortcuts]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Night Mode Add-On. Your eyes thank me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use learning strategies. [Learning and Study Methods]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Time for Anki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dead Time is Anki Time
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to go on Reddit, HackerNews, social media, etc. finish your Anki deck first. Or at the very least, try to do five cards. Use Anki as a source to procrastinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends are frequently late. I do Anki when waiting. If they're really late, I'll start a review forgotten session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Times To Do Anki:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-productive meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting in line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twenty minutes of movie trailers before a movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having trouble with Anki, I recommend printing out a calendar, putting it on your fridge and writing an X everyday if you attempted 10 minutes. Don't make the goal to finish your entire deck, but just that you spent 10 minutes. Having low expectations of a task is a great way to avoid anxiety and just start. Known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seinfeld Method / Don't Break the Chain&lt;/a&gt;. Habit Tracker is another app that is great for tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking yourself in a room without WiFi is another sadistic, but effective method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm frequently pulled into non-productive meetings (classic engineer gripe). I'll just do Anki on my laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your commute style. I found myself preferring a bus over a train that added fifteen minutes to my commute. The bus gave me a seat and uninterrupted time to review. On the other hand, New York trains were too chaotic to get into a good rhythm to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find Anki + Tablet + Notebook + Good Food at a Restaurant is a really enjoyable way to review. I'll normally write down any answers I get wrong into the notebook, ponder about why I got them wrong and enjoy some really good food. Since I'll normally go to the same restaurant, I always end up being friends with the restaurant stuff. This tactic is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/too-lazy-to-work-out-try-temptation-bundling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;temptation bundling&lt;/a&gt;, combining something really good (food) with something that's work (reviewing). The making friends is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deck Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The community advice is to have all your cards merged in one deck. This has two main benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It reduces the Anki context problem - this happens when you can only remember the answer from an Anki app, but not in real-world situations. Similar to below. This is also referred to as interleaving&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/khmYKSTTRwaRRe1aUfOE&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;99&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It boosts creativity. Having two completely unrelated cards helps think about problems in different ways. Quizzing about tornados and binary-tree algorithms makes me visit the problem in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That being said, I have multiple decks. There are some benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very useful for new jobs: Have a new job deck and add all your work related cards in there. Review it at a much higher frequency (+ use review forgotten). Your learning rate and the speed of recall will improve.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can accelerate learning on a particular topic if I make a custom deck for it. Spaced repetition algorithms maximize efficiency of memory, sometimes I don't care about efficiency and want to brute-force improve at underlying material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm debating trying a new topic (math, music, etc), I will add that material to a new deck. That way if I decide I hate this topic, I can delete/avoid the entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much easier to avoid decks you don't have enough time to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can listen to different types of music depending on decks. For easy decks I listen to pop music. Harder decks require music with a slower cadence. My &quot;definitions&quot; deck is a relatively easy deck; I listen to fun music there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm learning one new topic, I will throw everything into the default deck. If I'm learning two different topics, I will have two different decks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, at 20-25 decks it gets a bit messy. Probably merge some at that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of deck decisions are based on your learning and studying habits. It's trivially easy to combine everything into one deck later, the inverse isn't true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of my deck strategies can be done similarly via tags. Personally, tags weren't really as useful as decks. They required more time to make, and the way to review specific tags required too much customization. I also felt that the mobile apps weren't really good for tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person varies. If you find yourself using a tagging system in Evernote, OneNote, etc. then you may want to approach Anki with tags. If you don't (myself personally), then tags probably won't work for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some useful advice by redditor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/biocuk/everything_i_know_a_comprehensive_guide_of/em2b3cd?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cubicpillow about the benefits of tags vs. decks&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don't review by tags but I use them to keep my cards organized. Tags have the advantage of being able to have multiple tags (i.e. I might have a card with the tags music theory, banjo, banjo exercise).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I do like to keep as many cards in one deck as possible, but I'll break out separate decks if I require a specific tool or setting to review them. BJJ cards are best reviewed with a training partner to drill with. Banjo cards require a banjo. Slight of hand cards require props, Spanish cards are better with sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning &amp;amp; Study Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I cannot create, I do not understand. — Richard Feynman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people use Anki as a way to amplify memory. I use Anki for memory AND to fundamentally learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use multimodal study strategies. Using different modes of learning can enforce an idea.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the answer out loud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it out. For wrong answers, I'll write it on paper. The act of writing is meditative. I really enjoy this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study in a different location than normal (different coffee shops, public locations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize the answer (see below).
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many others. The point is changing your study patterns helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning: To become world-class, you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt;. That requires expertise in fundamentals.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This strategy only applies to topics you want long-term mastery. I only use this for a subset. Be picky. It's impossible to apply first principles thinking to your entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm trying to learn from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt;, I'll write and draw mind maps &amp;amp; diagrams. This takes considerably more time to review, but makes similar concepts easier to grok. Mindmaps are a great way to stabilize topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping on asking yourself why? why does this work? why does it work this way? Force yourself to understand the root of a topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cornell Method&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When reading a topic, write out questions on the margins to quiz yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend You Have to Teach It
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Works incredibly well. Help realize knowledge gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend you have to explain it to a five year old for extra difficulty. Only allow yourself to use basic vocabulary and concepts. If you can't explain it simply, then you don't really know it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Exquisite Visual Imagery
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you make very intense mental visual images, you'll remember it for life. he visual image doesn't have to make sense (most of my don't). &lt;em&gt;Q: What's the capital of Romania? A: Bucharest.&lt;/em&gt; I have a disturbing image of Romans being conquerors and butchering an innocent village at rest. butcher-at-rest, butch-at-rest, Bucharest. I know this sounds very silly, but visual imagery really works. Don't worry, you won't fool yourself into thinking Romania are Romans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mnemonics phrases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pemdas-definition-rule-examples.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PEMDAS&lt;/a&gt; for lists and other hard-to-remember topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't know an answer, try to force yourself to reason what the answer could be.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow and hard, but very useful in first principle thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Memory Palace&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Loci Method&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think about the room you grew up. Weird how you can still remember ... Now put an Anki term interacting with an object from the room. &lt;strong&gt;Visualize the term really hard&lt;/strong&gt;. When you wake up tomorrow, you'll still remember the term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is useful for memorizing extensive lists. I will go counter-clockwise in a room and make every item in a list interact with something from my childhood bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studying Before Bedtime
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Useful for reviewing forgotten cards. I don't recommend trying to do your daily review session at night though, it's too easy to fall asleep and be backlogged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful if you suffering from insomnia and want to get your mind on something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend the word makes a sound describing something else. Q: 'How do I use Python's DictWriter to output a line?' A: writer.writerow(). I like to make this stupid sound of &quot;ruh row&quot;, like a sad &quot;oh no!&quot;. It works. This example is so embarrassing and ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a checklist of first principles reasoning and meta-learning tactics when reviewing Anki. I'll write about it sometime later, but it didn't fit in this guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Deleting Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get over your gripe about deleting cards. If you find yourself forgetting a crappy card or just never want to see the card again, delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delete Cards That Don't Make Sense
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can't fix it with a batched star (and edit later), delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having issues with a particular card for multiple days, it may be a poorly written card. Delete and write it in a clear way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Bad Programming Languages You Don't Use
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After a few years, I can safely say I won't need PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Things You Don't Want To Remember Anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't feel bad that you studied a card months ago and forgot it. It happens. If you no longer care for the card, delete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're still too scared to delete, you can also suspend cards to edit later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with Spaced Repetition Burnout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is when you feel overwhelmed and don't want to review cards. It frequently happens when you've added too many cards quickly. You've missed a few review sessions and now have a couple of hundred cards to review. Or you have too many cards you don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a way to just start: Leave your location and commit to one &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; (25 minutes) of Anki at your favorite coffee shop. Turn on airplane mode. Jam to your favorite music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're feeling overwhelmed, go out for a ten minute walk. Then when you come back, if you still don't want to do your daily Anki, don't. The mental agreement helps me start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable with deleting cards that cause you frustration. [See: Deleting Cards]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, only review a deck you're passionate about until you can get back into a daily rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid burnout:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding too many cards too quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't fall too far behind on Anki reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding too many cards that you don't fully understand. Too many difficult cards causes frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable deleting / suspending frustrating cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't try to trick yourself w/quirky questions. You may think you can ask a question in a misleading way to trick yourself will make you remember the topic better, but it just trips me in the long-run.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Normal Example — &lt;em&gt;Q: Programming: How do I &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; and add all messages and files? A: git commit -am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tricky Example — &lt;em&gt;Q: Programming: How do I &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; and add all messages and files? A: git commit -am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem now is your brain remembers the word &quot;&lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and the next time you think of &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;, your brain goes &quot;wait, did you use &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; as trick term or was it &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;? ARGH&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't keep forgetful cards even if you've spent time trying to remember (sunk cost fallacy). You'll find certain cards you remember for a few months and then inevitably forget. Some cards aren't worth it. Delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't turn on the Auto Next Card feature. Way too easy to mess up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't explain Anki to a newcomer by showing the first card of your deck. Luck says it will always be of something embarrassing you read from an article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different types of music will subtly change your review speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EDM/POP Music? I KNOW EVERYTHING TODAY. I then review cards a little too quickly ... the euphoria makes me overconfident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical Music? Slows me down, makes me more thoughtful. Not as fun tho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Community Tips from Reddit and Other Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I use Anki to memorize vocabulary as well. So what I do instead of asking What word means {{Definition}}, I use colons to introduce a definition like : {{Definition}}. That way I could add two or three meanings, which also helps to differentiate words that have similar definitions. Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/plain_tshirt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plain_tshirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Antipatterns / Applicable Only To Odd People Like Myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I frequently add entire Wikipedia descriptions as cloze cards (about a topic I don't understand yet). Because I also use Anki as my learning pad, I know I'll sit down and study this knowledge. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/syrlcPZgRlegnY0IEj51&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;815&quot; height=&quot;198&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point, it's trivially easy and intoxicating to add facts from articles. Previously, if the Wall Street Journal mentioned a person's background and alma matter, I added it. This was useless. Add knowledge if helpful; if not, it's probably not worth knowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having trouble with remembering cards (my brain ignores certain topics), delete them. Spaced repetition isn't about spaced torture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useless Things I Don't Add Anymore
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Birthdates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw Numbers. Like 2016 United States GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politician Names / Faces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop Culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Misc:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Explaining Anki — From time to time, people will ask random sorcery is Anki. It's hard to explain verbally spaced repetition, but drawing out the memory curve is effective for the person to get the &quot;aha&quot; moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/7m31dpYBQyu3z6ueXhFG&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sync Conflicts. If you get a sync conflict like the below ... pick the source that has the most cards. You might have to repeat a daily review, but it's better than losing cards you created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/6qzXj0qcTLW5gKctTM8Q&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes I'm a lazy buffoon. I tried adding motivational techniques in Anki, but that doesn't help. Q: How should you get out of bed when you don't feel like it? A: Use a five second rule. Five, four, three AND THEN GET OUT OF BED. Result? I remembered the five second rule and continued snoozing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategies I've Been Meaning To Try (But Haven't)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these aren't hard truths. Your brain is different (and probably smarter) than mine. You'll devise your own strategies based on how you study and learn. Visual imagery though - that tip is GOLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Articles Per Request&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meta-Learning — First Principles and Foundations Checklist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll be releasing a program that correlates Sleep, Nutrition, and Supplements on Anki and memory in the two months. I'm a quantified-self fan.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>OpenAI releases larger GPT-2 model</title>
<link>https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#update</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#update</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;js-excerpt&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization—all without task-specific training.&lt;/p&gt;

Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model. As an experiment in responsible disclosure, we are instead releasing a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot;&gt;smaller model&lt;/a&gt; for researchers to experiment with, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf&quot;&gt;technical paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 is a large &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&quot;&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt;-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation. In addition, GPT-2 outperforms other language models trained on specific domains (like Wikipedia, news, or books) without needing to use these domain-specific training datasets. On language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these tasks from the raw text, using no task-specific training data. While scores on these downstream tasks are far from state-of-the-art, they suggest that the tasks can benefit from unsupervised techniques, given sufficient (unlabeled) data and compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;Samples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 generates synthetic text samples in response to the model being primed with an arbitrary input. The model is chameleon-like—it adapts to the style and content of the conditioning text. This allows the user to generate realistic and coherent continuations about a topic of their choosing, as seen by the following select samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The incident occurred on the downtown train line, which runs from Covington and Ashland stations.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;In an email to Ohio news outlets, the U.S. Department of Energy said it is working with the Federal Railroad Administration to find the thief.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“The theft of this nuclear material will have significant negative consequences on public and environmental health, our workforce and the economy of our nation,” said Tom Hicks, the U.S. Energy Secretary, in a statement. “Our top priority is to secure the theft and ensure it doesn’t happen again.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The stolen material was taken from the University of Cincinnati’s Research Triangle Park nuclear research site, according to a news release from Department officials.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not immediately release any information.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;According to the release, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Security is leading that team’s investigation.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“The safety of people, the environment and the nation’s nuclear stockpile is our highest priority,” Hicks said. “We will get to the bottom of this and make no excuses.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve trained a large language model called GPT-2 that generates realistic paragraphs of text, while also exhibiting zero shot generalization on tasks like machine translation, question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization - problems usually approached by using training datasets and models designed explicitly for these tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical approach to language modeling is to learn the following task: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. Last year, OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) showed that language models trained on large amounts of data can be fine-tuned to specific tasks to achieve high performance. GPT-2 shows that much larger language models trained on a more diverse dataset derived from the internet begin to learn these NLP tasks without needing task-specific training data, instead learning from examples the system derives from the raw text. These systems also display a substantial qualitative jump in the realism and coherence of generated text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We are now preparing a collection of datasets for translation and machine translation in our language model. We will be using one of the large number of text samples provided by The New York Times.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We believe this project is the first step in the direction of developing large NLP systems without task-specific training data. That is, we are developing a machine language system in the generative style with no explicit rules for producing text.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We hope for future collaborations between computer scientists, linguists, and machine learning researchers.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The orcs’ response was a deafening onslaught of claws, claws, and claws; even Elrond was forced to retreat. “You are in good hands, dwarf,” said Gimli, who had been among the first to charge at the orcs; it took only two words before their opponents were reduced to a blood-soaked quagmire, and the dwarf took his first kill of the night. The battle lasted for hours until two of the largest Orcs attempted to overwhelm Aragorn. When they finally stopped, they lay defeated and lifeless for miles and miles.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I take nothing,” said Aragorn. “But I give my word, at my peril and mine, that I will never forget this day of horror. None of us will forget. Ever!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I’ll never forget it!” cried Gimli, who had been in the thick of the battle but hadn’t taken part in it. One of the wounded orcs he had carried off, he was the only one of the survivors who remained uninjured. “We’ll keep the memory of that day of evil, and the war with it, alive as long as we live, my friends!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“Then we’ll keep it alive as long as we live,” added Legolas. “And we won’t forget the first great battle of the night, even if we may have forgotten the final defeat.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I agree,” Gandalf said, “but we will all remember it as the last battle in Middle-earth, and the first great battle of the new day.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Aragorn drew his sword, and the Battle of Fangorn was won. As they marched out through the thicket the morning mist cleared, and the day turned to dusk.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The Two Rings were returned to Rivendell. Frodo and Sam woke up alone in their room, and Frodo found a note on his pillow. He opened it and read:&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;May the Power of the Ring be with you always, and may its light never fade. I am not sure if it matters which of the two rings we accept this day but, as you asked me, I have chosen mine. I am sorry to leave you, Frodo, but know that we are very close to the end, and that you are with us forever. May this letter find you safely in Rivendell; and if it does not, then I will accept the ring in your stead. If by any chance you find or give this letter to the enemy, may they learn the strength of the ring and may the Two Rings never be broken!&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;By Donny Ferguson&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But that's not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. You're not wrong about that, but it's kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states' rights and federalism. So let's try again. What's the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;In 1791, Thomas Jefferson said &quot;Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&quot; The &quot;founding fathers&quot; were basically religious men who were not very concerned with states' rights. The Civil War occurred in reaction to the idea that the federal government was taking far too much power away from the states, that they weren't sovereign. Jefferson himself, as you well know, is an author of the Declaration of Independence who had some really crazy ideas about, well, you know, secession for a variety of reasons. The War Between the States (later the Great Rebellion) was a radical re-imagining of the American idea and not surprisingly, Jefferson's grandson, who took after both his father and his grandfather and wrote about it, was named Thomas, after the president. &quot;The federal and state governments are both contrived for the benefit of the rich and large property,&quot; This view of the Founding Fathers has been promoted by some of today's most prominent politicians, including some who hold prominent national offices and have a direct stake in a Republican Party that has been hijacked by the &quot;federalist&quot; wing of the party. So why is it that so many people have an easy-to-spot way of understanding the Civil War that has everything to do with the South and nothing to do with the South? The Confederate flag has been a symbol of racism for a long time, but when the Civil War started and the Civil War ended, many people suddenly began to see it differently. There was a change of heart, which I think is what led people to take the question of why the Civil War happened quite seriously.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The other part of the explanation is what one scholar I think gets at well and a lot of people don't is this idea that the Southern states were being left behind in the Industrial Revolution and this made the South really feel, especially in the South, that they weren't really in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;It is time once again. I believe this nation can do great things if the people make their voices heard. The men and women of America must once more summon our best elements, all our ingenuity, and find a way to turn such overwhelming tragedy into the opportunity for a greater good and the fulfillment of all our dreams. In the months and years to come, there will be many battles in which we will have to be strong and we must give all of our energy, not to repel invaders, but rather to resist aggression and to win the freedom and the equality for all of our people. The destiny of the human race hangs in the balance; we cannot afford for it to slip away. Now and in the years to come, the challenge before us is to work out how we achieve our ultimate destiny. If we fail to do so, we are doomed.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;We, the descendants of the men and women of the Continental Army, who faced down a superior force on behalf of our independence and who fought against the evil powers of the world for the sake of freedom and human dignity, we, the heirs of men and women like Daniel Boone whom this country has produced, can accomplish our destiny as well as you have accomplished yours; and we pledge ourselves before the entire world, every second of every day.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;After the election, the President of the United States asked for a &quot;more complete&quot; body of information on Kennedy's brains' origin. In an e-mail exchange with me, Dr. Robert Wood, who, according to Wikipedia is the head of the University of Maryland Advanced Nanotechnology Research project, provided the following information:&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;(1) The brain of JFK was harvested and reconstructed via tissue sampling. There was no way that the tissue could be transported by air. (2) A sample was collected from the area around his upper chest and sent to the University of Maryland for analysis. A human brain at that point would be about one and a half cubic centimeters. The data were then analyzed along with material that was obtained from the original brain to produce a reconstruction; in layman's terms, a &quot;mesh&quot; of brain tissue. There were no additional funds from the Department of Defense involved. The samples were sent back to the FBI lab for review and analysis. (3) There was never an attempt to clone any of America's greatest presidents. As far as we knew, the President was one of the most famous people on planet earth. If it had been possible, it would have.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Recycling is NOT good for the world. It is bad for the environment, it is bad for our health, and it is bad for our economy. I'm not kidding. Recycling is not good for the environment. It is destructive to the earth and it is a major contributor to global warming. Recycling is not good for our health. It contributes to obesity and diseases like heart disease and cancer. Recycling is bad for our economy. It increases the cost of a product, and in turn, the price of everything that is made with that product. Recycling is not good for our nation. We pay a tremendous price for the privilege of having the world's most advanced and efficient recycling system. Recycling is a huge, colossal waste of time, energy, money, and resources. And THAT is why we need to get back to basics and get back to basics in our recycling efforts. One of the best ways to start is to look at the process of creating a paper product. When you make a paper product, it is basically a long chain of materials. Everything from the raw materials (wood, cardboard, paper, etc.), to the reagents (dyes, solvents, etc.) to the printing equipment (chemicals, glue, paper, ink, etc.), to the packaging, to the packaging materials (mercury, chemicals, etc.) to the processing equipment (heating, cooling, etc.), to the packaging materials, to the packaging materials that are shipped overseas and to the packaging materials that are used in the United States. Each step along the way creates tons of waste that we constantly have to clean up. The process of making a paper product is a very wasteful one. But the end result is something that all of us need to consume. And if we want to keep the recycling process running efficiently, then we really need to think about each and every step that goes into making a paper product.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the above samples show, our model is capable of generating samples from a variety of prompts that feel close to human quality and show coherence over a page or more of text. Nevertheless, we have observed various failure modes, such as repetitive text, world modeling failures (e.g. the model sometimes writes about &lt;em&gt;fires happening under water&lt;/em&gt;), and unnatural topic switching. Exploring these types of weaknesses of language models is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811&quot;&gt;active&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03055&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03185&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the natural language processing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we find that it takes a few tries to get a good sample, with the number of tries depending on how familiar the model is with the context. When prompted with topics that are highly represented in the data (Brexit, Miley Cyrus, Lord of the Rings, and so on), it seems to be capable of generating reasonable samples about 50% of the time. The opposite is also true: on highly technical or esoteric types of content, the model can perform poorly. Fine-tuning offers the potential for even more detailed control over generated samples—for example, we can fine-tune GPT-2 on the Amazon Reviews dataset and use this to let us write reviews conditioned on things like star rating and category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These samples have substantial policy implications: large language models are becoming increasingly easy to steer towards scalable, customized, coherent text generation, which in turn could be used in a number of beneficial as well as malicious ways. We'll discuss these implications below in more detail, and outline a publication experiment we are taking in light of such considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zeroshot&quot;&gt;Zero-shot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 achieves state-of-the-art scores on a variety of domain-specific language modeling tasks. Our model is not trained on any of the data specific to any of these tasks and is only evaluated on them as a final test; this is known as the &quot;zero-shot&quot; setting. GPT-2 outperforms models trained on domain-specific datasets (e.g. Wikipedia, news, books) when evaluated on those same datasets. The following table shows all our state-of-the-art zero-shot results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(+) means a higher score is better for this domain. (-) means a lower score is better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay was run from March 24 until August 8, 2008, prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the theme of &quot;one world, one dream&quot;. Plans for the relay were announced on April 26, 2007, in Beijing, China. The relay, also called by the organizers as the &quot;Journey of Harmony&quot;, lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi) – the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch traveled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch was following a route passing through six continents. The torch has visited cities along the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. The relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China from the Chinese side, which was closed specially for the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the theme?&lt;br/&gt;A: &quot;one world, one dream&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the length of the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: 137,000 km&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Was it larger than previous ones?&lt;br/&gt;A: No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did the race begin?&lt;br/&gt;A: Olympia, Greece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Is there anything notable about that place?&lt;br/&gt;A: birthplace of Olympic Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did they go after?&lt;br/&gt;A: Athens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How many days was the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Did they visit any notable landmarks?&lt;br/&gt;A: Panathinaiko Stadium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cave mimics famous Caverne du Pont-d'Arc in France, the oldest cave decorated by man and the best preserved. The replica contains all 1,000 paintings which include 425 such as a woolly rhinoceros and mammoths. Minute details were copied using 3D modelling and anamorphic techniques, often used to shoot widescreen images. The modern cave also includes replica paw prints of bears, bones and details preserved in the original cave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model translation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;samp&gt;A man told me that the operation gratuity he had been promised would not allow him to travel.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that since these tasks are a subset of general language modeling, we can expect performance to increase further with more compute and data. Others have published &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11373&quot;&gt;similar hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;. We also expect fine-tuning to help performance on downstream tasks, though we have yet to do thorough experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;policyimplications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large, general language models could have significant societal impacts, and also have many near-term applications. We can anticipate how systems like GPT-2 could be used to create:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI writing assistants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More capable dialogue agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupervised translation between languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better speech recognition systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also imagine the application of these models for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/preparing-for-malicious-uses-of-ai/&quot;&gt;malicious purposes&lt;/a&gt;, including the following (or other applications we can't yet anticipate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate misleading news articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonate others online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of spam/phishing content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery, audio, and video, imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content and waging disinformation campaigns. The public at large will need to become more skeptical of text they find online, just as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3213954&quot;&gt;deep fakes&lt;/a&gt;&quot; phenomenon calls for more skepticism about images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, malicious actors—some of which are political in nature—have already begun to target the shared online commons, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/the-new-censors-wont-delete-your-words--theyll-drown-them-out/2019/02/08/c8a926a2-2b27-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html&quot;&gt;things like&lt;/a&gt; “robotic tools, fake accounts and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary or smears that make them afraid to speak, or difficult to be heard or believed”. We should consider how research into the generation of synthetic images, videos, audio, and text may further combine to unlock new as-yet-unanticipated capabilities for these actors, and should seek to create better technical and non-technical countermeasures. Furthermore, the underlying technical innovations inherent to these systems are core to fundamental artificial intelligence research, so it is not possible to control research in these domains without slowing down the progress of AI as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;releasestrategy&quot;&gt;Release Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/&quot;&gt;much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code&lt;/a&gt;. We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights. Nearly a year ago we wrote in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Charter&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research,&quot; and we see this current work as potentially representing the early beginnings of such concerns, which we expect may grow over time. This decision, as well as our discussion of it, is an experiment: while we are not sure that it is the right decision today, we believe that the AI community will eventually need to tackle the issue of publication norms in a thoughtful way in certain research areas. Other disciplines such as biotechnology and cybersecurity have long had active debates about responsible publication in cases with clear misuse potential, and we hope that our experiment will serve as a case study for more nuanced discussions of model and code release decisions in the AI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will further publicly discuss this strategy in six months. If you’d like to discuss large language models and their implications, please email us at: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:languagequestions@openai.com&quot;&gt;languagequestions@openai.com&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’re excited about working on cutting-edge language models (and thinking through their policy implications), &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;mb-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;pt-0.5 d-block&quot; id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;GPT-2 Interim Update, May 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're implementing two mechanisms to responsibly publish GPT-2 and hopefully future releases: staged release and partnership-based sharing. We're now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; a larger 345M version of GPT-2 as a next step in staged release, and are sharing the 762M and 1.5B versions with partners in the AI and security communities who are working to improve societal preparedness for large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;stagedrelease&quot;&gt;Staged Release&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staged release involves the gradual release of a family of models over time. The purpose of our staged release of GPT-2 is to give people time to assess the properties of these models, discuss their societal implications, and evaluate the impacts of release after each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the next step in our staged release strategy, we are releasing the 345M parameter version of GPT-2. This model features improved performance relative to the 117M version, though falls short of the 1.5B version with respect to the ease of generating coherent text. We have been excited to see so many positive uses of GPT-2-117M, and hope that 345M will yield still more benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the misuse risk of 345M is higher than that of 117M, we believe it is substantially lower than that of 1.5B, and we believe that training systems of similar capability to GPT-2-345M is well within the reach of many actors already; this evolving replication landscape has informed our decision-making about what is appropriate to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making our 345M release decision, some of the factors we considered include: the ease of use (by various users) of different model sizes for generating coherent text, the role of humans in the text generation process, the likelihood and timing of future replication and publication by others, evidence of use in the wild and expert-informed inferences about unobservable uses, proofs of concept such as the review generator mentioned in the original blog post, the strength of demand for the models for beneficial purposes, and the input of stakeholders and experts. We remain uncertain about some of these variables and continue to welcome input on how to make appropriate language model publication decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that ongoing research on bias, detection, and misuse will give us the confidence to publish larger models in a timely manner, and at the six month mark we will share a fuller analysis of language models’ societal implications and our heuristics for release decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;partnerships&quot;&gt;Partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since releasing this blog post in February, we have had conversations with many external researchers, technology companies, and policymakers about our release strategy and the implications of increasingly large language models. We’ve also presented or discussed our work at events, including a dinner co-hosted with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.partnershiponai.org/when-is-it-appropriate-to-publish-high-stakes-ai-research/&quot;&gt;Partnership on AI&lt;/a&gt; and a presentation to policymakers in Washington DC at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/r/gec/tech/index.htm&quot;&gt;Global Engagement Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently forming research partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, and industry labs focused on increasing societal preparedness for large language models. In particular, we are sharing the 762M and 1.5B parameter versions of GPT-2 to facilitate research on language model output detection, language model bias analysis and mitigation, and analysis of misuse potential. In addition to observing the impacts of language models in the wild, engaging in dialogue with stakeholders, and conducting in-house analysis, these research partnerships will be a key input to our decision-making on larger models. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#talktous&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;outputdataset&quot;&gt;Output Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; a dataset of GPT-2 outputs from all 4 model sizes, with and without top-k truncation, as well as a subset of the WebText corpus used to train GPT-2. The output dataset features approximately 250,000 samples per model/hyperparameter pair, which we expect is sufficient to help a wider range of researchers perform quantitative and qualitative analysis on the three topics above. Alongside these datasets, we are including a baseline analysis of some detection-related properties of the models, which we hope others will be able to quickly build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;talktous&quot;&gt;Talk to Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in collaborating with researchers working on language model output detection, bias, and publication norms, and with organizations potentially affected by large language models: please reach out at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:languagepartners@openai.com&quot;&gt;languagepartners@openai.com&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, OpenAI’s language, safety, and policy teams will be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iclr.cc/&quot;&gt;ICLR&lt;/a&gt; next week, including at the Reproducibility workshop and the OpenAI booth. In particular, we will be discussing this release strategy at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/iclr2019/schedule.htm&quot;&gt;AI for Social Good&lt;/a&gt; workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Better Language Models and Their Implications</og:title>
<og:description>We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization.</og:description>

<title>Rose Marie Bentley lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-type=&quot;sourceText&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ImageCaptionWrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
